You have to understand that rescue in water is a difficult thing and a panicked person will 9 out of 10 times drown you in attempting to save him/herself. I have firsthand experience of trying to save a friend in a swimming pool in my high school days (I was an inexperienced kid) and nearly drowned with him trying to suffocating my neck trying to save himself in his panic. (Managed to drag us both to the shallow end somehow that day!) The best way to save someone on the surface is to throw something to them \u2013 rope, long pole, inner tube, floats anything that they can cling on to and then rope/pull them in. Notice how most pool lifeguards have a long pole (on floats with ropes) and don\u2019t jump in the water until absolutely required. Also for someone under the surface, you have to be very strong to drag them up in the water. The best way it to always approach them from behind (otherwise you will be caught in their blind panic \u2013 and trust me a panicked person somehow gets 20% more strength than you!) and quickly overpower them to make sure you can quickly and decisively take control of the situation. In the end, I would still warn against trying to jump in the water to rescue someone without any kind of training or help until it is absolutely the last resort! Final Note \u2013 never jump in a river or open water (sea, large lakes) until you are a very strong swimmer and know the water body well (have been swimming in it for a few years minimum) as you don\u2019t know the current, what\u2019s under the water etc.",

They often speak in a jargon-dense diction, delivered at high velocity, one idea bouncing off another to produce a spiderweb of spiraling associations. The effect, rhetorically and aesthetically, is often overwhelming. Logic doesn\u2019t really play a role because one hardly knows what they are saying. The unwitting listener feels himself outmatched, drowned and blinded by the naked light of unbridled genius. The graduate student is a much dimmer light. He is still full of abstract phrases and obscure references, but he is someone who is starting to sound, again, like a human being \u2014 explaining things, pausing, asking questions to insure the listener is following. This is not nearly as impressive as the undergraduate, but it does have the virtue of allowing the ordinary among us to understand what is being said. The professor sounds like your basic \u201cdad,\u201d albeit one with a lot to say. He can at times seem unsure of himself. He pauses to define his terms and to add qualifications to his statements. He speaks carefully. He might even speak slowly. He explains as he goes, almost apologizing for whatever obscurities he falls into. His manner of speech is, well\u2026 designed to communicate! A quite boring and not evidently bright fellow, you almost feel embarrassed for him. In light of these observations, I was forced to conclude that there is either something terribly wrong with our educational system \u2014 since the higher people go the dumber they get \u2014 or intelligence is not quite what we sometimes think it is.Nobel Laureate Richard Feynman could teach physics to a hamster.",

They know all the established habits. They know all the right answers and tend make huge effort to take the leading position. It\u2019s just fine until the first \"this was not in the guidelines\" moment. Or a first question \"why?\" Stardust rubbers - people who constantly brag about people they\u2019d met and trying hard to imply as one of them. Includes citing a lot. Yes, I see you are good in remembering names, but can you come with your own idea? Overflowing with information: these people talk a lot. They have to be the only one to ask questions. Massive load of random facts and thoughts and meaningless fill. It\u2019s nice that you read different resources and educate yourself, but work with it. \"You are not intelligent enough to understand the grandiosity of my mind\" approach. Overflowing you with words you\u2019ve heard first time (and last) in your life and shallow philosophy. Having mastered an isolated skill which is usually an \u201cintelligent people thing\" like sudoku or Rubik\u2019s cube or having a very intellectual hobby like contemporary orchestral music and bragging about it. Overall - much noise, great self-confidence, little understanding, and a little meaningful output is not a sign of genuine intelligence.",

But the way a man\u2019s eyes watched me, or locked on mine, was an indicator of their love for me. The depth of their gaze, the intensity of expression, all revealed unspoken secrets.The way his eyes lit up at the sight of my own joy. We were watching a comedy show. I threw back my head, a loud, cackling laugh erupting from my stomach. When I opened my eyes again, I saw that he wasn\u2019t watching the show. Instead, his blissful gaze was locked on me. The way his eyes welled up when I was upset. He grabbed my hand and asked me to stay. To listen. He earnestly looked into my face, trying to alleviate my fears, to soothe my insecurities, to show me he was on my side. I heard his words, but it was his melting, warm eyes that told me he always would be on my side. The way his eyes remained calm in my presence. They never flashed frightening anger towards me. They remained peaceful prisms, a constant source of comfort. Once, I forgot about our dinner cooking and let it burn to a crisp. His eyes crinkled at the corners in a tinkling, reassuring smile. He laughingly drew me towards him, his arms enveloping me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll order pizza.\u201d The way his eyes radiated distress at my own discomfort. I was sick and told him he shouldn\u2019t come near me, he\u2019d only get sick too. I started heaving out great, racking coughs, my nose running into a tissue. He looked at me, his eyes the deepest pools of sincerity. Without any doubts, he told me he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. The way he watched me when I wasn\u2019t looking. I woke up, stretching and grunting into the consciousness of the morning. I opened my eyes to see him watching me, the most honeyed, doting look on his face. I was lying breathless after sex, and I turned to see his enraptured expression, his eyes burning with passionate fervor. In that moment, his eyes emitted a fierce affection. I was curled up on the couch, deeply engrossed in a book. I looked up to see him sitting across the room from me, watching me with a look of pure contentedness. Upon locking eyes with me he moved towards me, wrapping himself around my body, breathing softly into my skin. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked him, bemusedly. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying you. I\u2019m appreciating you.\u201d he said, looking up at me with those shining globes. In that moment, they were my whole world.

People who think along these lines are grossly misinformed, i.e. evolution doesn\u2019t posit we come from monkeys but rather we share an ancestor in common (indeed all life shares an ancestor in common); that is, at some point in the distant past monkeys went one way and the ancestors of modern humans branched off and went another. In 2005 a scientific paper confirmed the \u201ccommon ancestor\u201d hypothesis, i.e. Chimpanzees have 48 chromosomes and humans 46. If our two species are related, we should have the exact same total number of chromosomes. The study established that this is the case: one of our chromosomes is actually two chromosomes fused together; this fusion dropped our total number from 48 to 46 (while preserving the original primate information). The paper states: \u201cChromosome 2 is unique to the human lineage of evolution, having emerged as the result of head-to-head fusion of two chromosomes that remained separate in other primates.\u201d In fact, the molecular evidence for the fusion point is so strong that we can actually identify the exact region where the two chromosome tips were combined, where the two primate chromosomes were pasted together. Human chromosome 2 does indeed contain telomere DNA at its middle, at the fusion point, and it carries two centromere sequences corresponding to the centromeres from chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13. Furthermore, the genes on human chromosome 2 are arranged in an almost exact match for the patterns of corresponding genes on the two chimp chromosomes. So clear is the match, in fact, scientists working on the chimpanzee genome have now changed the numbering of chimp chromosomes 12 and 13 to chromosomes 2A and 2B, to match the human chromosome to which they correspond. The forensic case of the missing chromosome is settled beyond any doubt. This is discussed in great detail in Ken Miller\u2019s book Only a Theory, p.105-107.",

Humans and all other primates share a common ancestor, it is an established fact based on mountains of evidence. Our genus, homo, seems to have become distinct several million years ago, but it is likely that our group deviated from other primates a few million years before that. We can\u2019t be sure because we don\u2019t have a complete fossil record, but we do have a pretty firm understanding of how long these things take, so I would think it\u2019s pretty certain that we deviated from other lower primates 10-25 million years ago. Ok these long time scales it wasn\u2019t \u201cmonkeys\u201d we were splitting from, it was a distant primate ancestor. Monkeys in the present sense didn\u2019t exist then either. There could be some confusion because the primate ancestors were small and arboreal like monkeys today, and that is valid, but in the Cenozoic all ancestors start out small due to the mass extinction killing off all large animals. Just bad luck. We are distinctly different than monkeys today because we exploit a very different habitat and have done so for millions of years. Just like whales evolved from ungulates but they don\u2019t look like a horse now because they have different habitats than horses. Please don\u2019t be that person that thinks evolution is some kind of religious dogma. Evolution is an observed fact where there is no reasonable question about its existence. There are some minor details that could still go one way or the other, but to deny that evolution exists is about as productive as denying that math exists. Math just is, evolution is.",

The evidence for this is gathered primarily through analysis of RNA and DNA, and of course from the wealth of knowledge as to how evolution works. In answer to the second part of your question, if you're talking about whether there's anything specifically identifiable as half 'A', half 'B', the answer is no, since that's not how evolution works.  Under the normal course of events there's a slow adaptation, which can take millions of years, before there are enough changes so that 'B' is different enough from 'A' to be classed as a new species. There are of course many fossils which do show this slow transition from 'A' to 'B', however the fossil record is patchy in part for the simple reason that only a tiny proportion of creatures get fossilised after their death, and even when they do, only a tiny proportion of those fossils survive the geological changes which subsequently occur.  Then of course they have to be discovered and identified... But this patchiness of the fossil record certainly isn't enough to disprove evolution, there are far too many examples across many species to more than adequately demonstrate the evolutionary process from species 'A' to species 'B' at work.  Anyone who says otherwise - creationists for example - is both cherry-picking and distorting evidence, or ignoring it all together.",
            "Yes but the process took 3.8 billion years. Phylum chordata (our phylum) evolved during the early cambrian period (540 million years ago) and the evolution of mammals only become notable when the non-avian dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. Apes appeared many millions of years after that. Yes evolution began with single celled organisms, but that was a very long time ago.",

            "Please, just get over this nonsense that China can be avoided. China is the manufacturing hub of the world and is the reason that things are available at cheap prices and of good quality. If India bans Chinese products, India will be the one that will be adversely affected, and not the other way round as India accounts for only 2% of Chinese GDP while India has a significantly large share of imports, to the tune of nearly $60 billion.

Rather China has focused more on quantity, by riding on its low labour costs. Quantity has been somewhat effective in negating the qualitative effort.",

We don't have any manufacturing unit of any company in India OR we don't have any country owned semiconductor company. Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to create the integrated circuits that are present in everyday electrical and electronic devices.Semiconductor manufacturing, where silicon is melted and pulled into crystals is done in the US, Japan, Taiwan, China, Russia, Europe and Korea. China have manufacturing unit of TEXAS INSTRUMENTS , EXICON , ELNA , NIPPON CHEMI CON , SONY , ANALOG DEVICES , NXP, INFINEON , INTEL ,SAMSUNG ,STMICROELECTRONIC , VISHAY INTERNATIONAL, QUALCOMM, BROADCOM, NVIDIA, MEDIATEK , KIRIN Above all companies are foreign based .This type of silicon integrated chip which only manufactred in USA ,china, Japan, Germany {India didn't have any setup or individual who knows the process of MANUFACTURING Technics , No one knows about manufactring silicon chip , there is no education related to how silicon processor are made and built \u2026 That's why this is an also reason we cannot make any single chip of advance phone and we can't manufactre computer , smartphone , all integrated silicon based chips \u201cIndia lacks in that particular technology field\u201d The main reason is \"TECHNOLOGY\" not the money or market volume. We don't have any scientific knowledge neither technological expertise in semiconductor processing. Such knowledge & technology (single crystal generation, chemical diffusion, metal deposition, surface metrology, nm lithography etc) is listed under US export control list. So you can not buy those technologies does not matter how much money you spend, unless US Govt allows them to sale. Remember India buys Israeli Radar for 2B $, Old Russian Ship/submarine for ~B$ and others ..so as a country we have enough money, eagerness and we are ready to pay any sum of money to buy such technology. But the truth is nobody wants to sale us or give us those technology. Same is true for several other countries like European Unions. We were never in US favorite list of countries and then after nuclear bomb test in 1998 US put us in complete export restriction which virtually prohibit us to buy anything high technology equipment or technology (even milligram balance or a 2 nm rough surface is restricted to buy !! then Fab is a far reaching object). That restriction was lifted recently in 2008 after Dr. Manmohan Singh Govt signed nuclear treaty and India is taken out from export control list. But still US and Europe will never sale the whole set of those technology to India as those scientific and technological capabilities is the key reason of spectacular success of western society, high quality of life, thriving economy and military might. They are achieved that through several decades or even centuries of intense scientific thinking and research (starting from era of enlightenment and reason). There is no reason why that need to be shared with a non western third world country (this is a sad truth, but that\u2019s life). So if we ourselves want to have such manufacturing in India then you developed them by yourselves. But unfortunately a) Our Scientist and Engineers from Govt sector or Private sector did not able to develop those key technologies. We don't have any technology to produce \"Silicon Ingot\" ( i,e Silicon Single Crystal) or other materials, the main building block for Semiconductor). As we don\u2019t have technology so we didn't able to develop any full working semiconductor FAB in India. As mentioned earlier those technologies are heavily guarded and restricted by US Govt and Europeans. So even if Indian Govt or private company pay heft sum, nobody will eager to give you those technologies. b) Specially for new generation material for example high speed material like GaAs, (used in mobile component), AlGaAs/AlGaN we even can't even buy those stuff (i,e wafer or technology) as they are completely prohibited under export restricted item even TODAY by US Govt . They can sold to India as a whole product (for example a mobile phone sold in India has GaAs transistor) but you can't buy directly GaAs manufacturing technology or material sitting in India. It is completely prohibited and restricted by US govt.(remember US even does not allowIsrael to buy AlGaAs/AlGaN, so you can understand what will be India\u2019s situation in that respect) History of Indian Semiconductor IC manufacturing: Apart from two Govt company (Semiconductor India Ltd(SCL) and BEL (Bharat Electronics Ltd) there is still virtually nothing exist. During 80's SCL and BEL used to produce ASIC/Transistor using some old technology (licensing) from US company RCA that India Govt got from US Govt. SCL used to make made some ASIC (~ 2 micron), EEPROM etc that they used in ISRO and BEL made some TV/Radio ICs/Transistor/Amplifier /Thyristor/high current switch under RCA license that used mostly in BW and Color Television/Radio and in Indian locomotives/Motor circuit. Recently (~ 2011) Indian Govt negotiated with Tower Semiconductor (Israel) and bought one of their old plant in an attempt to produce some chip (mostly RAM, ASIC) in India. Intel didn't wanted to enter Indian market. Outside US INTEL has only Fab in Israel and Ireland and had not even one in China until recently (in 2011 Dailan proposed but not built) so India's chances are really really slim that Intel will come to India. There is no special reason why India will give any advantage for INTEL to come there and made such huge investment. Whenever you heard something about Semiconductor company/startup in India, it solely based on outsourced software design for integrated circuit/micro controller i,e basically writing code (VHDL, verification etc) and is nothing to do with making any physical semiconductor in Lab. So of course \"Made In India\" is easy to say but in reality except Tower Semiconductor nothing actually practically worked till now. Last I will tell you secret :- whatever the indian government is purchasing weapons from foreign countries like USA Russia israel , never going to works Against them .. because they made them , they know how defend it\u2026 (very easily) If In world war occurs then only major countries like USA ,china ,Israel , Europeans countries like France (biotechnology), UK, Germany, Russia, CAN defend themselves and in that scenario India become doomed & helpless and we're just hoping for miracle. That's bitter truth .. At Last India will open her indian invented weapon KALI to defend themselves.. Government have to fund the money to researcher India have lot of brain but it not get used Current developed countries/regions: **Europe: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, etc.** **Asia: Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Taiwan ROC, Israel.** **America: United States, Canada.** Let\u2019s see what they were like when they witnessed high speed economic growth: **The European countries** became developed in 18th-19th centuries, basing on bloody slave trade, global colonization, oppressing the workers and farmers, no freedom of speech, at that time most European countries didn't have public election. **The United States** completed its capital accumulation in 19th century when its workers had to work 14\u201316 hours a day, and no women had the voting rights. **Japan** became developed in the end 19th century and the beginning of 20th century, during its bloody and oppressed Militarist rule. **South Korea** completed its capital accumulation in 1970s, during Park Chung-Hee the dictator\u2019s oppressing rule. **Singapore** became developed during its rule under the dictatorship of Lee Kuan Yew. **Hong Kong** became developed during British colonization rule, when the people didn\u2019t have any right to vote for the local leader. **Taiwan** became developed under the rule of the dictatorship of Chiang Ching Kuo\u2019s KMT. **Israel** became developed under the regime of David Ben Gurion whose party ruled Israel for more than 30 years. No liberal and democratic system can save a country\u2019s economy, there was no precedents that a democracy like those today could become a developed country. **Because only a centralist and meritocratic system can concentrate national resources on large-scale construction, coordinate overall development, and maintain stable and long-term policy implementation.** All of the developed countries you see today, they first became developed before they became democratic. **Some of these developed countries don\u2019t want other undeveloped countries to become developed, so they advocate others becoming \u201cdemocracies\u201d worldwide.** China using same strategy of dictatorship communist under Powerfull leader **XI JINPING, **thats why China is devoloping and almost devoloped according** **US president Inl repeat No liberal and democratic system can save a country\u2019s economy, there was no precedents that a democracy like those today could become a developed country. **Because only a centralist and meritocratic system can concentrate national resources on large-scale construction, coordinate overall development, and maintain stable and long-term policy implementation.** All of the developed countries you see today, they first became developed before they became democratic. **Some of these developed countries don\u2019t want other undeveloped countries to become developed, so they advocate others becoming \u201cdemocracies\u201d worldwide.** I like to add to your point. The one thing, a very important thing that helped these countries to be developed is war. How is Germany leader of technology? Its because of the war. People were fearing for the Nazi technology. Insecurity from other countries and fear of Germany resulted in the fast forward development in Europe. Why did America land a man on the moon? Its because of cold War between US and Soviet Union. Russia was way ahead in space race by launching Sputnik, world's first satellite. So US made up the mind to land a man on the moon. Its because of compitation and rivalry between China and US, now China is in the verge of being developed country. All a country needs is a vision and a mission and may be a friendly compitation and definitely people's support. You need an optimistic leader to drive the country. *Some** statement is correct upto starting of Civilization to mid 19th century* But as time change revolution changes and needs changes \u2026 **Any concept is not fixed for life time**. It changes from time to time. As economists say, in olden days, when there was no much technology, and agriculture being main occupation, people needed more children. Where as food, resources are surplus. Also due to some epidemic like cholera, etc they used to loose children. Much change now in our ppl, limited to one or two. But some never change as they still believe fools for wicked reasons. But now more ppl means more needs, their future and survival. Today many things are available, what our forefathers dreamed, like good medical services, living conditions, good communication, employment, housing. But not easy for many. Competition. Resources went down. Our stomachs don't know what is technology, it needs only food. \u201cAs technology grows and devoloped by humans itself. Now 1000 Humans work can done by single computer or Industries* are *runed by machines robotic arms \u201c Now More hand , more People \u2260 MORE Money , MORE resource Now More hand more people= less resources , no More money to feed People below Poverty brings MORE children to starvation.. In India when medical facilities provided to people and making pregnancy easier than ever before, they continue use the medical facilities without following it fully.. Following Everything partially **Contraceptive , condoms , Anti pregnancy pill , but they won't follow that because old Religious teaching based on 7th century , when Mother and Childern die in pregnancy..** I know there are a lot of Maulanas, who come almost daily on TV debates and say: \u201c*Bachhe to Allah ki den hain, unka birth control na karein*\u201d (Kids are Allah\u2019s gift, don\u2019t control their births). But when you wouldn\u2019t have enough food to feed them and you will have 4\u20135 kids in your home asking for food, God won\u2019t step down to the earth and feed your children. It\u2019s a human\u2019s own responsibility for the maintenance of his motherland and to do his/her best sustain the resources. Because **God helps those who help themselves**. Some of those Maulanas also say birth control is not allowed in Sharia which is completely stupid. The ones who wanted Islamic rule already went to Pakistan. India was never meant to run on Sharia, then why this? Why can\u2019t we look up to China as an example? They put a ban on making more than one baby for a couple. And also, used their existing large population so well. And the population control law, there, was such a success that now the population has started to decrease on a massive rate and also the government has started to encourage people to build up the population to a decent level. Asking \u201cdo we need such a bill?\u201d is just a waste of time. Instead, protest against the government for not bringing this bill. We should have done that long ago, but now the water is above our heads. It is high time to take action. Also, it has to be unbiased with respect to religions and castes, otherwise it might alter the demography of the country to a large extent. Educated , logicall Europeans understand that term that's why they living good life \u2026. That's why less religious logical People are rich!!! If don't believe me search in Google example:- Pakistan\u2019s debt is rocketing If you look back into history, you will see that none of the countries actually became developed with the democratic form of government. They all developed on dictatorship, autocracy, or slavery. Democracy was adopted by all those country at a very late stage after they have already accumulated wealth from all over the world including from colonization. India has a huge political problem which is the greatest hindrance towards prosperity. You do see GDP numbers and several multinational companies creating employment. But that is not all. There is more to that which is required for a country to grow and prosper **How did Europe develop?** Colonization and wartime loots. **How did the USA develop?** Also refer 2nd answers for MORE info in USA Anonymous's answer to If humans are resources, then why is India not the strongest country of the world? (Someone anonymous's answer to If humans are resources, then why is India not the strongest country of the world?) After WW2 Europe was all in the rubble. They needed manufactured goods to bring their lives back to the track. The USA was the first choice as it had a good infrastructure for manufacturing and also geographically at safe distance from war-torn Europe. The US developed its manufacturing industry as they had whole Europe as a consumer ready to buy. That brought a lot of money to the US. **How did China develop? **After the US became a developed country and its living standard went up, they needed cheaper manufacturing. Enters China. The US became China\u2019s biggest consumer and China made a hell lot of money out of it. China economy skyrocketed. And this was not the only reason. China never had democracy. It was always autocratic. So there was no political mess of multiple political parties creating hurdles in the growth of the country. The communist govt. did what was required to grow the economy and they achieved it. And then China found its new customers all over Asia including India, Africa, and Middle-East. >*The priorities are different. The system of governance is different.* >*For Indians, religion is most important. For ****Chinese, economic growth is important****.* >*We want to build the biggest statue. The want build the biggest dam. We haven't learned from history. They have.* >*Sure the Chinese system of governance might not appeal a European, with limitations on individual freedom. But, that government has brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, through sheer pragmatism, logical planning and perseverance.* >*But, we need not feel bad. Anyway, we will be going to swarga**** / Jannah ****! Rama, Krishna and Shiva ****, Allah , Jesus will**** be there.* **India woke up in 1993, too late**. **Now, we boast India has a huge young population and we are the fastest growing economy. Great! But my question is where is India\u2019s customer outside India? Yes, we have exports but are they really huge enough to turn around India\u2019s economy? China already has so many of its manufactured goods lying around because there are not many customers to buy and so now they are going really bullish to sell in India. By the time India manufacturing sector will become equivalent to what China currently has, most of India will already be using Chineses products and you can see it happening already.** Also, you don\u2019t become a rich country by manufacturing and selling your products to your own country people. You become rich by exporting it and bringing in foreign currency. Yes, with more manufacturing we can save money from our imports but they won\u2019t be enough. I am following India\u2019s politics from the last 15 years very closely. It is a HUGE MESS. It is like crabs in a bucket. One crab wants to move forward, others will pull it back with their claws. One leadership wants to do something good, other political parties won\u2019t let it happen. **Plus the whole mess of religion, caste, language, borders** ( OMG!) that we have is a huge hurdle and it isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. I don\u2019t see India to overcome these issues significantly in the next 100 years. Democracy is a directionless structure. Yes, it does give people the power to control their government but it does not really work for the growth of an underdeveloped country. There will be appeasements, polarization, right and left, vote bank politics, and fall of governments all of which will only slow down the growth significantly. We missed the train and we will suffer and that is a bitter truth. What can be done now? Honestly, I am not smart enough to tell that. There are much smarter people out there who might be thinking about it. However, I can say that the next 100 years are going to be really tough for India. The opportunity to serve United States like they served Europe and become rich and devoloped , so on second line India have to serve United States to accqire wealth from USA . If humans are resources, then why is India not the strongest country of the world? (Someone anonymous's answer to If humans are resources, then why is India not the strongest country of the world?) **This opportunity was taken by china**..** because India woke up in 1993 in globalisation.**",

            "Method 1 of 3:Building Core Strength1. Start in plank pose.The plank not only gives your abs a workout\u2014it's a whole-body experience. If you're starting in plank, lay on the floor on your belly with your palms under your shoulders and your legs extended out behind you. Raise up on an inhale so that your arms are perpendicular to the floor. Your wrists should be directly below your shoulders. Your weight should be evenly supported by your hands and your toes so that you are one long line of energy from the crown of your head to your heels. Tuck your tailbone under and press the front of your thigContinue ReadingMethod 1 of 3:Building Core Strength1. Start in plank pose.The plank not only gives your abs a workout\u2014it's a whole-body experience. If you're starting in plank, lay on the floor on your belly with your palms under your shoulders and your legs extended out behind you. Raise up on an inhale so that your arms are perpendicular to the floor. Your wrists should be directly below your shoulders. Your weight should be evenly supported by your hands and your toes so that you are one long line of energy from the crown of your head to your heels. Tuck your tailbone under and press the front of your thighs toward the ceiling. Gaze out about 6 inches (15 cm) to make sure your neck is not crunched and press your shoulder blades down against your back. Hold this pose for several breaths, then release to the floor. If you find it too difficult to do a full plank, you can drop to your knees for a half plank. Make sure your back is completely flat and not arched. 2. Open into side plank pose.The side plank pose strengthens your entire body, as well as stretching and strengthening your wrists and improving your balance. This balancing pose should not be attempted if you are recovering from a serious wrist, elbow, or shoulder injury. From plank, move to the outside edge of your left foot. Slowly turn your right hip to open toward the right side of your mat so your right leg rolls on top of your left leg, with your right foot on top of your left foot. Turn your torso to your right, lifting your right hand and placing it on your right hip. Balance your body weight so it is evenly distributed between the outside edge of your left foot and your left hand. Your left hand shouldn't be directly below your shoulder but angled a bit. Engage your shoulder muscles to roll your shoulder open. Ensure your shoulder isn\u2019t collapsed into your left arm and leave space between your ear and shoulder. Use your triceps muscle to straighten that arm, pressing into the knuckles of your hand. Your body should be a straight, diagonal line from the crown of your head to your feet. Use your right oblique to lift your hips. Hold the pose for a breath or two, then release and do the other side. If you have difficulty maintaining stability in this pose, you might try doing it with your feet against a wall for more support. Alternatively, you can bring your lower knee down so your calf is perpendicular to your top leg. 3. Stretch with the cobra pose.Cobra pose builds strength in your entire upper body, increasing strength and flexibility in your spine as well as working your chest and abdominal muscles. From plank or side plank, lower to the floor so that you are lying on your stomach with your legs extended behind you. Your toes and the tops of your feet should be on the floor. Place your palms under your shoulders, your arms bent flush along your sides. Pull your elbows back and down and lengthen your neck, touching your chin to the floor. On an inhale, press your hands forward and down, then raise your chest up and back, bending your spine. Keep your chest open, shoulders rolling down your back. Make sure your neck is straight and not crunched. Hold the pose for several breaths, then slowly lower on an exhale. You can create a vinyasa, or flow, with this pose by repeating it 5 or more times, with a breath for each movement. 4. Lower into downward facing dog.Downward facing dog is typically one of the first yoga poses you learn, and is central to many yoga practices. This pose provides stretching and strengthening for your whole body, as can help relieve stress. From upward facing dog, come up onto your hands and knees, with your hands just in front of your shoulders. Spread your palms and fingers out wide. Your knees should be directly under your hips, toes slightly turned under. As you exhale, lift your hips upward, pointing your sitting bones to the ceiling. As you inhale, straighten out your legs (or you can leave them bent if it's more comfortable to do so), keeping your heels off the floor. Your body should look like an inverted \"V\" shape. Stay in a downward facing dog for several breaths. With every inhale, push down through your heels. With every exhale, think of pulling your hips away from the floor toward the ceiling. Make sure your shoulder blades are flat down your back so your shoulders are neutral and your neck isn't crunched. If you want, you can create a vinyasa flow between upward and downward facing dog, a breath for each movement. 5. Transition to chair pose. Chair pose demands tremendous core strength and also helps you gain balance and stability. As you progress with this pose, you'll build the entire core. From wherever you are, come to a standing position and bring your legs together so that the inner sides of your feet are touching. On an exhale, slowly lower your hips as though you are sitting in a chair, keeping your knees squeezed together and over your ankles. Your shins should be perpendicular to the floor. Tuck your pelvis under, lift your chest, and knit the front of your ribcage together. Reach your arms straight out in front of you to counterbalance the weight in your heels, or raise them above your head. Hold the pose for 45 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. If you can't hold the pose and maintain your breath, use a wall for support or don't bend your knees as much. Method 2 of 3:Increasing Core Stamina1. Do a plank vinyasa. If you've done any ab work at all, you probably are familiar with planks. A vinyasa in yoga involves moving between different poses with a breath for each movement to stimulate blood flow and burn fat. Begin in plank position. If a full plank is too difficult for you, modify the position by placing one knee on the floor. Or, come down onto your knees and elbows with your shoulders stacked over your elbows. On an exhale, bend your right knee and tuck your right leg towards your chest. As you inhale, move your right leg back to join the left. Exhale and tuck your left leg the same as you did your right. Inhale return to plank position. Alternate 8 to 20 times, maintaining your breath. Once you finish, you may want to counter by lifting your hips into a downward dog, or you can lower your hips back to sit on your heels and rest in child's pose. 2. Move into a bridge with a lift.The bridge pose builds strength in your core. Lifting in time with your breath adds an aerobic element to this pose. Lie on your back with your legs extended. Bring your knees up so that your feet are flat on the floor, about hip-width apart. Tuck your pelvis under to engage your core and aim to press your lower back into the mat. As you exhale, press your knees toward the back of your mat and press down into your feet. Engage your legs to lift your hips. You can bring your hands together under your body, or keep them at your sides. Lift your chest toward your chin, keeping your shoulders rolled back and down so that your shoulder blades are in line with your spine. Slowly lower your hips as you inhale. On exhale, lift your hips again. Repeat this lift 5 to 10 times, focusing on doing the work of lifting with your core engaged. Engage your core further if you feel pain in your lower back and press your knees toward the back of your mat. If the pain continues, exit the pose. After your repetitions, release and draw your knees into your chest to counter the stretch. You can slowly rock from side to side to massage your spine and lower back. 3. Add some windshield wipers.Windshield wipers really work your obliques, the abdominal muscles running down the side of your body. Doing this twist with a breath for each movement gets your blood flowing to the abdominal region. Start by lying on your back with your legs lifted and your knees bent so that your shins are perpendicular to the floor. Extend your arms out 90 degrees to the side with your palms spread wide, facing down. On an exhale, lower your legs to the right until they are 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) over the floor. Keep your shoulders squarely on the mat and stop if you feel like they\u2019re going to lift up. Inhale and bring your legs back to center. On your next exhale, lower your legs to the left with the same motion. Focus on moving with your core and keeping your shoulders and arms flat. Repeat the motion 10 times, or 5 times on each side. Once you're done, you may want to bring your knees to your chest and rock side to side or up and down to massage your spine. 4. Try the rocking boat. The boat pose by itself strengthens your abdominal muscles, but when you add movement with the rocking boat, the core muscles fire up. Get into boat pose from a seated position. Bend your knees slightly, keeping your feet flat on the floor. Grab the backs of your thighs just below your knees and lean back at about a 45-degree angle. On an exhale, raise your feet off the floor, pressing your feet, legs, and knees together. Your shins should be parallel to the floor. Reach your arms forward at about shoulder height with your palms toward the floor. To start the rocking, tilt your knees first to one side and then to the other. Try to follow your breath for at least 10 repetitions. It doesn't matter whether you start on an inhale or an exhale. You can add a twist by reaching in the opposite direction your \"boat\" is rocking. Method 3 of 3:Reducing Bloat1. Stretch and contract your abs in cat/cow pose. Cat/cow is a relaxing yoga movement that allows you to stretch and contract your entire abdominal region to stimulate your digestive organs. Come onto all fours with your legs directly below your hips and your hands below your shoulders. Your arms and thighs should be perpendicular to the floor. On an inhale, lift your head and your tailbone, pressing your chest forward and arching your back. As you exhale, drop your head and tailbone toward the floor and curve your back upward, like the arching \"Halloween cat\" image. Squeeze your belly in and up. Then inhale and arch upward, exhale drop downward. Do as many repetitions as feel right for you. 2. Stimulate digestion with a seated spinal twist.The seated spinal twist squeezes your digestive tract, which can help relieve gas and bloating. This pose can be especially helpful after you've had a big meal. From a seated position, bend your right knee underneath you as you would in a cross-legged seat. Cross your left foot over so that it's flat on the floor outside your right thigh. You can keep your right leg straight if this is too difficult. Lift with a straight back and begin to turn your upper body to the left. Use your left arm as a guide to keep your spine straight as you set your left hand directly behind your hip on the floor and lift. Lower your right elbow to the outside of your right thigh. With every inhale, think of lengthening your back. With every exhale, try to deepen the twist. Hold this pose for 5 to 8 breaths, then return to center, switch legs, and do the other side. 3. Try the wind-relieving pose.As the name suggests, the wind-relieving pose massages your intestines to help relieve gas and bloating. However, it does more than that, also strengthening your back and abdominal muscles. Start on your back with your legs extended, feet together, and your arms extended on either side. On an exhale, pull your right knee towards your chest or right armpit. Wrap your hands around your knee or your shin and press towards your belly. Inhale. On an exhale, lift your head and chest to look down the midline of your body and try to touch your chin to your right knee. Be careful not to crunch your neck. Release back to the floor as you inhale. You can repeat this 3 to 5 times before switching and doing the other leg. You can also do both legs at the same time. 4. Squeeze out toxins with a supine twist.Twists increase circulation to your abdomen, encouraging better digestion and helping you more quickly eliminate toxins. This gentle twist can be done directly after the wind-relieving pose. If your knees are still bent in towards your chest from the wind-relieving pose, release one leg to the ground and extend it. If you are lying flat on your back with both legs extended, pull your right knee up towards your chest. On an inhale, roll toward the left from your hips, keeping your right arm extended out straight from your shoulder. Try to keep your shoulder blade pinned to the floor, twisting only from your hips. You can place your left hand on the outside of your right knee to deepen the stretch, but don't force it. If necessary or desired, use props to support your right shoulder or right knee. Hold the twist for 10 breath cycles, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. Then, on an exhale, slowly twist back to center. Release your right leg and repeat the twist on the other side.",
