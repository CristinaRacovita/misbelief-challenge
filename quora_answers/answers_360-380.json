            "In the early 70\u2019s, during the Viet Nam War, I was in the Navy and standing in the airport at Norfolk, VA when this guy who looked like Central Casting sent over The Hippie came up to me and spit on me and called me \u201cBaby Killer!!\u201d It took all that I had to not just pound the idiot into the carpet but figured that maybe it would be best not to, you know, prove his point. The best part? I played in the Navy Band. It was my job to play some of the very music that The Hippie grooved to. Sigh \u2026",

            "I\u2019ve personally had two instances where I found the question to be very rude and/or highly insensitive. 25(?) years ago, I had the honor of serving in my unit\u2019s color guard team.

We represented our country and our Marine Corps at Knick\u2019s games in Madison Square Garden, NYC, small local parades and, funeral details. This one time after standing guard by a deceased and highly decorated Warrant Officer\u2019s casket, we hit a small local blue collar biker dive bar somewhere in Long Island or maybe North Jersey. Sorry, was a long time ago. So we\u2019re all decked out in our dress blues having a couple of beers and I go to use the facilities/head/bathroom. A biker walks in after me and asks me what I think of a poster about why we shouldn\u2019t disrespect our colors/flag. Now I got like several thousand things going through my mind like, why did you feel the need to follow me into the bathroom to ask me this, did you want to get my number?, it\u2019s 20\u2032ish years after the Vietnam War, that this guy\u2019s probably not a Veteran, that I\u2019m wearing dress blues so what the fuck do you think I\u2019m going to say, that would he be asking me this question if I was caucasian versus me being Asian?, etc.. I was offended but kept my game face on and looked at him with dead eyes saying, \u201cSir, I think that burning or disrespecting our colors is a terrible terrible thing, Sir!\u201d and walked out thinking What The Actual Fuck!, Lol. Now I live in a very Red State, after escaping The People\u2019s Republic of California after 6 cities over 18 years. The second incident happened a few weeks ago at my home dive bar in Scottsdale. A late twenty-something punk rock\u2019ish \u201crandom\u201d gal was at the bar with her super cute chihuahua mixed pup. I have a weakness for all dogs and had to say hello. So while I\u2019m loving on her dog she sees my KIA memorial bracelet on my right wrist and blurts out, \u201cSo.. Who died on you?\u201d. I maintain my composure reminding myself that this is a counter-culture type and \u201ca kid\u201d, and calmly respond with, \u201cI wear this for my Company Gunnery Sergeant whose main job was as a Fireman with New York\u2019s Bravest\u2026 He was killed at the towers on 9\u201311\u2026\u201d. She responds with, \u201cThat\u2019s cool\u201d. Again, I maintain my composure, grab my drinks and say cute dog, I\u2019ll see you around. Walking away, I\u2019m shaking my head thinking how far she\u2019s Not going to get in life with her issued set of social skills.",
            "Two things really stand out to me as a Combat Veteran in the Marine Corps.Don\u2019t ever ask a Veteran if we killed someone. At the end of the day do you really want to know?

At the end of the day do you really want to know? Do want the know the how, the why, or us to set the scene, or even how many? Most the time we are trying to forget some of those details. Its not that many of us are ashamed of what we have done but you will see things you can not unsee. Asking a Veteran if they ever Killed anyone help you in any way. You wont sleep better at night knowing, you wont get that promotion at work you were seeking by knowing this, you ultimately just end up making must of us want to shut down. We will share with people what we experience when we are ready to, and some never do. The ones who are always willing to tell their stories usually are the ones stretching the truth or elaborating on someone else's story as their own. I\u2019m not saying I have never opened up with non-veteran friends. I have. But its on my terms, and there's not a doubt in my mind other vets feel the same way.I was going to join BUT (random excuse)\u2026\u2026.. I dont care what branch of service we all were in. I have had other branches make the same statements. We all get this from many people some of them friends, some strangers, and it is one of the biggest complaints. It\u2019s almost like the saying \u201cIts the thought that counts!\u201d No, it\u2019s really not. Many have considered it. Few have done it. Please don\u2019t think that we are equals on some level because you once thought about it, or what to try and relate to us. Relate to us on some other level.This also goes for those who served in the any of the other branches, that are not in the Marine Corps. Coming up to a Marine and saying \u201cI was going to joint the Marine Corps but (random excuse)\u2026..\u201d We as Marines especially hate this. It\u2019s not that we dont value what the other branches even have to offer to us as Marines, its not that we don\u2019t value your choice to serve in a different branch(at least you served!), its the fact that they want to relate so badly to us that they are willing to almost be like the civilians making the same statement. I was a 1171 water engineer in the Marine Corps. I did not go infantry. I would never say to an infantry man, I was going to go infantry \u2026\u2026 It\u2019s hard to choose a combat MOS(job) even as a Marine we have people who enlist to be a supply clerk. Its not the same as being a grunt. I went in open contract, I got selected for my job. I never once thought what I did wasnt good enough. I gave it my all and have no regrets. When I choose where to go to school, I didn\u2019t show up at the University saying, well I was going to go to Harvard, but (random excuse)\u2026\u2026 Some people rise up to the challenge some people do it. If you didnt rise up, and we didnt ask have you ever considered it, then dont make the offer of what you once thought about especially if we are not close enough to be on that level where we might even care (Not a stranger) . It\u2019s hard to choose a combat MOS(job) even as a Marine we have people who enlist to be a supply clerk. Its not the same as being a grunt. So in conclusion. The two things you should never say/ask is; 1. Did you ever kill anyone? & 2. \u201cI was going to join but (followed by some pointless random excuse)\u2026\u2026\u201d",
            "I and my wife had just arrived at Miami airport.

It was February 2006 and after 2 weeks of taking her nursing exams that guaranteed her green card and our ability to become permanent US residents, we had flown back to the UK to clean up some loose ends. Arriving back in Mimai was a wonderful experience knowing that this time we weren\u2019t holidaymakers, but here to stay. Then it all went wrong. No, we didn\u2019t take a wrong turn out or Miami airport and end up in a bad neighbourhood. And no, we didn\u2019t run out of gas on Alligator Alley resulting in a night spent in our car being attacked by malevolent mosquitos. We got in the wrong line for customs. We joined the line for UK visitors as we have on the dozens of previous trips over the years to the US. When it became our time to present our passports the customs official saw the visa signifying we were residents. You could have been forgiven for thinking we\u2019d just spat on the flag. There was no smile, no welcome, not even a gentle admonishment for getting it wrong, he just called for a supervisor. What followed had us feeling unsafe not in the sense that we ever feared for our lives, but in a wtf have we done committing to a country that treats its guests like this? kind of way. We were first split up and put into separate rooms. Then, over a 5-hour period of which about 4-hours was staring at blank walls wondering what was going on, we were questioned on why we were there and why we were trying to gain access to the country as a visitor when we were a resident? It was all incredibly intimidating and nerve-wracking. When we were both allowed to leave, again, there were no smiles, no good luck or welcome to the United States, and certainly no apologies, we were simply told we could go. I have no clue who this group below smiling for the camera are. But I suspect if our experience was anything to go by they\u2019re actors brought in because the actual customs and border officials have no clue what smiling even is. And that belief has formed over dozens of trips into the country from overseas not just this one.I have had a handful of other negative experiences coming back into the US at the hands of US Customs. It really is something the US needs to get a handle on because it\u2019s often guests of the United States (who bring billions of dollars into the economy) first point of contact and can leave a nasty taste in the mouth. Having said that, I\u2019m happy to say that was the worst experience I ever experienced in the 15 years of living there. As a whole, Americans are very hospitable and friendly people who made us feel very welcome and contributed to a great period in our life. Edit: I suspected my experience was fairly common because it\u2019s happened to me on a few occasions. I didn\u2019t quite realize how common though until I read the comments. For anybody who has read this and you\u2019re doubtful, I\u2019d say, read the comments too because there are some really good ones. And one thing I can attest to that others have mentioned and I neglected to do so, was that it doesn\u2019t happen in other democratic countries. I have visited over 50 countries and other than once having a problem flying back into the UK for my mums funeral on a passport that literally expired that day (and that was cleared up in under an hour when I explained the circumstances) I cannot remember any issues of any significance.",

I have been to many places in the US in my life. Where have I felt the most unsafe? Two possibilities:New OrleansPhiladelphiaI worked as a consultant for a couple of months in New Orleans in the early \u201890s. While I was there, two people I was working with were attacked. One was mugged at gun point by a guy who jumped out of a van that pulled up beside him. Another was jumped outside a bar by two guys with knives. Having grown up around there, he had learned to fight and made one run off and put the other in the hospital. I was warned by a taxi driver never to approach the police if I needed help. He told me it was not safe and what I must do is stop a cab and the driver would help me/get me out of there. I wanted to enjoy the music New Orleans is famous for, but being a woman (and brown-skinned) was way too afraid to go out by myself. I asked a fellow I was working with if he would go out with me for an evening. He was happy to do so. He told me to come to work that day with \u201cgood shoes for running\u201d. After work, he took me to a shopping mall first. To a gun store. To buy pepper spray. He showed me how to keep the canister upside down in my pocket ready to be deployed instantly. He further instructed me on a few things: he would always walk on the inside, me on the outside, in case someone tried to attack us from an alley. In the case of any attack I was to run away as fast as possible and not look back for him. He would follow. If any group of men approached us I was to cross the street and walk opposite. This was because groups of toughs liked to hassle a man with a woman. He made the whole excursion sound like a journey to the heart of darkness. Fortunately, we had no trouble at all and we had a great time. One day there was a car accident outside the office where I was working. People tried to call 911. All they got was a busy signal. A car was at this point tipped onto its side on the road. A cop on a motor bike arrived to stop traffic. Then the fire department came and hosed down the road. Finally an ambulance came. The firefighters tipped the car back onto its tires. At no point did anyone make any attempt to assist the driver inside. Eventually an ambulance attendant came over and spoke the driver through the window then left. After some time (at least 30 minutes after the car flipped), the driver emerged from the vehicle by herself. She was black. I could not comprehend what I had just seen. Still can\u2019t, really. While I was there a Japanese college student was killed across the river in Baton Rouge when he got the address for a house party wrong. He got no answer at the front door so he want to the side door. When he knocked the owner blew him away through the door with a shotgun. He was not charged. Apparently that\u2019s all good round those parts and the poor student deserved his fate. It was almost an international incident. There were more scary stories but I\u2019ll leave it at that. New Orleans is a place I was happy to leave and will never return to. As for Philadelphia. I was there for a conference in the late \u201880s. I took a cab from the airport to my hotel. The cab driver got lost trying to get to the highway and we wound up in my first (and last) experience of an American slum. Some of the buildings were partially burned. There was plastic sheeting covering the windows and gaping holes in the buildings. People (all black from what I saw) were sitting out on the steps. It was poverty like I have never seen in a US city. The driver (also black) seemed to be in an absolute panic and reversed the car to get out of there. No one threatened us, we weren\u2019t there long, but the driver\u2019s reaction was enough to know the situation was probably quite dangerous. Not to mention very sad. The US has many great places and people and attributes, but the racism and violence are orders of magnitude beyond what Canadians are used to. Most of my visits have been fine but New Orleans was not and Philadelphia gave me a small glimpse of how poorly some people live, even in major cities.",

So much so that I decided not to enroll in the Maths PhD program at the Courant Institute at NYU 2 years in a row! Now my cousin and best friend had gone to Columbia Med School and kept asking me to join Courant so we could share an apartment etc. But I just couldn't bring myself to do it. A couple of years later I was visiting him at Columbia Medical School - right in the middle of Spanish Haarlem. Taking the subway downtown was an ordeal - gangs would block the turnstiles and you'd have to ignore them and walk past. It was the same once in the subway - you'd have to avoid individuals and keep walking from carriage to carriage until you came across people who looked less threatening. Then you settled. I noticed New Yorkers just avoided looking left or right, or anyone in the eye. And of course the unbearable stench of urine on the streets, and worse in the subway. Now to those of you who don't know, Columbia\u2019s main campus is 116th St and Broadway, so middle of Haarlem, while Columbia Presbyterian Hospital is 168th. The main campus is roughly 300 acres or so full of fine buildings. The 168th one is just on the streets. No fine buildings in my view. Rather grim, even if you can catch a glimpse of the George Washington Bridge once safely inside a building. Now my other cousin and very good friend had gone to Columbia as an undergrad to do Electrical Engineering - the main prettier campus - and these 2 cousins would occasionally meet for a bite. But I stayed with my medic cousin in the apartmemt he shared with another medical student - a Stanford grad. One day I returned from a trip downtown and took the subway exit. I had been told which one to take - but I made a mistake and ended up in a place I didn't recognise at all. There were signs in Spanish everywhere. It didn't feel very much like the US anymore but as if I were in South America. No matter, I\u2019d find my way. As I was walking, I noticed groups of young men standing in doorways. They\u2019d say something as I\u2019d pass - always in Spanish, which I didn't speak. I'm just over 6 foot, but they all seemed really short for some reason. This meant I literally stuck out and there was no way of keeping a low profile. The issue was that I had to stop to get my bearings - as soon as I stopped some gang in some doorway would stare and call. And after a while some of them saw me walking back in the other direction on the same street. This got them very interested. Their calls got louder and they started coming towards me. The day was nearly over - it was twilight. And the roads seemed to be deserted, except for these groups of young men in doorways. Finally, I knew I had to stop and get my bearings. I stopped to look at road signs. A gang came from about 20\u201350 yards away and stood next to me as I read the road signs. I ignored them. They kept saying things in Spanish. Then it happened. One spoke to me in broken English. It became clear he wasn't interested in giving me directions. He was about half my size. I sized him up carefully and braced myself. You see just a few years prior, I could hit a cricket ball a long way, throw the ball like a rocket from the outfield, and bowl a decentish bouncer. But I had no cricket bat or ball with me here in NYC. And I\u2019d never done martial arts etc and the whole idea of street combat bored the hell out of me. I braced for impact. I felt confident up to a point - you know the point where you don't care if win or lose. But now more guys from this gang had wandered over - maybe 3, or 6 or 7. My memory is vague now. They started behaving more aggressively. I noticed a couple moving around to the sides and back. I'm not sure why I did it - it wasn\u2019t really a logical decision. I just ran. As fast as I could. My heart pounding - followed by these little guys, still shouting. I knew guns were common - knives didn't scare me for some reason, but I half expected a shot from behind. I'm not sure how long I ran but after a while my lungs just ran out. I had to stop. I now expected to be attacked - with no energy left. And just at that point a man walked across right in front of me. He said \u201cGood Day\u201d or some thing like that and walked into a building. I didn't register. I kept walking very slowly. And it slowly dawned on me, after a few minutes, that I was by the entrance of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. And the man who had greeted me looked like a doctor or academic - who seemed to have got out of a cab. And I possibly likely looked like a medical student to him etc. So just by luck I had ended up running in the right direction and ended up by Presbyterien Hospital and Columbia Med School. And these guys had then given up the chase - there was an invisible line that these his didn't cross. You see on the other side were Columbia U security and patrols\u2026 When I told my cousin the story later that evening he just laughed. But it was no fun matter - apparently someone had been killed in a mugging not many yards away from where my lungs had had enough of my efforts at being Carl Lewis.

Everything looked old and tired and unused. The proprietor seemed like a nice guy, but he did warn me that \u201cwe don\u2019t get too many guests these days\u201d. When I signed the register, I saw I was the first person to check in for nearly 4 months. That is the only time I have ever pushed furniture up against the door before going to sleep. However, I did not get murdered. I got up early the next morning, skipped breakfast, and headed out of town on my merry way."
