Some fans also attribute creative differences and personal conflicts to her presence. It's important to note that opinions on this matter can vary widely among Beatles fans.",

I dislike Yoko because:She has always lied and will continue to lie about how she and John ended up together. The myth that she didn\u2019t know who John was has been so thoroughly debunked, I can\u2019t see why she keeps insisting it\u2019s true.She was instrumental in driving a wedge between John and Paul. Before Yoko came along, John was proud of the work he did as a Beatle and he was happy to call Paul his friend. Once Yoko started whispering in his ear, John turned his back on Paul and the group. You can easily see this when you look at how Allen Klein got his hands on the Beatles. He promised Yoko a big exposition, so Yoko liked him. This meant John wanted Klein too, and that set the ball rolling. I\u2019m quite sure that without Yoko supporting Klein, that part of the Beatles breakup saga would not have happened.She did not break up the Beatles. She did, however, speed up the process. Her presence and interference heightened the already present tensions. It was Yoko who introduced John to heroin and got him addicted, which was one of the defining factors in the breakup. I know people will say it was John\u2019s choice to bring her into the studio. And they\u2019d be right. However, being much older than the Beatles, Yoko should have been the wisest and either told John she wouldn\u2019t go along with it (she could have elected to sit in the control room, for example) or she could have just kept quiet. Instead, she happily offered her opinion when the others didn\u2019t want it, commented on the songs, inserted herself into conversations, and acted atrociously when she didn\u2019t get enough attention. There are tapes of her endlessly screaming and wailing into a microphone when John was talking to the producers and Paul was trying to practice a piano part. Nobody can deny this was detrimental to the group\u2019s dynamics.After the Beatles, Yoko continued to talk negatively about the others, mainly Paul. She wrote most of the lyrics to \u2018How Do You Sleep\u2019 and it was Yoko who said Paul was to John what Salieri was to Mozart. In the final years of John\u2019s life, she purposely kept Paul away from John, intercepting his phone calls whenever she could.I find it grating how Yoko never gives a clear, direct answer to anything. The way she behaves and presents herself is often inappropriate. It\u2019s her prerogative to live her life as if it\u2019s a piece of avant garde art, but when she uses that to draw attention to herself at events that aren\u2019t about her, it\u2019s just rude behaviour.Last but not least: she treated Julian horribly. Not only did she keep him away from John for years (it was May Pang who made sure John would reunite with Julian), she would also tell a 17-year-old boy he couldn\u2019t bring his mother (John\u2019s ex-wife) to John\u2019s funeral, she also didn\u2019t give Julian any of John\u2019s things. Julian had to go to court to get some sort of inheritance and ended up spending most of it just to get some of his father\u2019s things. Paul McCartney also bought many of John\u2019s possessions so Julian could have them. Yoko never wanted him to have anything and she never ever acknowledges Julian. To this day, everything on John Lennon\u2019s social media platforms presents Sean as John\u2019s child. Julian is never mentioned.To me, there are many reasons to dislike Yoko. I didn\u2019t even name all of the objections I have against her\u2026",

Just think if that whole album had been like this:Instead of this:And this:ETA: Some here are blaming dislike for Yoko on misogyny. That\u2019s a hefty accusation, and it deserves to be backed up with some sort of evidence, not merely assumed. Especially when it\u2019s aimed at a group that includes women! Reading through the posts here, I don\u2019t see evidence of that. The reasons given here are pretty consistent and have nothing to do with bias against women. Yoko has indeed been less than honest about her and John\u2019s \u201corigin story\u201d; introduced John to heroin; inserted herself into the recording process against the wishes of the other band members; been less than kind and compassionate toward Julian; was unnecessarily spiteful toward Paul and absurdly dismissive of his work and talent; and grossly overestimated her talent as musician to the detriment of some of John\u2019s recordings and performances. Those are some pretty solid reasons to dislike someone, and none of them have anything to do with Yoko\u2019s gender.",

It has been observed in some areas by researches where if there is a large population of Sharks that if Orcas appear then the sharks mostly avoid them or just swim off and retreat. Yes, one of the oceans' most brutal predators has something to fear. Let's take a look at some stuff that supports this.\" When confronted by orcas, white sharks will immediately vacate their preferred hunting ground and will not return for up to a year, even though the orcas are only passing through,\" said Dr. Salvador Jorgensen, senior research scientist at Monterey Bay Aquarium and lead author of the study.\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/20...085525.htm So this highly suggests that Great whites fear the Orcas and for good reason, because there have been documented cases where Orcas have hunted down and killed Great Whites. Carcasses of five great whites washed ashore in South Africa\u2019s Western Cape Province with sizes ranging from 2.7 meters to around 4.9 meters, and they all had one thing in common, big holes puncturing the muscle wall between the pectoral fins. And the really nasty part is the shark's livers were missing, what could have caused this? What could have butchered one of the ocean's most deadly predators? Those nasty Orcas, of course. A shark that has been attacked and killed by an Orca (images from google) Rest in peace, king fish. It seems to experts that when the Orcas want to kill a shark, they often swim from under, so the sharks don't detect them coming, knocking the sharks on to their backs. While the shark cannot move because of a condition known as tonic immobility, this is a natural state of paralysis which occurs for certain species of shark-like the great white, which is unable to pump water across its gills unless it keeps swimming. A diver showing tonic immobility with a sharkThis is a huge disadvantage when it comes to the sharks. The Orcas then can do pretty much whatever they please. They often remove the shark's liver and eat it\u2026pretty nasty if I say so myself. Or the Orcas will attack as a group, take the shark by surprise, and just play around with the shark until the shark dies of exhaustion. Yeah, it's a pretty hard life if you are a shark when Orcas are around. What experts believe the Orcas are doing to the unfortunate sharksOrcas are apex predators and are using highly specialized hunting strategies to take down the sharks when needed, and the poor sharks just can't compete. Orcas are not picky eaters, however it's not just the Great white that is at risk from the apex predators. Thresher sharks along with Hammerheads Blue sharks basking sharks, and even the Tiger shark are all on the menu. The Orca is also known to prey on baleen whales they have been recorded attempting to try and prey on the mighty sperm whales, the largest species of toothed whale. Yup even the massive Sperm whales have issues with the OrcaYou picked the wrong neighbourhood JawsThe shark looks scared\u2026it should be. In comparison, the Orca is larger and more powerful than the great white shark. Even if we used a large great white shark that is larger than the average white shark, it still would be at a disadvantage to the Orca because the mammal is much more intelligent. They can hunt in organized groups and have a variety of hunting tactics that they use to hunt down a variety of different fish and marine animals like sharks, the Orcas have a varied carnivorous diet. Some information from Wikipedia regarding the Orcas intelligence Killer whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals (after sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring \"intelligence\" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioural strategies are very different from those of humans. A killer whale plays with a ball of ice, soon after a researcher threw a snowball at the whale. Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed. People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:It worked really well for a while. Then the whales split into two groups. It didn't even take them an hour to figure it out. They were so thrilled when they figured out what was going on, that we were playing games. They were breaching by the boats. Craig MatkinOrcas primarily target fish and other marine mammals, but Orcas will eat pretty much any animal they can get their huge and powerful jaws around, even including birds. Penguins have a really, awful time when Orcas decide to show up. There have even been cases where Orcas have hunted down and killed Moose.

But despite being really impressive, it's still not as large as the Orca.

Anyone else hear the Jaws theme playing?Its marine mammals and fish that make up most of the great white's diet. In addition to dining on seal family members including sea lions and elephant seals, the great white preys on dolphins sea turtles, rays and even sharks. It's pretty safe to say that these guys are eating machines. Those poor seals\u2026they never stood a chance.But Orcas\u2026. These guys take it to another level. Oh hey, guys, so you like picking on seals ?? Yeah, you guys are badassOrcas can hunt in organized units, that is a huge advantage over pretty much anything else.

            "Orcas are versatile predators, hunting all sorts of prey in the ocean \u2013 including sharks. However, specific data on orca-shark interactions is very limited. It\u2019s very difficult to observe an aquatic predator. Predations rarely occur at the surface, and extremely rarely when humans happen to be present. So anything that we do observe regarding orca-shark interactions is anecdotal, based on a relative handful of cases. Orcas do eat sharks.

However, specific data on orca-shark interactions is very limited. It\u2019s very difficult to observe an aquatic predator. Predations rarely occur at the surface, and extremely rarely when humans happen to be present. So anything that we do observe regarding orca-shark interactions is anecdotal, based on a relative handful of cases. Orcas do eat sharks. We\u2019ve documented this on numerous occasions: Tiger shark in Costa Rica, seven-gill sharks in Argentina, etc. etc. It should go without saying that sharks are scared of orcas. Of course, most people are interested in the relation between orcas and a very particular shark species\u2026 great whites. For this, we actually do have some useful information. To date, we\u2019ve discovered perhaps a dozen white shark carcasses that likely died from orca predation. Mostly in South Africa. In all cases, the orca ate only the shark\u2019s liver, which is very rich in nutritious fatty acids.Above, white shark carcass discovered in South Africa (2017). Observe the missing liver. Tail section was likely eaten later by scavengers, before the carcass washed ashore. So we know that white sharks are on the menu, and that their livers are delicious to orcas. But we weren\u2019t around when these sharks were killed, so we can\u2019t say how each creature behaved during the encounter. Luckily, there has been one incident where humans actually saw orcas attacking a great white shark. The incident occurred near the Farallon Islands in 1997. Passengers on a whale-watching boat saw a ~5m orca drowning a ~3\u20134m white shark, then leisurely consuming its liver. The ease with which the orca dispatched that shark is remarkable. Both orcas were initially observed hunting fur seals\u2026 and therefore not quite hungry. Then one orca (the smaller one, at that) made a seemingly casual decision to kill an adult white shark and eat its liver. What\u2019s more pertinent (for your question) though is the aftermath of that incident. The attack occurred on October 4th \u2013 which is peak shark season in that area. Researchers typically encounter dozens of different white sharks at the Farallones between October and December, as they fatten up on seals and sea lions before returning to deeper waters in January. But in 1997\u2026 every single shark disappeared following the attack. Observe the chart below, comparing typical shark sightings from 1989\u20131996 (in black) against observations for 1997 (in gray, or missing entirely). Only two sharks were observed between Oct. 4th and December 1st. Meaning that these huge, powerful sharks were driven out of their prime hunting grounds for nearly two months.Again, due to the difficulty of observing aquatic predators, and the murky waters surrounding the Farallones \u2013 it\u2019s entirely possible that sharks remained in the area. But either way, the sharks were not hunting and engaging in normal behavior. They were hiding. Similar situations have occurred in South Africa, where white sharks mostly disappear when there has been a suspected orca predation event. Tour operators from that area have complained quite vocally about it. No white sharks, no tourist money. So, it would appear that sharks have a very simple reaction to orca presence. Get the hell out, and stay away as long as necessary. Even if it means going hungry! It\u2019s likely that sharks can hear the sonar clicks of orcas, although we don\u2019t know for sure. Shark hearing range extends down to 10 kHz, which encompasses the frequency of most orca vocalizations (including sonar). It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if we learn someday that sharks actively avoid the source of such noises. Sidenote: I couldn\u2019t help adding some historical context :-) If we look several million years into the past, the balance of power in the ocean was quite different! Great white sharks today are smaller than their ancestors. Orcas, on the other hand, are much larger. Up until the Pliocene, large sharks terrorized everything in the ocean. Cetaceans were not competitors, they were prey.Some scientists believe that whales\u2019 social behavior developed partly out of predatory pressure from sharks. Better chance of survival if you stick together! But sometime between now and 10 Mya, all of that changed. Dominant mega-sharks such as C. megalodon disappeared. The large sharks that did survive became smaller. This includes the line that yielded modern-day white sharks. Orcas moved into the trophic gap they left behind. They became larger and more powerful, while maintaining the intelligence and social instincts that helped them to survive when they were small and weak. This has led to an amazingly capable species, which has geographically distinct culture and behavioral practices. So we went from a time when sharks ate whales\u2026 to sharks becoming smaller while orcas grew larger\u2026 to today where an orca can basically eat the largest predatory fish at its leisure.",
            "Like the African savannah, the oceans are chock full of animals which are obliged to live among and near each other. Most of the time they either ignore each other or keep a wary eye on and a bit of distance from those which might be dangerous. Indeed, when a lot of predators are attacking, for instance, a big \u201cbait ball\u201d, you\u2019ll likely see dolphins and tuna and sharks and Orcas and Humpbacks all joining in.

If, however, the Orcas appear aggressive or otherwise signal aggression (such as by \u201cpinging\u201d the shark with their sonar - it\u2019s quite noticeable, btw, and sharks would be even more sensitive to it than people), the sharks will generally depart as quickly as possible. Orcas will attack sharks for a variety of reasons - as a danger to the young, as competitors for food, and in order to eat them - or, more accurately, their livers, which tends to be the only thing they will usually eat and most sharks are sufficiently aware of those propensities that they will not hang around if there is any suggestion that the Orcas are aggressive.",
            "if it is a single orca they avoid each other, the point however is that the white shark is a lonely fish while the orcas travel in pods and are able to demolish any living thing in the ocean, it would not surprise me if they dared to attack too sperm whales",

The Tigers have a varied diet and can feast on anything that comes its way, be it, a wild boar, deer/antelope, rodent, bear, bird, rhino, crocodile, buffalo and even their own group of cats like leopards. They even eat fish! A tiger can eat up to 1/2 of its body weight in a single meal\u2026 so basically like all of us during this #quarantine.2. A Tiger\u2019s penis does not erect even when aroused Apparently, a Tiger\u2019s penis doesn\u2019t erect even when aroused and there is a logical reason behind it as an internal extra-skeletal baculum or a penis bone does all the work. It is present in all mammals and primates, drifting at the end of the penis. Baculum results best in sexual procreation, resulting in great advantages to the male by locking the process mid-sex and preventing a female to mate with others before his sperm completely gets absorbed. You must have seen such instances between dogs, think!3. Tigers are the largest amongst other wild cats. You probably knew this that Royal Bengal Tigers are the largest amongst other wild cats but did you also know that the male Tigers weigh up to 300 kilograms. Jezz! That\u2019s like weighing a group of six average human.All they have to do is sit on top of you licking their paws, you\u2019d be dead instantly.4. A punch from a Tiger may kill you It is said that one swipe from a Tiger\u2019s front hand is enough to kill a person or an animal, or at least break one\u2019s bones. uffff!!!5. Tigers are nocturnal animals It is not necessarily true that all Tigers are nocturnal but yes, they do prefer engaging in most of their hunting activities at night.The reason behind this is that Tigers prefer avoiding human conflict during daylight and also patrol around their territory at night. isn\u2019t Interesting ?6. Tiger cubs are born blind and only half of the cubs survive The saddest part is that Tiger cubs are born blind and only a few survive. Literally, the newborn cubs can't see anything, they only follow the scent of their mother. Since they are born blind and can't keep up, most of them die of hunger or cold. Some even get eaten by male Tigers to make the Tigress available for mating. That\u2019s just insane!7. Tigers love to swim and play in the water Unlike the domestic cats, its larger version enjoy spending time in the water and they love to swim for hours. Since cubs, female Tigers encourage or help learn the art of hunting, they even have the ability to kill in the water. And as adults, it is said that they can swim for several kilometres and even have reported one to swim for 30 km in just a day.8. A group of Tigers are called an ambush or streak The Tigers are forced into unnatural situations where they are to share or stay-put under certain areas in a man-made environment, that\u2019s when they are called as ambush or streak, even a Tigress with their cubs is called an ambush.9. Tigers can mate with other big cats Tigers can also mates with other big cats, for example, if a male Tiger mates with female Lion, the hybrid born animal is known as Tigon (Tigon - Wikipedia) They are the largest cat species and can grow bigger than Liger (Liger - Wikipedia) which is a mix breed of male Lion and female Tiger. The height of a Liger is about 4.5 feet while on all four legs and about 6 feet tall when standing.10. Tigers have antiseptic saliva Perhaps, a good side of Tigers is that they have antiseptic saliva, so whenever you get a bruise and want to disinfect them, visit the doctor Tiger, just kidding! Usually what they do is, they tend to lick the area in order to prevent any infection.11. Tigers can sprint at over 60 kilometre/hour Not the fastest runner in the animal kingdom but the fact that Tigers have very strong legs makes them sprint more or less than 60 kilometres per hour, but it is only possible for short distances.12. Tiger stripes are also found on their skin Most of you may not know this but, most of the cat species have stripes on their fur as well as on their skin. It is actually true that similar to human fingerprints, the unique pattern of stripes on Tigers acts like their identity. Even if you shave off the fur of Tigers or house cats, you would still see the stripes.(Note: Please do not try this at home with domestic pets. otherwise i\u2019ll sue you. just kidding) 13. Tigers rarely roar and are humble towards their group I know, by generous, you must be like, what? But just so you know, Tigers are one of the most humble species unlike Lions (no offence). Often it is seen in the wildlife that the male Tigers allow the female and cubs to eat first.14. Tigers urine smells like buttered popcorn Here\u2019s an interesting fact, the smell that emits from Tigers urine smells like buttered popcorn, don\u2019t get tempted because it also signifies a warning sign to the intruders in their territory.Carefully stay away if you ever smell this.15. Tigers prefer to hunt by ambush One of the most common knowledge to any wildlife lovers, wild animals enjoy a surprise kill but not as much as Tigers. Due to their stripe camouflage, they hide behind thick bushes and attack their victim from behind. It is also said that Tigers are less likely to attack when we see them, in fact, most of the villages in India wear a face mask on the back of their head just to trick the Tigers.16. Tigers are solitary creatures It is true, Tigers are considered as solitary animals. Unlike the sights of multiple tigers kept in one cage in the zoos, you are less likely to spot the same age group of tigers roaming together in the wild. Tigers like to stay alone, they are often observed taking a leisure walk all by themselves or perhaps building his strategies for his next meal (LOL).17. Tigers can imitate the call of other animals. Tigers imitate the call of other animals! I had that same expression and it aroused me to dig deeper and found a positive answer, they certainly can. Hunting by mimicry is an added advantage to animals; it has been said that Tigers make a \u2018pook\u2019 sound similar to that of chamois that draws these innocent animals into the trap and get ambushed.18. Tigers do not normally view humans as a prey Tigers tend to attack humans only when they feel threatened unless you look delicious (humour). But on a serious note, we cannot deny that fact, there have been reports on Tigers killing people in rural places, so it is best to stay away from their territory. If you come across such situations, it is best to walk backwards, constantly eyeing the Tiger, as mentioned earlier, as they mostly kill in ambush.19. Tigers cannot purr There are some instances that mention Tigers do purr (occasionally) but this is probably done just for argument sake.Although, Tigers do make other loud noises (not purring). However, other wild cats like Cheetahs and Jaguars can purr but only when they exhale, but if it is an actual purr or something else, the question still remains? In order to show content or calmness, these species tend to close their eyes (even domestic cats) showing their comfort level and a safe feeling.That\u2019s it for now,Quoran\u2019s. I hope you learned something new. I wish you all to roar like a tiger.and also hit this upvote button by your punch(LOL) Thanks 4 reading, Have a good day _/\\_",

There are the following:\u2013 Tigers are by far the most intelligent big cats on earth, and are among the smartest animals alive. Because not only is their brain size 16% bigger than that of lions, but they also adopt strategy when hunting on their own, and learn more skills than their overrated cousins (lions, as pack animals, usually rely on strategy based on teamwork rather than individual intelligence), for the striped cat does study its methods thoroughly when on the hunt, during which it figures out the best way to take down its prey in a very limited amount of time.\u2013 Tigers also display powerful memory, because their short-term memory lasts about thirty times longer than our own, and their memories are made with stronger brain synapses, meaning that they do not forget things as easily as we do.\u2013 Because of their supreme intelligence, tigers are said to be much easier to tame than lions. In fact, some captive individuals are reported to be friendly with both their keepers and strangers, for they greet any human by chuffing and making their world-famous prusten, a non-threatening vocalization that is usually issued to say hello or to signal good intentions.Since tigers are members of the Panthera genus, they do not purr like a domestic cat. Instead, they display happiness by squinting or closing their eyes, since lower vision means lower defense. So, a tiger closing its eyes repeatedly is generally a sign that it\u2019s feeling comfortable.A word of caution, though: tigers remain wild predators that can become unpredictable, so I strongly don\u2019t encourage anyone to go and pet any tiger (no matter how friendly or cute an individual may appear), nor do I support the controversial tiger selfies for that matter.\u2013 A 2010 study revealed that tigers are considered sister species to snow leopards, while lions are more closely related to jaguars. Sure enough, tigers and snow leopards diverged from their ancestral big cats during approximately 3.9 million years ago; the striped cats then evolved into a unique species towards the end of the Pliocene (approximately 3.2 million years ago).\u2013 Throughout its range, a single tiger is capable of taking on 1.7% of all leopards that are found in its territory. Even fully grown crocodiles and bears, as well as packs of wolves and wild dogs, are defenseless against a fully grown tiger \u2013 in fact, tigers almost regularly feed on bears and crocodiles!\u2013 Tigers are far better swimmers than jaguars, because they\u2019re better adapted at propelling their much more muscular bodies and webbed paws through the water. Consequently, tigers can swim up to well over 29 km (18 miles) \u2013 in fact, some individuals have been seen to regularly kill their prey while in the water (see above)!\u2013 The most common tigers are either orange with black stripes, white with black stripes, all albino with no stripes, or golden tabby. But some individuals that inhabit the Similipal reserve of Odisha (eastern India) are found to be black or pseudo-melanistic (see above), meaning they obtain their evenly coats from melanism, just like black panthers.\u2013 A tiger\u2019s roar is far more impressive and intimidating than a lion\u2019s. In fact, it is said that a single growl from a tiger can startle or even paralyze elephants!\u2013 When hunting, tigers don\u2019t mind at all taking risks, since they are naturally blessed with a humongous size, supreme intelligence, deadly bite-force, muscular bodies and powerful forequarters, as well as the biggest canine teeth of any feline alive, the deadliest paw-swipes of any big cat, and the strength of thirteen men!As such, they do kill prey as large as buffalo or gaur (the largest living wild cattle), or any herbivore weighing at around 907 kg, on a regular basis on their own. Truly, no other extant solitary land predator routinely takes on prey this large with ease and regularity.\u2013 Tigers are such versatile beasts, despite their size, that they can and do accomplish a jump of well over 10 meters (32 feet) thanks to their long hind legs. As such, a single tiger can jump on top of an elephant in order to kill it.\u2013 Despite their status as solitary creatures, tigers are actually far more social than their lion cousins. Sure enough, male tigers do participate in raising cubs, and even share their kills with their families without ever fighting them, unlike lions. And sometimes, individuals in Chinese national parks have been seen to come together and form hunting groups.\u2013 Tigers are the only living striped cats, while most felines are either spotted or of one color. Additionally, not only is their fur striped, but their skin is too.The tiger\u2019s vertical black stripes help it break up the outline of its body and make it frantically invisible through the dense foliage.\u2013 Bengal tigers usually inhabit hot tropical areas, such as the jungles of the Indian subcontinent. But in 2010, it has been established that they do inhabit the Himalayas (particularly in Bhutan), in which they adapt extremely well to live at 4,000 meters above sea level, and to survive the harsh conditions there, just like their Siberian counterparts.\u2013 Although wild tigers are still endangered because of poaching, rampant deforestation and conflicts with humans, nevertheless their numbers are currently on the rise, from an estimated 3,200 in 2010 to around 3,890 or even 4,100 in 2016. But there are still challenges ahead, and there\u2019s still a great deal more to do in encouraging conservation efforts, all for the purpose of providing wild tigers and their habitats a better future.So, these are pretty much all unknown facts about the tiger, the creature that I like to call Big Badass Stripes, the true king of the jungle and the most feared of all carnivores. However, if you believe there are more unknown facts, don\u2019t hesitate to let me know in the comments. Cheers and have a wonderful day!",

He was an inbred tiger and his strange facial features show what a price inbreeding can have on animals. His parents were forced to breed again and again until they finally conceived Kenny and his brother, who sadly died quite young. While it is currently up to debate if he truly has down syndrome as info on tiger chromosomes is currently lacking, it isn\u2019t hard to tell this tiger is quite different from the majority of its species. Kenny was a fan favorite at the animal sanctuary he called home because of his friendly personality but he sadly died in 2008. There are also loads of memes about this striped cat. Kenny is a lesson to us. We need to stop inbreeding animals, it just isn\u2019t good for their health.\u201cI have become a meme incarnate.\u201d 2.The perfect BLT You have probably heard the common wizard of Oz quote \u201cLions, tigers and bears oh my!\u201d but what you probably didn't know is that it is actually possible for these three deadly predators to live together, as a family! When I first heard the story of Baloo, Leo and Shere Khan or the BLT, I was truly amazed. The three animals were found together by animal rescuers when they were young. The BLT had suffered terrible injuries from their abusive captor but I won\u2019t describe them here as I find them to be truly cruel. Baloo, Leo and Shere Khan were then moved to Noah\u2019s Ark animals sanctuary were they were found to be inseparable. As a result they were raised together in the same enclosure. The three animals lived happy lives together and even as they got older never came into conflict. Sadly, in 2016 Leo died due to illness but he will always be remembered. So there you have it, not just a fact about tigers but bears and lions as well.\u201cWe dedicate this shrine to are deceased brother, Leo. May he rest in peace.\u201d 3.Tigers have caused the local extinction of wolves. It is no secret that tigers dominate most other predators in their ecosystem but did you know that tigers actually can cause the local extinction of wolves. Siberian tigers have been found to kill wolves, not for the reason of food but to eliminate competition. As a result you will almost never find that wolf and tiger territories overlap. If a tiger enters the land of the wolves they will be quick to leave or die. Interestingly enough, farmers have begun leaving tigers alone as they keep wolves away from their livestock.\u201cThey told me to give up my meal and that I was outnumbered 5\u20131. I told them never tell me the odds!\u201d 4.Tigers are great swimmers Most people know that unlike most cats, tigers like to swim but do you know how skilled they truly are at the task? Tigers can swim rivers as wide as seven kilometers (4.3 miles) across and might swim up to 29 kilometers (18 miles) per day as they patrol their territory. That\u2019s pretty good for a land based predator!\u201cLeaked images reveals the MCU\u2019s newest hero, they call him \u201cTiger Shark\u201d\u201d 5.A tiger\u2019s tongue has a built in comb Like most felines the tongue of a tiger is covered in fleshy bristles that allow it to comb its hair when it washes itself. That\u2019s why these cats have no exuse for having a bad hair day.\u201cDid I hear you say my hair looks bad? I spent all day combing it to perfection!\u201d 6.Tigers hunt and kill Brown bears Living in Canada you grow up believing Grizzly bears are invincible, a pack of wolves the only natural danger for an adult and even they are hardly a threat. Then I heard about the Ussuri brown bear when researching for some answers here on Quora and boy was I in for a surprise! We all know tigers easily dominate predators such as Dholes, Wolves, Leopards and Black bears but when I saw the relationship between Siberian tigers and Ussuri bears, I was amazed. Tigers actually hunt and kill these bears! Ussuri bears make up 1.4% of the Siberian tiger\u2019s diet and generally avoid the feline at all costs. So I think this goes to show why the tiger is one of the world\u2019s top predators.\u201cA bear hug gone wrong.\u201d 7.A tiger\u2019s roar can paralyze prey It is amazing to note that the tiger\u2019s iconic roar can paralyze prey and humans alike. This is a truly frightening skill and the science behind it is even more interesting. Scientists believes it's the low frequencies and high volume that can cause paralysis when the tiger roars.\u201cPetrificus Totalus!\u201d-The great tiger wizard 8.Tiger\u2019s have better manners than lions It\u2019s interesting to note that unlike lions, tigers share their meals. Even though tigers are solitary animals they occasionally come into contact with others of their kind. When this happens male tigers will actually share their food and let the females and cubs eat first. This is an unexpected example of courteous behavior in the animal kingdom as usually males of other animal species possess a threat towards females and young when it is not mating season.\u201cWith this act of kindness they will never associate me with that scumbag lion ever again!!!\u201d 9.The tiger\u2019s urine Tigers always need to know who\u2019s entering their territory, it could be a rival or potential mate. Luckily, tigers have a handy tool, urine! Due to subtleties in the smell of urine tigers can tell the the age ,gender and reproductive condition of other tigers. This way they always know who\u2019s coming their way. Oh and by the way the tiger\u2019s urine smells strangely of buttered popcorn!\u201cFriendship is like peeing on yourself: everyone can see it, but only you get the warm feeling that it brings.\u201d 10.Ligers It is a well known fact that lions and tigers don\u2019t naturally live together but of course somebody bred the two and made hybrid animals! The liger is the mix of a male lion and female tiger. It reaches larger sizes than its parents, making it the largest known feline. All ligers live in captivity and they are known to be less aggressive than the two animals that made them. What\u2019s even more amazing is that the liger was crossbred with a male lion to make a new hybrid, the liliger!\u201cI was told that I was adopted, only later did I discover the truth\u2026.\u201d Hope you enjoyed these ten tiger facts!",
            "If an alligator were to attack a manatee, it is likely that the alligator would attempt to bite the manatee, as alligators are predators and manatees are herbivores. However, manatees are large and have thick, tough skin, which can provide some protection against predators like alligators. Manatees are also generally found in shallow, slow-moving waters, which may make it more difficult for alligators to successfully attack them.

Additionally, manatees are capable of swimming quickly when they need to, and they can use their strong tails to create a powerful burst of speed if they sense danger. In some cases, manatees have been known to swim away from alligators or use their large bodies to block the alligator's access to their vulnerable areas. Overall, the likelihood of an alligator attacking a manatee is relatively low, and manatees are generally able to avoid or escape from predators. However, these interactions do occur in nature, and it is important to remember that alligators are wild animals and should be respected and given a wide berth to avoid any potential conflicts.",

So is the Victoria Desert in the interior of Australia, as well as much of the Mexican-US borderlands. Due to the way the rotation of the Earth affects pressure cells and the highest concentration of intercepted solar radiation, there is a belt of deserts\u2014both north and south of the equator\u2014 centered at the 30 degrees latitude. The extreme cold air over Antarctica limits moisture holding capacity. Furthermore, the nature of currents around the continent inhibit rain from being carried in by the wind. This has actually led to a Southern Ocean coming into recognition. Other big desert areas occur due to rain shadows in big continental interiors, such as western North America and central Asia. The propensity of greater landmasses with sheltered interior landmasses as well as the vast majority of the Earth\u2019s dryland near thirty degrees latitude being in the northern hemisphere are the reasons why the far greater amount of deserts being in the northern hemisphere, even though Antarctica in in the southern hemisphere.

There was a very minor debate in Columbus' time  but that was not about whether it was round, but how big it was.  And in that debate Columbus happened to be dead wrong.  Luckily for him, when he sailed west using his incorrect calculations he just happened to hit the Caribbean before he ran out of supplies. A Medieval depiction of the earth as a sphere The fact is, the Church did not teach that the earth was flat at any time in the Middle  Ages.  Medieval scholars were well aware of the scientific arguments of  the Greeks that proved the earth was round, thanks to their knowledge of Plato's Timaeus, which shaped their views of the cosmos, and later their use of Ptolemy and Arabic astronomers. And they could use scientific  instruments, like the astrolabe, to accurately measure its  circumference.  The standard text on astronomy used in medieval universities from the later Thirteenth Century was John Sacrobosco's De sphaera mundi - \"the Sphere of the World\". The fact that the earth is a sphere was so well known,  widely accepted and unremarkable that when Thomas Aquinas wanted to  choose an objective fact that is not able to be disputed early in his Summa Theologica he chose the fact that the earth is round as his example. And  it was not only the learned who knew the shape of the earth - all  evidence indicates that this was commonly understood by everyone.  A  symbol of the earthly power of kings, used in their coronations, was the  orb: a golden sphere held in the king's left hand to represent the  earth.  That symbolism would not make sense if it was not understood  that the earth was round.  A collection of German sermons for parish  priests from the Thirteenth Century also mentions, in passing, that the  earth was \"round like a apple\" with the expectation that the peasants  hearing the sermon already understood what this meant.  And the popular  Fourteenth Century English book of travellers' tales, The Tales of Sir John Mandeville,  tells of a man who travelled so far east that he returned to his  homeland from the west, while not explaining to its audience how this  works.  The  popular idea that Christopher Columbus discovered the earth was round  and that his voyage was opposed by the Church is a modern myth created  in 1828.  The novelist Washington Irving was commissioned to write a  biography of Columbus, with the brief that he depict Columbus as a  radical thinker who turned his back on the superstitions of the old  world.  Unfortunately Irving found that Columbus was actually wildly  wrong about the size of the earth and discovered America by pure  chance.  Since this did not make a very heroic story, he invented the  idea that the Medieval Church taught the earth was flat and created this  persistent myth when his book became a best-seller. The fact that many people (including some of the poorly supported, assertion-laden answers to this question) continue to believe in the myth that people in the Middle Ages were taught the earth was flat shows how pernicious this kind of tendentious myth can be.",
            "Most educated Europeans were well aware that the world was round.  The question was whether it was feasible to sail west from Europe and reach the Far East. Columbus belived it was, on the basis of a low estimate of the size of the Earth and an overestimate of the size of Asia.  On the basis of the correct figures, he had no hope of reaching Asia.  He was lucky enough to find new and unexpected lands in between.",
            "As Tim O'Neill and others have explained here, at no point during the European Middle Ages did a significant number of educated Christians doubt the sphericity of the Earth.  Medieval Christian philosophy held Aristotle in the highest esteem, and Aristotle had offered three good arguments for believing the Earth to be spherical in his treatise On the Heavens.

Medieval Christian philosophy held Aristotle in the highest esteem, and Aristotle had offered three good arguments for believing the Earth to be spherical in his treatise On the Heavens.   The ancient Greek astronomers Eratosthenes and Posidonius had come up with correct ways of estimating the size of the spherical Earth.  And medieval geography and astronomy were largely based on Ptolemy, who understood the Earth to be spherical. The notion that medieval Christianity rejected the sphericity of the Earth on scriptural grounds is largely based on just two authors: Lactantius, tutor to Emperor Constantine's son Crispus in the 4th century, and Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th century Byzantine sailor turned monk.  Their views on the shape of the Earth derived from a literalist interpretation of the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament) and from their rejection of classical \"pagan\" learning.  It is generally accepted now that the ancient Hebrews did have a flat-Earth cosmology, reflected in some biblical passages, but neither Lactantius (who was pre-Medieval and later came to be regarded as heretical by the Church authorities on other grounds) nor Cosmas can be considered as representative of the mainstream Christian thinking of any period, as some 19th-century commentators tried to present them. What genuinely influential Christian thinkers like Saint Augustine of Hippo explicitly denied was the possibility that the regions of the Earth diametrically opposite to Europe (the \"antipodes\") might have human inhabitants.  It seems to have struck these theologians as particularly absurd and scandalous that people living there would have their feet pointing upwards!  Moreover, it seemed difficult to reconcile the human settlement of an antipodal region with the biblical account of history.  See: NPNF1-02. St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine. According to Christopher Columbus's son Ferdinand, the old Christian arguments against the antipodal regions being inhabited played some role in the opposition to Columbus's project of reaching Asia by sailing westward.  However, the key points on which Colombus disagreed with the leading scholars of the 15th century were: the size of the Earth,the size of the Asiatic continent, andthe size and location of Japan and other islands to the east of mainland Asia.On all of these points Columbus turned out to be wrong.  The details of this are well explained in the relevant section of Wikipedia's biography of Columbus.  What I find fascinating is that Colombus was actually the quintessential crackpot.  He had little formal education, but he read avidly and developed his own unconventional ideas, against not only established authority but also rational evidence.  And he was unshakably convinced that God had appointed him to accomplish extraordinary things.  Yet, unlike the vast majority of crackpots, by refusing to listen to reason he actually achieved immortality! By picking the smallest of all estimates for the size of the Earth (obtained in part by a confusion about different units of length) and the largest of all the estimates for the extent of continental Asia, and by buying into the idea that there were several large, inhabited islands to the east of continental Asia (including the phantom \"Antillia\" just to the west of the Azores) Colombus made a case that the westward trip to Asia was possible with the navigational technology of the time.  His estimate of the length of the voyage from the Canary Islands to Japan was too small by a factor of more than three! The scholars of the time reasonably concluded that Columbus's project was unfeasible.  In the end, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain signed Capitulations of Santa Fe and gave Colombus what he asked for because they decided that the investment was minimal and that the far-fetched possibility that Columbus might actually reach Asia and return would carry a great reward for them. One interesting tidbit is that, far from being the heroic discoverer of the Earth's sphericity into which he was later made by popular writers like Washington Irving, during his third voyage Colombus actually misinterpreted the diurnal rotation of the pole star as evidence that he was approaching the Garden of Eden, where the Earth bulged out like a pear.\u200bColumbus's pear-shaped Earth, from W. F. Warren, Paradise Found (1885)Colombus was a piece of work.  Installed as governor of the new Spanish settlements in the island of Hispaniola, he proved a cruel and incompetent administrator and had to be removed and returned to Spain in chains.  The Spanish monarchs finally allowed him to return to America, but never again as governor. Back in Spain, Colombus devoted his energies to composing two tomes: a Book of Privileges, which detailed the rewards that he thought were owed to him and to his descendants, and the bizarre Book of Prophecies, in which he intepreted his voyages in the context of the fulfillment of Biblical prophecies about the End of Times.  He died without ever acknowledging that he had failed to reach Asia. One of the main sources for historians of the period are the documents pertaining to the lawsuits (the pleitos colombinos) that Colombus and his descendants brought against the Spanish Crown for having reneged on the terms of the Capitulations of Santa Fe, which the monarchs felt they were no longer bound by after Columbus had been arrested and removed as governor.  The last of those suits ended in the late 18th century! Columbus did have some good qualities, beyond his fearlessness and tenacity.  He was a skilled practical navigator, and he had some knowledge of the wind patterns in the Atlantic (see Volta do mar), which allowed him to travel to the Caribbean and back with the sailing technologies of the day.",
            "He knew that the world was round, of course, but he used a value for its size that was about 1/3 of the actual size. And, of course, when he struck land, he got convinced that he was right, and there was a bit of a commotion for a while. It fell to a later cartographer, Amerigo Vespucci, to sort it out. He got a couple of continents named for him, which is a bit of an achievement.",

That one really upsets me. The fact a \u201cflat earth\u201d level of nonsense like this can remain so popular is a testimony to the fact denazification was never seriously implemented. Here goes:\u201cHitler banned animal testing\u201dAnimal testing was as common in Nazi Germany as it was elsewhere (1) (2). Defenders of animals rights, and environmental associations were all dissolved under the Nazi regime for \u201cdeviancy\u201d (3). Now let's move to one animal species in particular: homo sapiens. Scientifical experiments on live specimens[1] . Mass-sterilization, genocide, starvation, forced labor until death from exhaustion, deliveries of cheap \u201chuman resources\u201d[2](4) for the industry, use of \u201chuman resources\u201d (menschematerial) as raw material to produce chemicals, soap, even skins\u2026 Last but not least, our hippie Nazis went on a crusade against \u201cJewish bacterias\u201d, which they genuinely deemed non-human animals. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it. So, in their own referential, this constitutes cruelty towards animals. But hey, Hitler loved his dogs, right?Hitler protected natureHeavy industry, but especially chemical industries or synthetic oil production, were booming under his rule[3]. Huge tracts of lands were replaced by autobahns. Environmental regulations vanished[4]. So much so that it was commonplace for British, American, French industrials in the 30\u2019s to praise it: \u201cat least in Germany we can do business [unimpeded by regulations]\u201d.Hitler cared about ecological systemsThat one is true. He literally wanted to carve a \u201cbiotope\u201d (lebensraum) for the German animal race. He cared A LOT about living space. But to exploit it, loot it like if there\u2019s no tomorrow. Nazis understood ecological systems as a zero-sum game[5]: eat or be eaten. Exploit or be exploited. Vampirize, loot, extinguish, or lose your \u201cvital forces\u201d[6]. They pushed the exploitation of nature to paroxystic levels. Note that they weren't the only ones. The dust bowl in the US, the Aral Sea mismanagement in the USSR\u2026 are also testimonies of that era.Hitler was pro-veganHitler was crippled with many health issues, including a spectacularly irritable bowel. Which is why medical doctors advised him to stay away from meat. Which he did. That, we can put to his credit. But was he promoting veganism? No. Meat sources for the German race were protected at all costs, which is one of the single victories his regime achieved: as opposed to 1918, the Germans ended this round without losing any weight. At the expense of everyone else in Europe, granted. But everyone else was more or less animals, and animals are expendable, so\u2026Okay, but\u2026 they were rational! Germans are rationals!Germans? That's debatable. Nazis? Not so much, no. They considered half of modern science as \u201cJewish science\u201d and banned it. Including the nascent ecology. They applauded the Atlantropa project[7] (to dam the Gibraltar straight) to \u201ccreate more farmlands\u201d, while any decent agronomist could foresee it would have turned the Mediterranean basin into a toxic salt desert of epic proportions, and contaminated half of Europe fertile lands with it. Lastly, and my favorite:Hitler wanted to ban cigarettes for health reasonsHe really disliked smokers, yes. Was it for health reasons? No: it was because it renders the \u201chuman resources\u201d unproductives. Same reasoning with alcohol, oversleeping, laziness etc\u2026 meanwhile Hitler himself was a deeply \u201cunproductive\u201d individual by his own metrics, something abundantly commented. He overslept, was unable to concentrate, preferred lunatic ramblings about roman architecture rather than actual conversations, and his laziness was a popular topic behind his back. Alcoholism, meanwhile, was deemed a mental disorder rewarded with work reeducation. Ironic. On the other hand, any addiction making the human resource more productive was perfectly okay, encouraged, laced in chocolates, given to children. Like amphetamines, which quickly became a public health issue hindering the war effort. Long story short, it was never about health. On the other hand, perhaps you see a pattern emerging. It was all about exploitation of the body, of animals (a category including most of mankind), of raw materials, of Nature. There was nothing \u201cgreen\u201d, \u201cecological\u201d in their program. Sadly the average YouTuber seems incapable of gathering actual sources. So loads and loads of disinformation, mindless regurgitating, and the \u201chad he calmed down in 1938 he would be a hero\u201d narrative continues to spread. Had he calmed down in 1938: workers, minorities, and \u201casocials\u201d were already dying gruesome deaths as slaves for IG Farben profits. Unfit \u201canimals\u201d already euthanasied.

Ice, on the other hand, preserves things, delivering an eternal source of punishment for the lost souls. If you ever tried to immerse your hand in icy water, you are aware of how painful it can become, fairly rapidly. But this is not a lesson in physics, only a literary interpretation and our imagination should be free to leap over our rational mind. What caused the river to freeze? A very cold and strong wind, generated by the movement of Lucifer\u2019s wings.If you look carefully, Lucifer has three faces, which unites at the top of the cranium, symbol of pride. Different interpretations have been given during the centuries: for some, Satan needs to be able to survey his kingdom in all directions. The faces have also different colors: vermilion, pale/yellow and black. These may represent the three land masses known at the time: Europe, Middle East/Asia and Africa. In Dante\u2019s presence, Lucifer is also gnawing on three sinners: Judas, Brutus and Cassius. With the help of Virgil, while timing his actions with the rhythm of the Devil\u2019s wing, Dante will climb down his chest into the middle of the earth.

That\u2019s not meant to be a criticism. To say Da Vinci is anything beyond one of the greatest artist in history is disingenuous and hyperbolic. I have studied Da Vinci when I studied art history. I like the guy enough. But just like his most famous and most over-hyped masterpiece, the painter of Mona Lisa is also one of the most over-hyped artists in history. People look at his drawing of fantasy anatomy, fantasy war machines, fantasy everything else, they think he's not only a fantasy artist, he's also a scientist and engineer. He wasn't. He thought he was. That probably helped feed the hype. When Lorenzo de Medici introduced Da Vinci to the Duke of Milan, he wrote: I introduce to you the best lute player in Italy. And when Da Vinci introduced himself to the Duke of Milan, he consider himself a military engineer. And despite being a complete autodidact and being perceived by the society as a lowly craftsman, he wanted people to see him as a wise intellectual.He's quite handsome, you know.Verrocchio\u2019s David\u2019s face was said to modeled after young Leonardo. But most people remembered him as a wise old learned scholar. He created his own image, the person he wanted to be, and we swallow it whole and perpetuating it 500 years later.

This is going to be a long read, grab your favourite beverage and sit comfortably :) Now let\u2019s imagine our brain as a car. This car has 4 drivers. Only one driver can drive the car at a time while other drivers can influence the driving. At any point, any of the 4 drivers can pick up the steering wheel and start driving the car. Meet your 4 drivers:SurvivalTrustMotivationImagination## Survival Your survival driver is responsible for 3 key tasks:FightFlightFreezeSurvival driver is activated in life threatening situations (ex: car about to hit you) and in modern times, stress can activate it; then what we have is:Fight: AggressivenessFlight: AnxietyFreeze: HelplessnessWhat does this mean? When you see someone who gets angry easily or anxious or feeling down, their survival brain is now driving them. There is no use trying to reason with people being driven by their survival brain, everything is a threat to them at that point. We need to bring the person out of the survival:If aggresive, go with the flow while remaining calmIf anxious, offer optionsIf helpless, give supportYour survival driver usually needs to go through logic before activating but if it gets activated often (ex: constant stress from work) then it's constantly active. At this point the person affected will easily get aggressive, anxious or helpless without a real threat. The solution to this is to calm down your survival driver by constant meditation and being in a soothing environment - do not use drugs to calm yourself down as that will only make things worse in the long run. ## Trust Your trust driver is interesting because it defines your position within a social group and works on 2 main areas within 4 axis: Areas:Self confidence (Trust in yourself)Trust in othersAxis:X axis for self confidence (trust in yourself) and Y axis for trust in others You want to be in the centre - assertive, confident and not worried about your actions. We usually shift around the graph depending on where we are and who we are with. Each axis has 5 levels or stages we go through, 1 being the first and least hurtful stage and 5 being the last and worst. Levels 1\u20133 are treatable by yourself or with a close friend or family, if you reach levels 4-5 then it\u2019s recommended you seek professional help. When you have too much self confidence, you become dominant and it goes through the following stages:Flattery and seductionManipulationMockeryIntimidationSadism and crueltyWhen things go well for the dominant, they believe it\u2019s their doing. When things go wrong, it\u2019s someone elses fault. If you know anyone that acts super charming and nice to people while they use them as a utility to obtain what they want, they have reached the top of dominance and need help. When you have too little self confidence, you become submissive and it goes through the following stages:Perfectionism and tendency to want to believe people too easilyExcessive willingness to serve or please othersFear of breaking rulesPanic attacks and guiltHurting yourself and suicideWhen things go well for the submissive, they believe they got lucky. When things go wrong, they believe it\u2019s their fault. If you know anyone that cuts themselves, they have reached the bottom of self confidence and need help - extreme submissiveness will lead to depression and suicide. Now we will talk about going left/right in the trust in others axis. If you have too much trust in others, you reach axiality and it goes through the following stages:You are okay with sharing information with others and strangersYou see hidden meaningsYou communicate without wordsYou communicate with thingsYou become gullibleIn extreme case, the person gets used by people regularly and needs help. If you have too little trust in others, you reach marginality and it goes through the following stages:Uneasiness at sharingLoss of contactLoss of connectionSense of exclusionConspiracy - you believe people are plotting against youIn an extreme case, this turns into paranoia and the person needs help. Some things to note about the trust driver:It takes a lot of time to grow, you cannot get more confident easily.While you can easily lose your confidence and trust when you have a traumatic event.When active, we can see territorial or power plays and the person does not question their own behaviour and so never learns - they need guidanceThe good part, it only lasts for a short time each time it\u2019s activated.So if someone is acting intimidating, give them a bit of time and firm resistance and they will back off on their own.## Motivation Your motivation driver stores your deepest motivations and raw emotions as well as your memories (the good, the bad and the ugly) Most of the time motivation driver is what\u2019s driving you around by running on autopilot by recognising situations you have been in and uses the standard operating procedure you teach it. Your motivation driver knows everything you have ever learnt! This driver is super efficient because it uses the minimum attention span to carry out tasks, allowing us to do more than 2 things at once. For example when you are driving a car and talking to your friend passenger at the same time, your motivation driver is in control. This driver has 3 layers of motivation:Intrinsic: This is your fixed motivations that will never change and is partly formed by genetics and partly by your environment as a babyThis is why some things you do gives you energy and makes you happy even if you are not exactly good at it (ex: drawing) because it\u2019s an intrinsic motivation of yours. This is also why some people can get extremely good at certain things (ex: drawing) since it\u2019s an intrinsic motivation that keeps them happy and working on until they master it. The sweet spot is finding your intrinsic motivations and making a career out of it, then you are getting paid to do what you truly love to do and which actually makes you happy. 2. Extrinsic: This is dynamic and keeps changing depending on your environment and trends, it stores what you currently like and dislike. Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion) The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3\u20136 months. 3. Obsessions: When things you like stay in your extrinsic long enough, they become deeply rooted in the 3rd layer and become obsessions. This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff. When it\u2019s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession. # Imagination: This is the marvel of evolution, it\u2019s what makes us human. Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation. It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box. People usually don\u2019t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations. Examples:Atari and HP turning down Steve Job\u2019s ideasIBM believing there is no market for PCsThese mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw. When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control. How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Why am I feeling like this?What am I basing this decision on?How can we do this differently? how can we do it better?Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver. In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life. Hope this helps you as much as it helped me. I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated. All the best!",

The number of stars in Milky Way is approximately around 200-400 billion. Surprisingly, there is difference in neuronal number in the right and left cerebral hemispheres. It is estimated that there are 186 million MORE neurons on left side than right side.Additionally, glial (non-neuronal) cells accounts for almost 80% of the cells in the human brain. Though, there is a controversy of 1:1 or 10: 1 glia: neuron ratio, it is clear that glia outnumber neurons (probably 10-50 times).",

There are several layers to the mammalian brain cortex:Different types of pyramidal neurons are found in each of the layers, as shown in the following diagram from a review article in the journal Nature [1].  Figure 1 | Pyramidal-neuron structure and domains of synaptic input. a | The structures of pyramidal neurons from different cortical areas. Each type of pyramidal neuron has basal and apical dendrites and an apical tuft, but there are considerable differences between the pyramidal neurons shown. Layer V pyramidal neurons have longer apical dendrites and fewer oblique apical dendrites than layer II/III pyramidal neurons. The apical dendrites of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons branch closer to the soma than those of CA1 pyramidal neurons, which typically have a more distinctive main apical dendrite and tuft. CA3 pyramidal neurons also have a cluster of large spines in the first 100\u03bcm of the apical dendrite. The full vertical length of each cell, from left to right, is: unknown; 1,180\u03bcm; 580\u03bcm; 730\u03bcm; 790\u03bcm. All cells are from the rat, except for the layer II/III cell, which is from the rabbit. b | The apical tuft (highlighted with a purple background) of pyramidal neurons receives excitatory synaptic inputs that have different presynaptic origins to those that form synapses onto more proximal apical dendrites or basal dendrites (highlighted by a green background). The basal and proximal apical dendrites of layer II/III cells receive inputs from layer IV cells and also receive local-circuit excitation. The apical tuft of layer II/III cells receives inputs from other cortical areas and also receives nonspecific thalamic inputs. A similar arrangement can be identified in layer V pyramidal cells. The basal and proximal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells receive input primarily from CA3 cells, whereas the apical tuft receives input from the entorhinal cortex and the thalamic nucleus reuniens. c | A schematic drawing of a pyramidal neuron, illustrating various dendritic domains that could receive unique synaptic inputs. Some evidence supports the division of pyramidal cell dendritic trees into at least this many domains, which correspond to regions that receive distinct synaptic inputs and/or have synapses with distinct properties (see main text). If you're interested in learning further, please refer to the article for an accessible and comprehensive guide to what pyramidal neurons do, what we know about them, and what we still have to discover.

Forcing interaction is never a good thing.Some people no matter how much you love them will not return that love. Learn from the experience and go on with your life.Most people are not thankful or notice what you do for them until you stop doing things for them.The people that matter have stuck by you in your darkest of times.The partner that is in it for the long haul will always try to work things through no matter how painful or difficult it is.Always match their effort. If they are attentive be attentive, if they are barely there then you do the same.If someone only wants to text you online and never makes any plans to see you. Know this this is all the relationship will ever be. You\u2019re a time filler and you are not the only one they text. If you are looking for something more, move on. Unless it is physically impossible to see them face to face or for some other extenuating circumstance.Do not let anyone waste your time. Once time is gone it's gone forever.Leave the past in the past, people change sometimes drastically over the years. In other words do not think the person you knew then is the same person now.Pay attention to more of what a person does than says. Words are just that words and at times have little to do with the facts of what is really happening.Never base a relationship on what ifs. Look at the interaction for what it really is now. It may never move past this point.When someone tells you they do not want a relationship, believe them. If a relationship is what you are looking for then move on. This person for whatever reason is not open to it right now or ever. If you stay know that more than likely you will be disappointed, hurt, and never satisfied.You cannot love anyone if you do not love yourself. Meaning do not do anything for someone you would not do for yourself first. Its OK to have boundaries in any relationship.Somethings are better left unsaid. Not everyone appreciates brutal honesty, especially if it's going to crush them or cause an emotional upheaval. Always think it through first. Speak in a tactful way and never deliberately hurt someone. You can never take back what has been said.People will always be the best they will ever be to you in the beginning. So if someone is treating you like shit it\u2019s only going to go downhill from there.If there is no attraction the it\u2019s not going to work in a romantic relationship. I am not saying it is based solely on looks either. What I am saying is there has to be something about them that you find appealing enough to transition from friends to lovers.People are going to hurt you in some form at some point in your life.

This organization co-founded green peace and several other international organizations that Maurice Strong was associated with. While the left believes they're bringing about positive change for the world, they're actually being used as a social and political arm in the aims of creating a New World Order the globalist want in place by 2030.

I'm not sure that these incoherent fantasies could be called a theory, but the Guardian's Tom McCarthy\u2019s use of \u201cinteractive far-right fan fiction\u201d seems apt. Gary Tuchman of CNN interviewed some QAnon enthusiasts at a Trump rally. The people interviewed seemed earnest and compus mentus, despite having some rather odd ideas. These are respectable working class citizens, which makes their extreme views all the more surprising. We are Q A young man holds up a red, white and blue Q, proudly proclaiming \u201cWe are Q!\u201d One nice lady accompanied by a friend says \u201cQAnon are the people who believe in what Trump's trying to do to change our country.\u201d Another lady wearing a stylish T-shirt with The Storm Is Here, Q Anon explains that Q is \u201can entity of ten or less people that have high, you know, security clearance\u2026I'm just telling you this is what it appears to be.\u201d When Tuchman says that she doesn't have any proof of that, she says \u201cyou don't have any proof there isn't.\u201d The QAnon community clearly want to believe, and use somewhat warped reasoning to continue doing so. A lady wearing a WWG 1 WGA (where we go one, we go all) shirt explains \u201cwe've all been gathering online together as Americans uniting\u201d and goes on to say \u201cthere hasn't been any non-evidence yet.\u201d She says of the Deep State running the country \u201cI think they were, and they're petrified now because they're losing their control\u201d and that Donald Trump is \u201chaving to fight against the Deep State\u201d and \u201cI think he's been fighting since before he was elected.\u201d This lady believes that the Clintons, the Bush's, and the Obama's are part of the Deep State, and are trying to run the country. One man responds to being asked if it's possible he believes in bogus information by looking into the camera and addressing Q, \u201cI mean, let's see, let's see Q, let's see.\u201d A man in a Proud American T-shirt says to Tuchman \u201cyou guys have been totally weaponised by the CIA.\u201d This was a polite young man, but his words sum up the attitude of many hard-core Trump supporters to the media, and are a noteworthy if distorted reflection of Trump's own words. The QAnon believers appear to have one thing in common with many of the US electorate. That is, a conviction that they have been let down by previous Presidents, including Obama, and that US interests have been betrayed by a corrupt elite. Calm Before the Storm Q emerged on 28th October 2017, on the 4chan message board. The first thread was titled Calm Before the Storm. In this and subsequent posts Q established himself as a government insider who knows the truth about a secret struggle for power. Q dropped \u2018breadcrumbs\u2019 on 4chan before moving to 8chan, which the QAnon \u2018bakers' are devoted to decoding. It's difficult to say exactly what the basic tenets are, as ideas and theories vary and change, but a preoccupation with fascist ideas and religious apocalyptic scenarios is evident. This is a summary of some of the beliefs expressed by believers:A mysterious person, or small group of people, known as Q are fighting against the \u2018Deep State\u2019.The Deep State includes all recent past presidents, Hillary Clinton, and George Soros, and other senior officials.The Deep State have hatched a plot to start wars and are planning a coup, as well trafficking drugs and taking part in an international child-sex trafficking ring.The Mueller investigation is a counter-coup led by Trump. He pretended to collude with Russia so that he could hire Robert Mueller, a \u201cwhite hat\u201d who is secretly investigating the Democrats. (1)Trump is heroically fighting global paedophile networks amongst the elite, which includes certain Hollywood celebrities.Trump gives secret signs by forming the letter Q with his hands. He also sends coded messages in his tweets, for example by using the letter Q, and by the length of time between tweets. The number 17, representing Q, the seventeenth letter of the alphabet, also has special meaning.Trump has teamed up with virtuous world leaders such as Kim Jong Un and Putin, as well as the military, to take on a global cabal of Democrats, the Hollywood elite, and bankers who are responsible for all evils in the world. Soon Trump will have these people arrested. Early messages predicted mass riots, others fleeing the US, and military occupation with martial law. (2)The Great Awakening. It's hard to interpret the deliberately gnomic messages of \u2018Q' and the believers, but this seems to be the point at which believers decipher Q's \u2018crumbs'. This will lead to a Christian revival, heralding complete victory.There was an interesting discussion between Jim Jeffries and some QAnon adherents, which suggests that beliefs amongst this community vary considerably. One person stated that Queen Elizabeth II is a shapeshifting reptilian, while another asserted that Hillary Clinton consumes infant blood. All of those interviewed felt that the other's ideas were crazy. The Great Awakening There are numerous videos on YouTube which provide updates, such as the claim of an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The video I watched began with \u201chello patriots.\u201d A woman is described as stopping a possible assassination, and was said to be attending a Trump rally in a Q shirt, where POTUS \u201cmight point her out.\u201d Concerns are raised about Jeff Sessions\u2019 safety, and the narrator asks us \u201cto keep Jeff Sessions in prayer,\u201d adding that he doesn't want to go into too much detail. There is a great deal of rambling drivel about dirt and cover-ups, delivered in a soporific nasal drone. QAnon adherents have also circulated unfounded claims on YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit that there are paedophiles amongst Hollywood celebrities. The following is from qanon.pub:The exhortation to \u201cFight Fight Fight\u201d is deeply troubling, and these angry fantasies have real-world consequences. In June an armed man in a Q shirt blocked traffic at the Hoover Dam with an armoured truck, and a man acting suspiciously was photographed outside the offices of Micheal Avenetti, lawyer to Stormy Daniels. Avenetti also features heavily in the Q fantasy universe. In March Reddit banned a community discussing QAnon for \u201cencouraging or inciting violence and posting personal and confidential information.\u201d (3) \u2018Holy Fire\u2019 suspect Forrest Clark posted about QAnon, and Jeffrey Boyd made several references to QAnon prior to his arrest for threatening to kill Trump. (4) It seems doubtful that everyone in the QAnon community is psychotic, but there does seem to be a risk that ideas espoused could trigger dangerous behaviour in some. QAnon followers backed Veterans on Patrol\u2019s (VOP) call for a state of emergency in Arizona. This follows discovery of a homeless encampment containing a Barbie doll, stroller, Playboy magazines,septic tank, and straps on a tree (commonly used to secure food out of the reach of animals). The group concluded that this indicated child sex-trafficking, although police investigated and found no evidence of this. A man also occupied a cement plant in Tucson, believing it was involved in international child sex-trafficking. (5) VOP began patrolling the area, and while their motives are good, such hysteria may put homeless people at risk from others. QAnon have aded to hysteria about imaginary paedophile conspiracies, which have the potential to do a great deal of harm. Trump's habit of promoting conspiracy theories, such as the birther idea and the association of Ted Cruz's father with Kennedy's assassination, feeds into these right wing conspiracy fantasies. Trump deliberately encourages supporters like those in the QAnon community to view his \u2018enemies\u2019 as their own. This includes the \u2018enemy of the people\u2019 media, and members of his own government, such as Jeff Sessions. Is there any wonder that QAnon fantasise about conspiracies in Trump's own administration, law enforcement, and intelligence services? He seems to favour giving people something to get angry and frustrated about, especially as the mid-term elections are coming up. As Caitlin Huey-Bush of CNN says, this is to encourage supporters to get out to the polls. \u2018Q\u2019 is a reference to Q-level security clearance, but the real identity and origin of Q is unknown. This could have been a prank started in somebody's parent's basement, or a more co-ordinated campaign with malign intent, or a marketing campaign for YouTube channels. Who knows? It might even be Trump's cheeto testicles bashing away at a keyboard in Area 51. It's impossible to say, so I'll leave any fantasist speculation in the hands of QAnon. Regardless of Q's origins, it does seem that some are profiting. In November 2017 two 4chan moderators (Paul Furber and Coleman Rogers) and a YouTuber (Tracey Diaz) teamed up to promote what was, at the time, an obscure cryptic post. Diaz's YouTube channel now has more than 90,000 subscribers, and her videos have attracted over 8 million views. Diaz now relies on the donations which fund her \u2018research' as her sole source of income. Rogers and his wife have a YouTube channel which asks for donations.

It is widely reported that they think Trump is Q, but that is not entirely true, some do, but Q is the saviour they each choose to believe in.Q is both overthrowing and being overthrown by a vast secret conspiracy. They seem to love these mutually contradictory assertions. Acceptance of contradictory assertions without question is mandatory. Questioning contradictions is absolute proof somebody is an outsider, is not really one of them.The enemy of Q is both too weak and too strong; like I said they love their mutually contradictory assertions. The enemy is lazy, stupid and cowards, but Q cannot act because the enemy is too strong right now.What normal people call democracy is actually the conspiracy. I suppose that technically democracy is a conspiracy, one that involves the majority of people and is not a secret. However democracy is bad, because those others have different opinions like believing in democracy.Those democratic conspiracists are trying to take over the world. Technically I suppose this is also true since most normal people want the world to benefit from the freedoms provided by democracy. However they think this is bad and questioning why democracy it is bad is proof you are others. It is bad because it give others a voice.Every democratically elected leader is in on the conspiracy, technically true again, but bad because it is not the voice of Q, unless it is.Some of the world\u2019s dictators such as Putin & Kim are simultaneously part of the conspiracy, part of the resistance against the conspiracy, beholden to the conspiracy, fifth columnists in both the resistance and the conspiracy.Double think ideas should not be contradicted unless you want to be condemned as other. Others are puppets of the conspiracists, you know those leading the wrong kind of people. Only true Q believers know which is which and speculation is encourage to deceive the conspiracy. Questioning speculation is proof you are one of the others.The conspiracists are all paedophiles, unfounded allegations of paedophile of the others, the enemies of Q is encouraged. The others ritually sacrificed children in hidden basements that never appear on plans because of conspiracy. A classic case of projecting their own dark perversion in some cases.In practice they are mostly deeply deluded people who\u2019s paranoia is being preyed on by a small number of malignant individuals for their own delight and personal profit.",

The believers trouble me as a group by expressing affinity with fascist and extreme religious ideas.

QAnon beliefs are a distorted reflection of the reasonable anger felt by many Americans, such as the idea that the US has been let down by previous Presidents, and that a corrupt elite have betrayed the nation's interests. As delusional and baseless QAnon's beliefs are, they might still have the potential to attract many more followers. The views held by QAnon adherents may seem fairly marginal at present, but this group have already won the approval of some big names, including Roseanne Barr, former Red Sox player Curt Schilling, and anti-abortionist Cheryl Sullenger. Marginal groups can quickly become mainstream, as was the case in pre-war Germany. Minority Far-right movements also have the potential to exert influence, Germany's AFD and the UK's UKIP and DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) are examples of the influence a minority party or group can exert. The angry, paranoid fantasies of QAnon have already had some real world consequences. In March Reddit banned a QAnon community for \u201cencouraging or inciting violence and posting personal and confidential information.\u201d (1) A man acting suspiciously was photographed outside the offices of Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawyer Michael Avenetti. Pictures of Avenetti\u2019s offices had been posted online by QAnon believers. In June an armed man in a Q shirt blocked traffic with an armoured vehicle at the Hoover Dam. (2) QAnon followers also backed Veterans on Patrol (VOP) in calling for a state of emergency in Arizona. This followed discovery by a VOP group of a makeshift homeless encampment containing a Barbie doll, stroller, straps fixed to a tree, Playboy magazines, and a septic tank. The group concluded that this indicated a child sex trafficking camp, and asked police to investigate. The police found no evidence to support the group's belief, but VOP are now patrolling the area searching for child sex camps. (3) VOP may have good intentions, but this hype is likely to put homeless people at risk from others. QAnon are egging VOP on, and there may be a chance that this could affect public perception of risk. Hysteria about imaginary paedophilia is never desirable. QAnon belief encourages referential ideas, such as the conviction that Trump sends them coded messages via Twitter by using the letter Q, or by leaving deliberately timed gaps between tweets which correspond to 17 (Q being the seventeenth letter of the alphabet). In those without psychotic illnesses such beliefs may be harmlessly eccentric. However, in those with paranoid schizophrenia thoughts like this can trigger distress, self-harm, or anger towards others. QAnon believers are ripe for exploitation by unscrupulous leaders and politicians, including Trump but not excluding others even further to the right. There has been no violence I'm aware of so far, but there are a worrying number of risk factors.Reddit bans popular deep state conspiracy forum for inciting violence.

But please only treat it as merely filler until an Arab, especially and Arab American has a chance to answer the questions. 1. Arabs are all Muslim. While it\u2019s true that many are, there are also many Christian Arabs. In fact, some of the earliest Christians were Arab. One of these Christian Arab Americans was quite famous is Oregon politics decades ago: Vic Atiyeh 2. Arabs are different from \u201cwhite\u201d Americans. The US State Department still considers Arab to be Caucasian/white. That will really mess with the bigots in America, who want to think of them as racially different. The fact is, I can\u2019t really tell just looking at a person if they are of Arabian descent or not. They really don\u2019t look any different from other \u201cwhite\u201d folks. For example, here is a picture of Vic Atiyeh in his later years:3. The Arabs and Israeli Jews are two completely different peoples. Arabs are a Semitic people, as are many (but most certainly not all) Jews. This is confusing to people, since \u201canti-Semitism\u201d is America\u2019s term for hatred of Jewish people almost exclusively. Although many, many Jewish people are Semitic, Judaism is a religion, not a race. Just as Arab or Arabian is an ethnicity, not a religion. It also means Arabs and Semitic Jews are relatively closely related, more or less descendants of two different \u201ctribes\u201d who shared the same lands long before Mohammed and even Jesus. The story of Abraham in the Bible and in the Koran tells of his sons, Isaac and Ishmael, who were Hebrew and Arab respectively. 4. Arabs are a backward people. Arabs- not Europeans- preserved and transcribed the writings of Ancient Greece we enjoy today. The Arab cities of the medieval times were the greatest centers of learning anywhere in the world, except possibly China. They were extremely cosmopolitan and many of them still exist today. Baghdad, Beirut, Acre, Alexandria, and many more than I can list, are all very old places, especially modern Mesopotamia, which is now called Iraq. And Arabs aren\u2019t \u201cbackward\u201d today either. One of the most modern cities and popular tourist destinations has been Beirut, Lebanon. One of the most modern and interesting tourist destination up until just a few years ago was Syria. One of the richest and most popular wealth tourist destinations is Dubai. Once you throw in Cairo, Marakesh, and who knows how many modern, popular cities, it makes it hard to see what this \u201cbackwardness\u201d Americans like to talk about really is. 5. Arabic is a harsh, guttural language. Arabic is one of the coolest, and frankly, sexiest languages I\u2019ve ever heard. Okay, this is purely my opinion and not objective, but like many people, I believed stupid racist Hollywood stereotypes, which never had people speaking Arabic in conversational voices. Ironically, some folks out there consider English to be a harsh-sounding, guttural language 6. Arabs were/are mostly camel riding people. Arab sailors were Europe\u2019s main cultural and trade connection to the Far East. In fact, when many Arabs had converted to Islam in the early Medieval times, they spread the religion along with their trade to East Asia, so that today much of the Philippines, Indonesia, parts of China, and many, many other East Asian and Pacific Island countries and peoples are Muslim, thanks to the influence of Arab explorers. Except for the Polynesians, and maybe the Chinese, I consider Arabs to be some of the finest seafarers in history. Also, though some desert lands make camels a wiser choice as a pack animal, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever been as popular to Arabs as horses, especially since Arabs were considered- and as far as I know, are still considered, some of the best horse-breeders in the world, possibly even in all of the history of the world. The most prized horse in Europe was at one time, the Arab charger. And of course modern Arabian horses got that name because Arabs were the ones, long long ago, that created that now easily recognizable breed [I should note as a caveat, I know almost nothing about horse breeding. But even I\u2019ve heard of Arabian horses, so I thought it would be worth noting]. 7. The [Grand] Ayatollah rules most of the Arab world. The Ayatollah may have particular significance to Shi\u2019i outside Iran (and the title can apply to many different Shia religious leaders) but Ayatollah one Americans think of is Iranian, not Arab. Of course most Americans don\u2019t know that Iranians were once referred to as Persians, and are descendants of one of the oldest and longest-running empires on Earth. They are a great and interesting people themselves, but they are not Arabs. In fact, they speak far more Farsi than Arabic in Iran, since that is their national and historic language. Those are just a few off the top of my head. I admit this is a pretty flimsy list. To be honest, the number of misconceptions Americans have about Islam dwarfs the number of misconceptions we have about Arabs. But then, most Christian Americans still don\u2019t understand there is a distinction. I also think I should add an honorable mention- most Americans view Arabs and Muslims as violent, as if the Crusades were not the most disgusting, disturbing cases of genocide the world has ever seen- all committed by Christians against Muslims, Jews, and Arab Christians, and anyone else within sword-swinging distance. People don\u2019t get that Jihad is an Arabic term in the Koran which has more to do with establishing basic rules of war, not a holy war as Christians think of it. Though I don\u2019t really know any Arabic, I really love the most common phrase I\u2019ve heard, a simple greeting from Muslims: \u201cSalaam alaikum,\u201d which means, \u201cPeace to you.\u201d Doesn\u2019t sound at all like a vicious, cruel people to me. Maybe all of that time being colonized by Europeans and/or bombed by US planes makes some Arabs decide they want to fight back, but don\u2019t pretend that they started these wars. History will show Britain and France did most of that, and America jumped in under the pretense of fighting the Cold War. Note: I apologize to any Arabs for my clumsy attempts here. I know this doesn\u2019t really do justice to your culture and history, and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve made some mistakes here. Sadly, even my sparse knowledge of the Arab world dwarfs that of most Americans I know. Further Note: some well-intentioned European Americans have told me it\u2019s rude to say \u201cJew\u201d and I should say Jewish, and they often say similar things about the word \u201cArab.\u201d If I offended anyone of Judaic or Arabian backgrounds I sincerely apologize and will gladly edit this. However, unless told otherwise, I think considering \u201cJew\u201d or \u201cArab\u201d to be bad words is itself bigoted, and I find it extremely rude to even think there is something wrong with being an Arab or a Jew.",

It was a favourite dish on New Year\u2019s Eve in Lancashire Catholic households - or rather it was taken out of the oven just before the striking of midnight. New Year\u2019s Eve, preceding as it does the Feast of the Circumcision, used to be a day of abstinence, To rush to eat meat as soon as the vigil was over was seen as a jocular flirting with sin, and the New Year hotpot was called the Devil\u2019s Supper.",
            "No way. I don\u2019t even want to live in a city big enough where \u201cliving on the 50th floor\u201d is a thing, and it\u2019s got nothing to do with heights. I get edgy when there are too many people around. Too much traffic, too many problems, too much noise and pollution. No thanks.

            "This is actually an interesting question. In terms of height and views of the city, there is a point of diminishing returns which, when exceeded, results in less desirable views.

Ideally, the view should be seen from sitting positions on sofas and chairs. If it\u2019s not, you\u2019re too high.

How should i climb 50 floors?The worst case is when the elevator stops between the 25th and 26th floor while I am inside it.

Subsequent authors have adapted his lore and added their own, so there\u2019s no one set of rules for all. And even within the novel, it is not necessary consistent or logical. Stoker had to give the humans some advantage over a powerful supernatural being, and having it forced to obey certain natural (for it) laws was a good device. Dracula cannot cross running water of his own volition. This means he can be transported in a container of earth from his ancestral home, but he can\u2019t choose to cross a river, or presumably an ocean, under his own power. This is an effective means of constricting his otherwise considerable power of movement, and of predicting his path. It may be a metaphor for his avoidance of the cleansing power of water and for change, and the constant flux of one element, while another protects him, reinforcing his status as an ancient, primeval creature. As for circles, they are also a metaphor for the forces that constrict or form boundaries, whether spiritual, supernatural, natural, or human-made, reinforcing the foundational truth that nothing under God has no laws to obey. Team Van Helsing uses a circle of consecrated hosts to protect Mina from Dracula.",
            "Since you\u2019ve asked this question as if such beings are real, and tagged with \u201cSupernatural Phenomena\u201d but not with \u201cFolklore\u201d or some such, I\u2019m going to answer from the perspective of an animist and occultist who literally believes in such things, rather than from the perspective of an academic folklorist or analyzer of fiction. Witches - real witches - absolutely can cross running water or enter a circle of salt. I myself am a witch, and know many witches.

WithContinue ReadingSince you\u2019ve asked this question as if such beings are real, and tagged with \u201cSupernatural Phenomena\u201d but not with \u201cFolklore\u201d or some such, I\u2019m going to answer from the perspective of an animist and occultist who literally believes in such things, rather than from the perspective of an academic folklorist or analyzer of fiction. Witches - real witches - absolutely can cross running water or enter a circle of salt. I myself am a witch, and know many witches. We\u2019re just physical humans with no such supernatural limitations. We can go into churches too, and touch Bibles or crosses, no problem. With real vampires and ghosts, it varies. Some of them can cross a bridge over running water; others can\u2019t, or may do so with some difficulty, or may cross if there\u2019s a bridge but not cross a stream with no bridge. The issue is that running water is spiritually purifying. Spirits comprised of impurity may be disrupted or destroyed by running water. Normally they would have to actually touch the water, but many are afraid to cross over it or even go near it. Exact edges sometimes get a little fuzzy in the spirit world; the purifying, flowing energies of the running water may extend a little beyond the water itself, and the energetic field of the spirit may also be somewhat amorphous, such that they may be affected even a short distance away from the water. A circle of salt is a little different. Salt itself is also spiritually purifying in a way and may harm certain spirits to touch. However, that\u2019s not so much what keeps them from passing over a circle. It\u2019s the act of will invested in the making of the circle. It doesn\u2019t have to be salt, though salt is especially effective against certain spirits and energies. But the key is the focused act of will that is performed when forming the circle. Far from being an anti-witch thing, it is itself an act of witchcraft. It might be used to ward off the spells of another witch, but it certainly won\u2019t keep out the witch themselves.",
            "People like to hear stories about powerful, malevolent entities, but they also like happy endings. If you make your evil protagonist too powerful, then your human heroes are not going to stand a chance against them. So it\u2019s a common trope to introduce arbitrary, pointless limitations on them of some kind or another, just to give the heroes a chance to trick and defeat them. Superman has Kryptonite. Jon Jon\u2019zz has fire and Green Lantern has the colour yellow. Vampires have the limitations described in your question in order to make it possible to tell interesting stories about them.",
            "On the first part of your query, it\u2019s because before Bram Stoker came along and described vampires as undead corpses, they were evil spirits.

Don't apply mask before make up After applying a mask, the stratum of the corneum is excessively hydrated, and the defensive ability of skin is lowered. So that the substances such as fragrances and preservatives in cosmetics are more likely to irritate the skin. 2.

Don't apply mask before make up After applying a mask, the stratum of the corneum is excessively hydrated, and the defensive ability of skin is lowered. So that the substances such as fragrances and preservatives in cosmetics are more likely to irritate the skin. 2. Sunscreen does not need to be removed separately Sunscreen products can be cleaned with ordinary cleansing product such as facial cleanser, and the extra makeup remover would increase the risk of over-cleaning. 3. It's sugar that makes you get pimples, not spicy food People with pimples are always blame spicy food. They don't know that spicy itself has nothing to do with their pimples, it's because spicy food is always accompanied by high oil and high salt which caused the pimples. Besides, the sweets that girls love are really pimple-prone things. 4. Remove makeup once, it takes 8 days for skin to repair After the makeup remover, we usually clean the face again with facial cleanser. This is a secondary cleansing, and the makeup remover is often used with a cotton pad, which is a kind of damage to the skin barrier. It takes about 6-8 days for the damage to be repaired. 5. Don't apply mask every day The main function of the mask is to replenish water. The healthiest condition of our cuticle water content is between 10% and 20%. It is not good if it is too much. Frequent application of the mask would cause excessive hydration of the stratum corneum and may damage the skin barrier. According to the skin condition of different people, it can be done twice a week. 6. Applying makeup 5 minutes after you have applied sunscreen Whether it is physical or chemical sunscreen, you should wait for it to dry a little. Otherwise, the makeup process such as the action of wiping and patting will cause the sunscreen to be uneven. 7. Don't spray your face with sunscreen spray Firstly, the spray is easy to spray into the eyes, and it is easy to be sucked in with the breath; Secondly, it's hard to put the sunscreen evenly with the way of spray; Finally, if you have makeup, it is more inconvenient to apply sunscreen lotion or cream. Considered this, you may still choose sunscreen spray, after all, it's better than nothing. But to remind everyone, sunscreen spray is oily, so it is easy to disturbing the makeup. It is better to use physical sunscreen product before makeup and taking an umbrella when about to go outside. 8. Detox is a bogus concept We are not venom, OK? We lived well when there is no such concept of \"detox\". The real detoxification organ of human body is liver, sweat doesn't detox, and neither does shit. 9. Primer won't prevent you from anything Primer with an SPF value is a make-up base with effect of a low-power sunscreen. It can't keep you from anything else. It can't keep you from haze pollution, can't keep you from radiation, can't keep you from makeup ingredients. 10. No need to turn off the light when applying Vitamin C and Retinol It's usually said that we should avoid light when put on Vitamin C and Retinol. The light we mentioned here is the sunlight, not lamplight. There's no need to put on Vitamin C and Retinol during the day, because they will get oxidized, so that they work very well, it's kind of a waste. By the way, we worried that you might fall if you turn off the light. 11. If you want to age slower, use sunscreen all year round The sun does not only show up in summer, ultraviolet rays are not only available in summer, so don't just put on sunscreen in summer. Use it EVERYDAY! 12. It doesn't matter if you eat lipstick, as long as it is a formal qualified product Of course, what I mean is the lipstick you put on your lips, not really asking you to eat it up. Most people are afraid of lead in lipstick, but according to the regulations, the daily intake of lead in a woman's normal lipstick is about 0.96 micrograms. The salt intake per person is around 10.6 grams a day, and the lead content in these salts is around 21.2 micrograms. Obviously, the amount of lead in the lipstick is completely within the safe range of the human body. 13. Toner can't be patted into the skin An elephant's cannot step on an ant, and your \"huge\" fingers can't touch the water molecules. Even if you can touch the water molecules, it still has nothing to do with whether the water molecules can be absorbed by your skin or not. 14. The golden period of removing scar is within the six months after the scab falls off If you want to remove scar you should take advantage of this time. Use medicine or aesthetic medicine. After the golden period, it will be even more difficult. 15. Skin care products can't really shrink pores If an elastic band has already been stretched up and has lost its elasticity, don't expect that it could return to its original shape, and the pores are the same. If you do want to shrink your pores, you'd better try aesthetic medicine, just lie down and let them do the rest. 16. Don't share sun umbrella with others Because... The area everyone occupies of the umbrella would be smaller, and they would be close to the edge of the umbrella, the sunscreen effect there is not good. 17. Skin care technique has nothing to do with the effect I mentioned about pat above. Actually, there are much more than it, lifting, massage, etc. Please, save your face! From the perspective of the efficacy of skin care products, they are useless. You feel like that skin care products are absorbed faster, but they are actually evaporated faster. 18. Foam has little to do with cleansing power There are many factors that affect the cleansing power of a product, such as its cleaning ingredients, the content, and other ingredients. It\u2019s really difficult to judge by the foam alone. 19. Use sunscreen after you use acid Some acids have the effect of remove the cutin. After using the acid, the skin barrier is in a weaker condition. So that you should pay particular attention to sunscreen, otherwise the risk of sunburn will be higher. 20. Boys use girls' skin care products will not become girly ...I don't want to explain about this. By the way, cola won't cause infertile. 21. To prevent hair loss and to grow hair is not the same There are people always wondering that why they didn't grow a hair after using anti-hair loss products. Why should the anti-hair loss products make people grow their hair? Anti-hair loss is to prevent the hair from falling off; hair growth, is another thing. 22. Choosing what kind (brand) of skin care product has nothing to do with your age \"My mom is using this brand, am I too young to use it?\" Come on! What skin care products should you use is related to your skin type and condition but has nothing to do with your age. When you choose skin care products the sales would say: This is good for you because it's an oil-control product or it could replenishing water. I never met anyone ban you from buying anything because you are too young or too old. 23. Keep your makeup tools clean Make-up products are usually sterilized and preservative, they won't bring much trouble. But brushes and makeup sponge are being used again and again. If they are not cleaned frequently, they will be the paradise of the bacterium. 24. You won't get thicker hair after shaving It is said that the more you shave, the thicker your hair would be. However, mechanisms of action on hair growth is inside the skin and scraping outside the skin couldn't affect the inside at all. But many people would say that their hair do looks thicker after shaving. That's because our hair is showing a cross section when without being scratched. Shaving the hair is like to making a oblique section for the hair, which is much larger than the cross section. So that your hair looks thicker. 25. You are risking your life when Squeeze your pimple There is a network of veins that sit behind your facial triangle area, called cavernous sinus. Squeezing your pimples in this area may cause the blood go back to the cavernous sinus with bacteria, which may lead to embolization of the cavernous sinus. The consequences are...bad! 26. Preservatives are not terrible, neither are chemicals Don't be crazy about products that claimed have no preservatives added in. As long as it is a qualified product, the amount of preservatives and other chemicals must be controlled within a standard for skin safety. Be careful about those preservative-free products. The growth of microorganisms must be inhibited. If no preservative is added, what is added then? 27. Pure nature is not equal to safe & effective Consumers like products with that kind of Pure-nature slogan on its package. The truth is that pure nature is not always the safest and the most effective. Some natural extracts are even more complex and pose a higher risk to the skin. 28. You an do skin care and makeup during pregnancy Whether it is skin care products or cosmetics, they can only affect the epidermal layer but far away from the fetus. Besides, in the regulations, skin care products and cosmetics that are not available to pregnant women will not be approved. Therefore, as long as it is a qualified product, it can be used with no worry. 29. Don't buy any DIY skincare product There are some people who DIY skin care products themselves. This product can be used by themselves, but it is not legal for sale in many countries. DIY skincare products are also not guaranteed to be safe. Is the microbiological control qualified? Have you add preservatives? How much has it added? Are the raw materials and packaging materials qualified? Have your products met the national regulations for skin care products? 30. It's not the more ingredients, the better Some people like long ingredients lists, and they think if the things inside are rich the effect must be better. Those products with short ingredients list, It must not work very well. Actually, the more complex the ingredients are, the more potential instability factors there would be, and they would pose a higher risk to the skin. Just like eating too much different things can hurt your stomach. 31. It's not the more function, the better The way the functional ingredients in skin care products work is \"signal transmission.\" If there are too many signals transmitted at one time, your skin can't take it. It's like if your boss assigned you one or two task, you will remember it and do it very well. But if ten tasks are assigned at once, you will break down. 32. Oily skin also need to be hydrated Many girls with oily skin would have ideas like: There is enough oil so there must be no shortage of water. And they won't pay much attention to hydration. Whether the skin is oil or not is the matter of sebaceous glands. Whether the skin is dry or not is the matter of water content of the stratum corneum. Sebum secreted by sebaceous glands can affect the water content of the stratum corneum, but it's not the only factor. Therefore, the hydration still needs to be done! 33. Less is more This is the idea of streamlining skin care. Like we said above: It's not the more ingredients in the product, the better. It's also not the more skin care products you use, the better. More skin care products means more ingredients and higher concentration, so it's more likely to irritate the skin. 34. Skin care intolerance is not necessarily a product problem Everyone has the possibility of being intolerant of certain ingredients. This does not mean that the product has a problem or is a fake. Therefore, I hope that everyone will treat it rationally. Someone would be allergic to drug, and someone even be allergic to eggs. 35. Medicines can't be used as skin care products There are people ask me about medical matters, however, I am not professional in this field. So I suggest you go to a professional doctor. There are even some people eager to try prescription drugs. Drugs are drugs, which are used to treat diseases, Don't use it carelessly. 36. Age spots are not for old people only The age spots are also known as \"liver spots\", which appear gradually as people age. But this is not for the elderly only. I have already had two age spots on my arm. That's because I was lazy and I never use sunscreen when I was young. Therefore, if you don't want to have age spots at a young age, you should use sunscreen every day. 37. High concentration of VC may turn cuticle yellow, but it will be recovered after stop using it. Many people said after they use VC for a while, they felt that their skin turned yellow. This is indeed possible, especially in the thick part of the stratum corneum, which is more likely to block the VC. After a while, VC will oxidize and turn yellow. 38. Do not use cleansing soap every day Cleansing soap is alkaline and our skin surface is weak-acidic, which means the cleancing soap is not that good for our skin. Most of the cleansing soap has a strong cleaning power, which is also not that good to our skin barrier. 39. People with sensitive skin is recommended to use physical sunscreen Chemical sunscreens are more complex and more likely to irritate the skin. So that it's more likely to cause sensitive skin reactions. 40. Seborrheic dermatitis, rose acne can not be cured Sorry to say that, but we have consulted doctors, this is true. Seborrheic dermatitis, rose acne is easy to recur repeatedly. Therefore, everyone need to protect the skin and minimizes the possibility of getting seborrheic dermatitis and rose acne. 41. Gold, diamonds in skin care products are just gimmicks Sounds very high-end, after all, this is real money. But the problem is it doesn't work at all. According to a friend who has worked in the skincare giant industry, they have produced a skin care product with gold powder inside. In order to prevent some people who wants to do the trick, a tiny bottle of gold powder is taken care of by a manager. When the other processes are done, the manager would hold the bottle of gold powder, mysteriously and carefully poured it into the product. After mixing evenly, the product can be bottled. Gossip, just for fun. 42. There is no way to repair split hair Split hair, it is separated, like our two legs, Unless we stick them on, they can not grow together 43. Put more sunscreen on snowy days Ultraviolet light in winter is weaker than in summer, but snow reflects various light. Especially in the north, people will have this kind of experience: winter night with a thick snow outside is very bright. 44. Damage to the skin barrier will take at least six months to repair Sometimes it takes more than 6 months to repair. Repairing the skin barrier is somehow more troublesome than repairing a broken relationship. I know there are lots of people who want to try all kinds of functional skincare products: Whitening and anti-aging and so on. But please be patient, know your skin and choose the most suitable skin care products. Don't damage your skin and waste your money. 45. Towels for face should be kept dry and clean People need water, viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms also need water, the humid environment is best for them to reproduce. Our towel wipes our face every day, it is very moist... Therefore, our towels should be cleaned very often. When not being washed, it is best to hang it outside. 46. The main function of the spray is to soothe the skin, not to hydrate the skin Many people buy sprays and want to hydrate the skin by using it. Unlucky, you may be disappointed. The most important fuction of the spray is to soothe the skin. If your face turn red in the hot summer, you can use it to soothe your skin; if your skin is sensitive and itchy, you can use it to soothe your skin; if your face is tight in the air-conditioned room, you can use it to soothe your skin. But when it comes to hydrating, in fact, spray can't do much help. It could only hydrates the outermost layers of the dry stratum corneum. Moisture is difficult to penetrate from the outside into the skin. This is also the function of the skin barrier. 47. Don't put your skincare products into other containers Qualified skin care products are strictly inspected in terms of anti-corrosion and compatibility between products and packaging materials. If you put the skincare products into other containers, the contact area between the product and the packaging material becomes larger, the microbial growth may be accelerated, and the compatibility of the packaging material with the product may also be a problem.",

I keep experimenting but certain things have really impacted my skin in a beautiful way. Now, I never had a problem of acne or pimples ever! I had dull and lustreless skin. Very dry and without glow. So, during these 8 years, I have gradually adapted many skincare practices which ultimately showed their effects. I had the capacity to have a beautiful skin because parents have great skin but I just needed to be disciplined. So here is what I did -Multiple articles and blogs had hammered me to drink lots of water so I did it. I started drinking lots of water. I used measure my water intake by drinking from a 1 ltr water bottle. Drinking water I can say is alone very capable of bringing glow and health to your skin and others are just extra tips. Water is life! Now, I can\u2019t do without a considerable amount of water in a day because the body is habitual of it.aI control my junk. I am not a junk lover at all. Because its in grained in my brain that junk will harm my skin. So I am habitual of eating healthy. I don\u2019t like oily chips, sev, chivdas, samosas, burgers, vada pav, fries or anything of that sort. I like pasta and chinese but I burn them effectively. I just don\u2019t drool over junk at all because it is so effectly in grained in my mind. And I have made myself that way over the years that now I have water in my mouth seeing healthy recipes.I love all fruits and vegetables. I eat at least one fruit a day but during seasons, I gorge on fruits and salads. Apples, strawberries, oranges, grapes, watermelon, peaches, pomegranates, bananas and many others. Fruits bring glow to the skin especially the ones rich in Vitamin C. And salads are refreshing to your skin.I strongly believe in, \u201cyou are what you eat!\u201d and for a lovely skin, you have to clear it from inside and the effect will show on the outside. And drinking hot water flushes out toxins. I do that by drinking either green tea or lemon warm water everyday.Another super important tip is sleep. But sleep at the right time. I have rigid dark circles and even if I sleep for 8 hours but later than the usual time, I will wake up with dark circles. So, only if I sleep at a reasonable time and wake up fresh, then the face is fresh and glowing!I protect my skin from pollution by covering my face appropriately but I breathe deep in fresh and windy places. Right, deep and continuous breathing is also very important.7. I keep rubbing ice on my face, used lemons, left over green tea leaves, orange peels. Basically, nothing fancy. I use everything leftover after use which should be used. All of them have been pretty effective on dark circles and overall clearing of skin. 8. I exfoliate but not much. I use a good face wash and dove for my skin. I still don\u2019t know any fancy products. 9. I do face yoga because I have plump cheeks for reasons best known to God but it helps blood circulation in my face. 10. I am less on salt. Too much salt creates itching sensation and it shows its effect on skin. I do not put salt on fruits or drinks. I avoid salt wherever required.11. If you want to head out for an event and you need to look fresh and glowing, quick fix is that drink a ltr of water and rub ice on your face. That much amount of water will want you to pee so do have enough time in hand. But you will feel so fresh after sometime. This is a simple trick that models use before shows or before getting down from flights because air pressure in flights makes your skin dry. And these tips are a part of my daily life!  ",

But not everyone has a camera-ready complexion, every cream doesn\u2019t work for every skin type, supplements aren\u2019t magic elixirs, and drinking plenty of water is a super healthy habit, sure, but guzzling a ton of H2O isn\u2019t going to remedy the chronic eczema I\u2019ve been dealing with since age 8. After spending more than a decade playing with beauty products as part of my job\u2014and more importantly, interviewing hundreds of dermatologists and skin experts\u2014I\u2019ve learned to parse out the BS advice from what really works and is worth spending your hard-earned money on. Here\u2019s the most important skin-care advice I\u2019ve learned. Oh, and make sure to drink plenty of water. 1. Squeezing a pimple will never, ever make it better, faster. Translation: Stop touching your face. Your hands are covered in bacteria most of the time (just think about all the stuff you touch). If you\u2019re touching an already-inflamed zit or infection, you\u2019re only adding debris to the pimple and delaying its demise. Plus, popping a pimple doesn\u2019t do your skin or the zit itself any good, particularly if it\u2019s a swollen, large cyst without a whitehead on top, which will only get worse when you try to squeeze. 2. More product does not equal better skin. In fact, there are certain products you should never mix. As a product hoarder, I have an entire armoire filled with masks, lotions, creams, peels, oils, and serums. It\u2019s incredibly tempting to pile on at least one of each every day and night because, it\u2019s right there, and well, it\u2019s my job. But more product isn\u2019t a good thing. Too much product can clog pores (especially if the moisturizers aren\u2019t noncomedogenic). Plus, certain ingredients don\u2019t play well together. For example, retinol and other exfoliating ingredients\u2014salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and benzoyl peroxide\u2014should not be used at the same time because the skin can get really dry. 3. You don\u2019t need to spend $300 on a skin-care product for it to be really good. Listen, we\u2019ve all heard about the miraculous powers of ultra-expensive potions and lotions, but there\u2019s just zero reason you\u2019d ever need to spend a week\u2019s worth of grocery money on a little hydration boost. Frankly, most top dermatologists I\u2019ve worked with prefer skin-care products sourced from the drugstore. For example, my current derma, Michele Farber, M.D., of Schweiger Dermatology in New York City, pushes drugstore-staple Crave samples on me after every visit. It\u2019s just the best one, in her professional opinion. I have combination skin, but dermas love it for acne-prone complexions, too. 4. SPF is key\u2014and you can make it even better with some mix-ins, too. If you needed to have a skin-care desert island pick, it\u2019s got to be SPF. Any dermatologist will tell you that sunscreen is the most-important skin-care step because it protects from free radical damage that can cause skin cancer and early signs of aging. Hot tip: If it leaves a bit of a white residue, try adding a few drops of a liquid lionizer, bronzer, or even face tint to avoid that whole ghostly look. 5. Your neck and d\u00e9colletage deserve as much TLC as your mug. Just because your neck and d\u00e9colletage\u2014you know, the fancy French term for the delicate area around your clavicle and above the breasts\u2014aren\u2019t technically on your face doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need the same kind of TLC. In fact, dermatologists consider the face and neck as a part of one skin unit because your d\u00e9colletage is susceptible to the same signs of skin damage. There are many products designed specifically for the area below the chin. Some of them advertise lifting and firming properties. (Though as someone with a 34D bra size, I can tell you I haven\u2019t seen any of that kick in.) 6. Save the bulk of your skin-care routine for bedtime. Several years ago, I asked a fellow beauty editor and colleague who had the most baby-soft skin about her routine. She was also perennially late every morning, so I assumed her morning skin-care routine was extensive. But actually, she was rushing in after oversleeping. She admitted to a lengthy nighttime skin-care regimen. Before bed, she was diligent doing a double cleanse, exfoliation, toner or mask, plus a few targeted serums and a night cream. In the morning, though? She\u2019d splash her face with water and use a bit of simple moisturizer. It\u2019s a tip I haven\u2019t forgotten after all these years. Derms agree that the skin repairs itself overnight, so things like retinol and thick moisturizer are best used in the evening. 7. Layer skin-care products from thinnest to thickest in terms of texture. Think about your skin like a sponge that wants to soak up all of the goodness you\u2019re applying. Therefore, it\u2019s important to first employ the thinnest, water-like products such as an essence or serum and then follow with heavier moisturizers and oils, which help to seal everything in. Oils, in particular, have occlusive properties, which literally create a barrier between skin and the air\u2014anything applied on top of them is basically done in vain. 8. You can give your skin a rosy glow with just some sleight of hand (or a Downward Dog). Facial massage is not just something out of a self-care book. It\u2019s a quick way to get a gorgeous, natural flush. Personally, I like to use a jade roller to boost circulation (I\u2019m a huge fan of crystals). You can use your fingertips, too. Just make sure you use a serum or oil with some slip to it in order to gently glide over the skin without too much friction. 9. When it\u2019s warmer outside, stow all your skin care in the fridge. I do this year-round for my eye cream, as I\u2019m convinced the cool temperature helps deflate puffiness while also waking me up with a quick cooling rush. (Think about all those eye creams with metal ball roller tips\u2014that\u2019s why those exist!) When it gets hot out, I start to stow everything in the fridge. Nail polish, for example, doesn\u2019t thicken as quickly if it\u2019s kept cool. Face masks are even more relaxing when chilled. The gel creams I love don\u2019t evaporate in my sweltering apartment. And during the summer, there\u2019s literally nothing more refreshing than piling on a tub of a thick minty body lotion fresh out the fridge, especially after a great workout.",

That would be your 1st step towards success. You'll be one step closer to your aim. From that day onwards live like a winner. See yourself winning.

            "If you touch a baby bird, the general rule is that its parents will not reject it because of your scent. This is a common misconception. However, it's still best to avoid handling baby birds unless absolutely necessary, as they are delicate and can be easily injured. If you come across a baby bird that appears to be abandoned, it's best to contact a local wildlife rehabilitator or animal rescue organization for guidance on how to proceed.",

            "Actually, Dorian, the moon does move closer to earth, and by a lot more than 10 inches.

There are some other things that make the moon come a little closer or a little further, including the sun, which pulls on both the earth and the moon.  This very weekend the moon is actually going to be closer than it's been in 20 years, another 5,000 miles closer than it usually is at its closest point. One other detail: ten inches won't make much difference, but the moon may well pull you ten inches closer every single day.  You know about tides, that pull the oceans closer to the moon.  If you were on a boat, you'd be a little higher at high tide, and a little closer to the moon by a few feet.  But even on land, there are \"land tides\" of about 5 inches or so, depending on where you are. And by the way: the moon is in fact moving away from the earth, by about half an inch a year.  By the time you're 20, the moon will have moved 10 inches from the time you were born.  Trust me, you won't notice the difference.",
            "We know what would happen if the Moon was suddenly only 25 000 miles/40 000 km from Earth because it already happened in our planet's past. When the Mars-sized planet collided with Earth 4.5 billion years ago, it caused the ejection of matter that formed an excretion disk from which the Moon coalesced. At first, it was closer than 25 000 miles/40 000 km away. Some evidence point to it being only twice as far as the diameter of the Earth, which is 7900 miles/12 700 km. This caused tides that were miles/thousands of meters high. At the time, there were no continents yet. Only some volcanic islandContinue ReadingWe know what would happen if the Moon was suddenly only 25 000 miles/40 000 km from Earth because it already happened in our planet's past. When the Mars-sized planet collided with Earth 4.5 billion years ago, it caused the ejection of matter that formed an excretion disk from which the Moon coalesced. At first, it was closer than 25 000 miles/40 000 km away. Some evidence point to it being only twice as far as the diameter of the Earth, which is 7900 miles/12 700 km. This caused tides that were miles/thousands of meters high. At the time, there were no continents yet. Only some volcanic islands existed until about 3.2 billion years ago, and our planet was almost an ocean world. Such tall tides soaked these volcanos with water every few hours because the length of the day was only about 4.5 hours. The tides would be similarly tall if the Moon were as near our planet again. Our world contains continents now; water would not be able to wash all of them every few hours. There would be some safe locations from it in taller mountains and very high plateaus. Water would not, however, be the only danger. The Moon being so near would also affect the lithosphere and cause massive volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. There would be no escape from it. Our civilization would collapse. The whole planet would be covered with thick clouds of ash that would prevent the rays of the Sun from reaching it. Most complex life would perish. Microbial and some hardy and tiny life forms would survive and perhaps give rise to a new biosphere a billion or more years later when the Moon moves away from our planet, and the situation would calm down. There wouldn't be much time for it because our world only has between 1 and 2.5 billion years before the Sun becomes too hot and make our planet too warm to host complex life. This is in contrast to the situation billions of years ago when the proximity of the Moon might have been one of the reasons why life on our planet emerged. The leading theory of why it happened points to hydrothermal vents as their possible origin. The influence of the Moon on the lithosphere increased the areas covered with hydrothermal vents, which might have made such a low probability event as the emergence of life more likely. If first cells didn't emerge in hydrothermal vents but in some ponds on the surface, then these frequent tidal and receding waters contributed to the mixing of prebiotic chemistry. All of this means that if our Moon were suddenly only 25 000 miles/40 000 km away from Earth, it would destroy humanity, but when it happened at the beginning of the history of our planet, the miraculous life of our world might have been a splendid gift from this event. The question was: What would happen if the Moon were to suddenly be only 25,000 miles from Earth?",
            "Short answer: the day will be some microseconds longer. Also, the Moon will actually move away but not only 200 m, but with 49 milions meters! And not in 10,000 years but in just about 8 months from now. So be prepared! :) The Science and explanation:Moon orbit is not circular, but eccentric, and every month, the Moon pass the closer and then farther points vs Earth, the apogee and perigee. For example, this year, 2017, the Moon will be at the closest perigee of the year, or the closest point, on 26 May, at only 357,000 km or 222,000 miles, and at the farthest point, the farthest apogee of the Continue ReadingShort answer: the day will be some microseconds longer.

Now, you see, if the distance can vary in 8 months with 49,000,000 m and nothing special happens, (just greater/smaller tides) then, those extra 200 m gained in 10,000 years will not make any significant difference, only on the length of the day. The day will become some microseconds longer, because Earth is losing rotational speed (through tides) in favor of the Moon, to higher the Moon orbit. That's all. We will be all safe! :) PS: And by \u201cbe prepared\u201d I mean prepare your photo camera to picture the Moon at the closest point, then at the farthest one, and then compare the sizes. Pretty neat. :)",

Remember when our planet was a dot next to the sun? Well, now the Sun is merely a PIXEL compared to this super-massive giant. So\u2026. wanna get bigger\u2026? WHAT?Aww, look at that wee little thing, isn\u2019t it cute? No, it\u2019s actually terrifying. This is a Quasar Cluster, actually a depiction of a real cluster formed of 73 Quasars. This beast stretches BILLIONS of light years across. In case you don\u2019t know, a light year is how far light travels in a single year. A light year to us is EXTREMELY and absolutely barbaric in size. Seriously. A light year is SO long. This thing is BILLIONS, I repeat, BILLIONS of light years across. Scientists say this cluster is so massive, it defies the mathematics we use on Earth and claims it as \u201ctoo simple for the Quasar Cluster\u201d \u2026..Yep. You guessed it. We\u2019re still growing!This is just a theory, but scientists are assuming that we might be living in something known as a \u201cMultiverse\u201d, which are multiple universes clustered in giant locations. That Quasar clustered listed above would be MICROSCOPIC compared to these giant clusters. Guess what\u2026? We aren\u2019t done.Theories support hints of gamma-radiation being left over from the big bang, traveling between these multiverses, and no technology predicted, could ever reach or see such a MASSIVE scale. If we kept zooming out, we\u2019d reach small white and black clusters that look like germs on a Petri-dish, known as\u2026.. Outer space. Outer space expands faster than LIGHT speed. It is never ending, never stopping, and we can NEVER catch up to the unknown void and darkness that is space.

The Edge Of The Universe Is Closer Than Scientists Previously Thought The visible universe just shrunk by 320 million light-years in all directions, updating a famous calculation that physicists first made 13 years ago. If you're trying to calculate the size of the cosmos, the speed of light \u2014 the fastest anything can go \u2014 is a tempting place to begin and end. You'd reason that since the Big Bang happened some 13.8 billion years ago, there's a 13.8-billion-light-year radius marking the edge of what mere mortals could see. Neutrinos pass through ordinary matter as if it isn't there, so they could have sailed right through the glow of recombination and may offer the earliest-ever view of the universe. But the same reason they could do that also makes them devilishly hard to detect, as any physicist with an underground neutrino-detecting laboratory can attest.10. Historic Supernova Couldn\u2019t Have Been Seen By Humans a bright new star seen in 386 CE, was thought to be the cause of the gorgeous supernova remnant G11.2-0.3, but the latest observations from NASA\u2019s Chandra telescope indicate that this is not the case. Although this supernova formed between 1,400 and 2,400 years ago (from our point of view), it would have been too faint to be visible. Chandra had observed the object in 2000, 2003, and 2013, which allowed the researchers from North Carolina State University and New York University Abu Dhabi to estimate precisely how quickly the nebula left over from the supernova is expanding. In a paper, published in the Astrophysical Journal, the team estimates that the stellar material is moving at a speed between 700 and 1,100 kilometers (435 to 680 miles) per second. It is believed to be one of the youngest known examples of a core-collapse supernova. So the supernova seen in 386 CE goes back to being an unproven observation, but G11.2-0.3 is definitely one for the history books.11. Scientists See How The Seven Sisters Spin The stars of the Pleiades cluster have fascinated and interested humanity for as long as we know. They are mentioned in Japanese documents, in Hinduism, in Islam, in the Bible, and they are even in myths from the Celts, the Aztecs, the Maori, and the Sioux. The cluster was tracked for 72 days, with the rotation of 750 cluster members measured, including 500 of the lowest-mass, dimmest, and smallest stars in the Pleiades. The team discovered that big stars tend to rotate more slowly, with a period between one and 11 Earth days, while many smaller objects rotate in less than a day. By comparison, sunspots near the equator of the Sun rotate in about 26 days. \"In the 'ballet' of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotators tend to be more massive, whereas the fastest rotators tend to be very light stars,\" said Rebull. The Pleiades are located 450 light-years from Earth, and have a rich range of types and masses, with bright blue stars a few times the mass of the Sun to stellar dwarfs 10 percent of our yellow companion. \"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,\" Rebull concluded.12. Stardust Trapped Deep Within The Ocean Reveals A 2.6-Million-Year-Old MysteryA little under three million years ago, a massive star exploded in our galaxy about 300 light years away. This supernova was so close to our planet that, depending on where it went off, our evolutionary ancestors might have seen it as a bright light in the sky. As our solar system traveled through radioactive specks of stardust left over from the explosion, some of the dust broke through our atmosphere and rained down on our planet. Now a recent find from deep within our still-vast ocean is helping us piece together details of a cosmic event that may have changed our planet millions of years ago. Supernova junk in the ocean In 2004, scientists found some of this supernova debris in oceanic crust from the Pacific Ocean. But until now, scientists had a tough time pinpointing exactly how long ago the supernova ejected its insides into space. That\u2019s because the type of ocean crust they found the debris in grows extremely slowly \u2014 about 1 millimeter every million years. In a new study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), scientists were able to figure out how long ago the star exploded and how much time our solar system spent traveling through its stellar guts. Not only was the length of time our solar system spent in the star\u2019s remains surprising, it also coincides with an extinction event in Earth\u2019s oceans, as well as a period of global cooling. Crystal-making bacteria To get these results, the scientists used a different type of ocean sediment from the Pacific Ocean that grows at a rate of 10-20 meters every million years. They were searching for atoms of a radioactive isotope of iron called iron-60. Iron-60 is not produced on Earth, and can only be produced in these massive, exploding stars. In fact, this supernova debris is the first place in the history of our species that we\u2019ve even seen it. 'Our universe is not a friendly place to live' Certain things are very surprising. I love to look in the clear sky in the night when the stars are shining and keep on thinking, how it is so perfectly balanced? This is how the Earth rise above the moon:",

They travel through galactic space, perhaps eventually entering the orbit of another star or even slamming into another planet. These orphan worlds truly live up to the original Greek word planetes- wanderers. There is sound in space\u2026 But only sometimes.It is commonly stated that \u201cthere is no sound in space.\u201d This is because sound waves require some medium, some kind of matter to travel through- whether air, or anything else. If two people were together in a vacuum, they would be unable to hear each other speak. However, there is one situation in which sound waves can travel through space: an explosion, specifically a nova or supernova. In such a case, sound waves can actually travel through the material forced away by the explosion. It doesn\u2019t matter that empty space can't carry sound, since the wave is being carried by an expanding wave of stellar shrapnel. If you could survive a supernova\u2026 in the moment the blast hit, you would hear the sound of a star being torn apart. There are atoms the size of mountains.When a massive enough star reaches the end of its life and goes supernova, its outer layers are blown away and only its core remains. Without the immense pressure of the complete, massive star, the star\u2019s core no longer forces hydrogen atoms (or any others) to undergo fusion, and the star no longer produces any energy. Stars are generally balanced between an immense gravitational force pulling them inward, and the constant process of fusion pushing out. When fusion stops, the star\u2019s gravity suddenly has nothing to keep it in balance- and the star collapses, from a size potentially far larger than our sun, to about 12.5 miles (20 kilometers) across. This titanic amount of pressure forces protons and electrons to combine into neutrons, fusing the star\u2019s atoms together and essentially leaving it as a single atomic nucleus: a neutron star. It is not currently known what is inside a neutron star. It may simply be tightly packed neutrons, it may be some kind of neutron superfluid, or even an entirely unknown state of matter. Space is not empty.Our atmosphere is slowly, but constantly, leaking off into space. This happens on every planet with an atmosphere; as gases are knocked off by solar radiation, pulled away by gravitational forces, or even blown into space by collisions. As a result, outer space is effectively a very thin gas. It is not nearly enough to support most Earthly life, or even to carry sound, but outer space is essentially the outermost layer of the atmosphere. Additionally, it is theorized that a large fraction of the mass of the universe is composed of dark matter: a kind of matter that we have not yet been able to observe directly, but whose effects we can see. Its gravitational effects can be observed in the motion of stars and other bodies, and in its \u201clensing\u201d effect on light (see above picture). And, of course, the observable universe contains countless stars and galaxies; and at least for now, we have no way of knowing how far the universe goes, or if it is in fact infinite. If that is the case, then there are literally infinite galaxies, infinite suns, infinite worlds. But that's not all that there is in space\u2026 Our galaxy is part of a massive intergalactic structure.This is our galactic supercluster, Laniakea. The red dot shows where our galaxy is. This supercluster contains about 100,000 galaxies and stretches 520 million lightyears. The Great Attractor, a supermassive object tens of thousands of times as massive as our galaxy (perhaps a supermassive black hole) is located at the center of the supercluster. Our galaxy, and all other galaxies within millions of lightyears of us, orbit around this single object. And yet our supercluster is just one of many. The Earth orbits the sun, as part of the solar system. Our sun orbits the galactic center, as part of the Milky Way. The Milky Way, our galaxy, orbits the Great Attractor as part of the Laniakea supercluster. Perhaps our galactic supercluster orbits an even more massive object, one which may be hundreds of thousands of times as massive as our galaxy, billions of lightyears away. Our universe is an enormous, incredible place. There is so much that can be discovered, so much we can learn, and so much we can accomplish in our constant quest to uncover the truths of the universe. I hope that people never lose their thirst for knowledge and exploration, and never give up on humanity\u2019s constant attempt to learn what secrets our world holds. The future awaits!",

Spanning a billion light years across, the Eridanus supervoid is very empty of ordinary matter. Dark matter likely is very abundant here, which would prove as an explanation. Seriously, look it up. The void itself looks frightening.3.Everything in the universe will return to its position it is in today in 10^10^10^10^2.08 years, according to the Poincare-Recurrence time. Remember that the universe, if finite, is still that... Finite. There is a limited amount of space matter can move to, and limited shapes, sizes, and different elements that can be put together to form an object. So technically, you just read this fact an infinite amount of times (assuming the universe is finite). 4.Black holes will live longer than the universe. Again, playing on the whole theory of a finite universe with an end, Black holes live for about 10^67 years. That's 10 with 67 zeros after it. According to the heat death, big freeze, and big rip scenarios which are currently the most accepted end-of-the-universe situations, the universe will end in about 25-200 billion years. The Stars will die out, and the only thing roaming the universe when all matter is distorted and the last star in the universe dies will be massive black holes that will roam aimlessly in a cosmic hell. 5.

Scientists say this event only occurs once every 10,000 years, and 2022 is the year this special event takes place. . At 18 million billion kilometers from our Earth, there is a binary star system called KIC 9832227. 2 stars move in the same orbit. Over seven years ago, in 2013, Prof. Molnar and his collaborators, including students from the Apache Point Observatory and the University of Wyoming, observed changes in the luminosity of the star system and also closer distances.It can cause a huge explosion that can also be seen on Earth with the naked eye. This is considered a historic event, a \"once in a thousand years\" opportunity for the people of Earth, with the naked eye, to witness a supernova explosion occurring. In 2017, Professor Lawrence Molnar and scientists from Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan (USA) shared new findings that suggest this binary star system will merge in about five years. The event will cause an outburst of light so intense that it will become the brightest object in the night sky, 600,000 thousand times more powerful than the light of the Sun. This means that although the explosion is 2,000,000 light-years from Earth, it will be the brightest thing in the night sky.The event will cause an intense burst of light 600,000 times stronger than the light of the Sun. This is considered a historic event, a \"once in a thousand years\" opportunity for the people of Earth, with the naked eye, to witness a supernova explosion occurring. Space and the universe have never stopped us from being curious about the mysteries they are storing. The following amazing facts will help you have a new view of this vast universe 1. The Milky Way has a smell and taste In 2009, astronomers discovered a giant cloud of gas and dust at the center of the Milky Way filled with a chemical compound called ethyl formate. Interestingly, ethyl formate smells like rum and is what gives raspberries their flavor.2. ONE DAY ON Mercury 2 YEARS LONG Mercury has a prolonged rotation on its axis, taking about 59 Earth days, but it orbits the Sun fairly quickly, meaning that a year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days. However, because Mercury has a large orbital eccentricity and rotates in the same direction as the Sun, it takes about 176 Earth days to complete a day and night (from sunrise to sunset). If Mercury's rotation around the Sun is one year (like Earth), then one day on this planet is equivalent to 2 years. 3. YOU CAN STILL SURVIVE IN OUTSIDE IF THE PROTECTIVE PATTERNS Leak Unlike the exaggeration of sci-fi movies, you will explode or freeze to death immediately if exposed to outer space without protective gear. In fact, you can still stay alive for a few minutes, even though the feeling won't be very pleasant. Specifically, within 10 seconds, you are still awake enough because the body will use the stored oxygen in the blood. After 10 seconds, the skin and underlying tissues begin to swell as the body's water gradually evaporates in an environment where atmospheric pressure is near zero. Within a minute or two, hypoxia signals death is approaching. The rapid decrease in pressure causes the lungs, eardrums, sinuses, and soft tissues to begin to turn purple and bleed 4. ONE TEAspoon of NEUTRON'S STAR MATERIAL weighs as much as the world's population Neutron stars are one of several possible terminations of stellar evolution, formed from the remains of a massive star's collapse. Because it is composed entirely of many neutrons compressed within an extremely small radius, with just one teaspoon of this star's matter, it would weigh as much as the entire world's population. And to make something as dense as a neutron star, all of humanity would need to fit a small square sugar cube.5. ENERGY FROM GAMMA EXPLOSION Nothing in the universe compares to the power of a gamma-ray burst. What's more, these super-bright flashes, in just 10 seconds, can release as much energy as the Sun emits during its lifetime. Scientists believe that gamma-ray bursts can form during the creation of a black hole, when massive stars explode, or when two neutron stars merge. 6. MANY STARS WE CAN'T SEE Since the Big Bang, most objects in space have moved away from each other. In fact, the expansion of the universe is accelerating. As regions of space move farther and farther apart at an ever-increasing rate, the first stars that formed in the universe are no longer in our field of vision, even with the best telescopes. Current or future best astronomy. We can still hope to see them one day, though, through gamma-ray bursts at the end of a star's life. 7. \"Homeless\" Planets RANGING IN THE UNIVERSITY Not all planets are formed and revolve around a certain star. In fact, astronomers estimate that there may be more than 200 billion planets free-floating in space and possibly passing through our Galaxy.8. WATER FOUND IN SPACE Earth may not be the only place where there is water. The most water ever discovered surrounds a black hole, 140 trillion times the volume of water in Earth's oceans. However, this black hole is about 12 billion light-years away. In addition, scientists think that three of Jupiter's moons (Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) and two of Saturn's moons (Enceladus and Titan) may have water. In it, Europa's ocean can contain twice the amount of water found on our planet. 9. WHITE HOLES On April 10, 2019, the world was amazed at the image of a black hole - a mystery that has fascinated mankind for centuries, finally revealed through a photo taken by EHT (Earth Horizon Telescope). Event). However, the \"brother\" of black holes - white holes, is still a big unknown for scientists. If a black hole is a region where the gravitational field is so strong that nothing can escape, then a white hole won't let anything get inside. Until now, white holes were purely astronomers' assumptions."

He was a French soldier who lived from 1698 to 1807. He\u2019s truly remarkable: He served in the French line infantry for 75 years, 4 months! On September 17, 1716, Thurel enlisted in the French Army and served in the line infantry, and was apparently a good soldier. He first saw action in 1733 at the siege of Kehl against Austria in the War of the Polish Succession. During the battle, he was shot in the chest with a musket\u2026and lived! Not bad. We don\u2019t know much about Thurel in the years following this battle until 1759, during the Battle of Minden in the Seven Years\u2019 War. In this battle, he was slashed in the head by a sword six times\u2026and lived! Impressive, considering Thurel was 61 years old at this time.The Battle of Minden, 1759 After this battle, he was never again injured in combat. Thurel had siblings in the army, too, but they weren\u2019t as lucky as he was: three of his brothers were killed in the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. One of Thurel\u2019s sons was killed in the naval Battle of the Saintes off the coast of Dominica in 1782. Remarkably, Jean Thurel was scolded only one time in his military career, in 1747, during the Siege of Bergen. Apparently, Thurel\u2019s regiment had occupied the city\u2019s citadel, but Thurel fell behind and found himself alone. So, he climbed the citadel walls somehow and entered the citadel the hard way so he wouldn\u2019t miss muster. In 1787, when Thurel was 89, his regiment was marching along the French coast. Due to his age, his officers offered him a carriage to sit in for the march, but Thurel refused and marched the entire distance on foot, claiming that he had never marched by carriage before and had no intention of starting to do so. Also in 1787, Thurel personally met French King Louis XVI (Yes, the same one who was beheaded), who addressed him as \u201cfather\u201d, and granted him a nice pension when he retired in 1792. After Thurel\u2019s retirement in 1792, he eventually met Napoleon, who greatly admired him, in the early 1800s. You might be wondering how far up the ranks Thurel climbed during his 75 year army stint. Thurel was offered a promotion many times, but each time, he refused. He was a private in the French Army for 75 years. That alone is a very remarkable story!",

Sounds innocuous, right? Well, this was no regular stork, it was a stork that had a spear through its body, a Pfeilstorch.Why is this significant? It solved an age old mystery - where migratory birds migrate. For millenia, nobody knew what happened to the storks, swallows and geese during winter, they were numerous during the summer but suddenly vanished when winter creeped in. Many theories were put forward to explain this. Aristotle had some thoughts about it, he suggested that the birds either hibernated or shapeshifted into a more adapted species for the season. However, many were not convinced by Aristotle\u2019s theories and throughout the ages even more explanations appeared. Most infamously, the 1600\u2019s English scientist David Morton hypothesised that the birds migrated to the moon. People just didn\u2019t know. Until the resilient stork of 1822. Once the Pfeilstorch fell people wondered why a spear had impaled the bird. After some research, it turned out that the spear was of African origin which was the first hint for scientists regarding the birds migration. Eager to follow up on this, German ornithologist Johannes Thienemann and his colleagues tagged the legs of around 2000 storks with aluminium rings. The goal with this was that when the storks migrated, people would send back the aluminium rings and tell Thienemann where the stork was captured. The plan was a success and Thienemann got plenty of mails with various locations of where the birds had been found, a large number of them in Africa. Eventually, this helped him discover the first migration route which finally solved the hair-pulling mystery. What blows my mind about this is that such a major discovery was achieved thanks to the resilience of a stork who traveled over 1200 miles impaled. In fact, as of 2003 around 25 pfeilstorchs have been documented in Germany, which further impresses me. Considering such strength, there\u2019s no wonder why people believed they were capable of flying to the moon.",
            "The tenth president of the United States, John Tyler, was a man of many firsts.** John (no middle name) Tyler, the tenth president of the United States With the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, Tyler became the first vice president to assume the Presidency.

Tyler was the first president to be married in office. He had fifteen children, the most of any president. Tyler was the first (and only) president to be buried with a non-U.S. flag draping his coffin. A Confederate flag topped it. When he died in 1862, he was a member of the Confederate House of Representatives. As of this writing (September 21, 2020), John Tyler, a man who died 158 years ago, is the only president born in the 18th century to have grandchildren who are still alive today in the 21st century. Think of that for a second. Tyler was born in 1790, nine years before George Washington died, and has grand kids running around today. OK, they\u2019re not exactly kids anymore, and they probably don\u2019t run much, but you know what I mean. How can this possibly be? I\u2019m glad you asked. President Tyler had eight children with his first wife, Letitia. She died of a stroke while he was in office. Two years later, the 54-year-old president married 24-year-old Julia Gardiner. With her, he fathered an additional seven children. The youngest of these was born in 1860 when Tyler was 70. At this point, he sounds more like Steven Tyler than John Tyler, but I digress. Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Julia\u2019s fourth son, followed in the Tyler family tradition and married for a second time at age 68. He wed Susan Ruffin, who was 35 years his junior. Still with me? Two of Lyon and Sue\u2019s sons, Lyon Jr (born in 1924) and Harrison (born in 1928), are still with us today in 2020, a full 230 years after their famous grandfather was born.** Harrison Ruffin Tyler in 2013. Today he is 92.** Lyon Gardiner Tyler, Jr. Today, he is 96 years old. Let\u2019s give the situation a little perspective. If you were born in 1970, your grand kids would have to be around in the year 2200 to equal the Tyler\u2019s feat. Here is another mind-blowing historical fact: Harrison and Lyon Jr\u2019s father, Lyon Sr., was only eight years old when the American Civil War started. \u2014If you like history, you\u2019ll love my new Space, Snapshots of History.

It shows a partisan being forced to take his hat off to a German officer, and then coming back with a sword and grenades and chopping his head off.So what's so mind-blowing about some old Soviet propaganda? Well, unlike most Soviet propaganda over-glorifying the common soldier with bravery like above, this actually happened: a German officer got his head chopped off by a Soviet, except instead of a sword there was an axe, and the Soviet partisan wasn't holding his grenades, he was throwing them towards 53 German soldiers and officers who surrounding him. This man below is Dmitry OvcharenkoDmitry Ovcharenko was a peasant from the village of Ovcharovo in the Lugansk Region who was horrible at school, in fact, he was so bad at school he was kicked out in year 5. But to make up for his terrible reputation for not being able to cope with school life he was extremely strong, being able to carry pretty much anything. When world war two rolled in, Ovcharenko having already done military training in 1939, was immediately put into the Red Army to fight against the German invaders. His fighting life ended as quickly as it started when he was permanently injured in combat and taken away to work as a supply carrier taking ammo and food from the safe part of the Soviet Union to the front and giving them out.On July 13, 1941, while taking some supplies down a road, Ovcharenko was caught unaware by a German squad of 50 soldiers and three officers. At the end of a gun, he was forced to give his rifle to them and they interrogated him near his carriage with hay, food, and ammo. Unfortunately for the German soldiers, Ovcharenko saw an axe that was in his reach and a couple of grenades hidden in a box full of hay. Within a blink of an eye, he grabbed the axe without so much as a thought and literally, sent the German officer's head flying off his shoulders. What did his men do? Well, they just stood with their mouths open and started trying to process what the hell just happened. I mean you couldn't blame them, they just saw someone whom they respected have his head fly off with a single swing from this random Russkie who was meant to be as much trouble as a scared ant. But unlike his blood-soaked German captors, he barely needed a second to recover from this very bizarre moment. He grabbed the grenades from the box and threw them at the German soldiers. The grenades exploded and killed 20 men while the rest realized how far down the rabbit hole this whole interrogation had gone and simply dropped their weapons and ran towards the nearby woods.But Ovcharenko still wasn't done. Without even thinking about his supply cart, he grabbed his axe and charged towards the retreating Germans. Another German officer, who was now running, turned around to see that Ovcharenko has caught up to him raising his axe and screaming before seeing, well that was it for the second German officer because his head went flying through the air and his body falling down crashing onto the grass spilling a lot of blood on what was his uniform. The other Germans were quite lucky not to lose their heads and went back to camp, where they reported this to their superiors. When Ovcharenko came back to the camp, he was awarded the medal of Hero of the Soviet Union and sent to fight in a machine gun squad. Sadly, he didn\u2019t see the final victory over the Nazis and was killed in Hungary in early 1945.Although this story does look like something out of a cheap Michael Bay movie, there is actually a crap ton of evidence supporting this including the original documents from both sides and scientific evidence supporting these claims."

He cracked civil services exam in 1991 and joined as an IAS. He first hit the national headlines when he literally put his hand on microphones to prevent the then Union home minister, Lal Krishna Advani, from continuing his speech at an election rally in 2004.Gautam Goswami was serving as the DM of Patna and Advani's election rally was going on in Gandhi Maidan. Exactly at 10 PM, Goswami comes on stage and puts his hand over Advani's mic. \u201cSir, your time is up.\u201d The officer told the minister referring to the Election Comission's Model Code of Conduct which proscribed use of Public address system after 10 PM. To this, Advani asks him, \u201cDo you know whom are you talking to?\u201d Goswami replied, \u201cSir, I am just following my duty and I know very well what am I doing.\u201d Times Magazine printed his photo on its cover page and gave a message to many IAS officers about how to follow their duty. Just after 1 year of this, Bihar saw massive floods in 2005. Once again Gautam Goswami did his duty well and due to this Times Magazine awarded him with Asian Young Achiever and he made the headlines once again. But he was alleged for a scam of Rs 18 crores during the flood relief campaign. The chief accused of this scandal was Santosh Jha who was an close ally of Sadhu Yadav, brother-in-law of Lalu Yadav. Sadhu Yadav surrendered himself in the court in December 2006 but he was granted bail after 1 month. But Goswami had to spend 1 year in jail. When released from jail, his health was not well. It was found that he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He lost the battle of life against cancer and left this world at the age of 41. According to his friends , \u201cthere could be a stain on moon, but stains on Goswami's character were unnecessary.\u201d TIME magazine wrote, Goswami\u2019s reputation for upholding the law improves the image of a civil service perceived by many Indians as corrupt or inefficient.

She came into public view after launching a massive drive against corruption and illegal sand mining within her jurisdiction of Gautam Budh Nagar. She was later suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly demolishing an illegal mosque wall in a village in Greater Noida, which resulted in severe opposition as it was perceived to be based on flimsy grounds. There was a growing demand from various political parties, associations of Indian bureaucrats, and by the general public on online social media for her suspension to be revoked.

There are two types of animals. Animals that are useful to humans and animals that are harmful to humans. If a civilization treats both the types of animals with equal love, then that is most probably the best civilization in the world. We have a culture to save animals even at the cost of our lives.

Or, as a Soviet saying put it down, \u201cYou don\u2019t steal from the State, you rob your family\u201d.LONGER ANSWER Up to a certain level, corruption contributes to stability and peace. In Russia, every time someone tried to uproot \u201cthe sources of corruption\u201d, like Lenin\u2019s men in 1917\u20131920, Stalin in the 1930s, and Gorbachev in the 1980s, it all ended in chaos, general misery and suffering for millions. Our modern classic, poet Joseph Brodsky summed up our collective experience: \u201cA crook is closer to my heart than a blood-sucker\u201d. Mind you, he attributed the line to a fictional bureaucrat in Imperial Rome to make it extemporal. (Link to the poem.) Therefore, when someone in the Kremlin starts talking too much about fighting corruption, this makes us Russians feel uneasy. We wouldn\u2019t mind to see some oligarchs\u2019 heads rolling like it was under Stalin. But chance are strong that our lives would then be disrupted too\u2014and it all ends up in tears, once again.Below, a cartoon from the Soviet era. The government servants discuss persistent theft from a state-owned grocery. The congregation wage their fingers at the hapless man with a shotgun. He\u2019s tasked with guarding the premises. \u201cSomeone keeps stealing from our shop once again!\u201dThe trained eye of a Soviet old-timer immediately notices bulging bags with wiener rolls, sausages, and other delicacies tucked under their chairs. These were very irregular items even on the shelves in Moscow, and never seen in retail almost everywhere else in the USSR. This reflected the full-fledged resurgence of tributary taxation in the later decades of Soviet rule. Such low-level corruption was a source of irritation for the mass of commoners of course. But it also cemented cohesion of the giant bureaucratic machine. Once Gorbachev\u2019s men tried to hamstring it, the entire colossus of Soviet rule came undone.Below, Soviet newly-weds come home after their wedding ceremony. True to an old tradition, the groom carries his bride over the threshold of their home. The wife asks her husband nervously if she maybe is too heavy a load for him. The man answers: \u201cNot too heavy for me, honey. I\u2019m used to stealing from my factory way heavier things\u201d.Below, a Soviet man with pals are having quality time at his place. He proudly shows an advanced entertainment center in his living room. In the USSR, we could see gadgets of such sophistication only in advertisements in smuggled Western magazines and shopping catalogues. \u201cMy son put together this all by himself. One piece at a time stolen from the factory\u2014and now it\u2019s truly industry standard.\u201d",

She is living in the Savanah where she has to forage the jungle floors for insects and fruits. Now imagine what shall happen if one day she comes across a tree laden with ripe fruits? What shall be her reaction? Well, her survival instincts shall take over, she shall eat as many fruits as she can lay her hands on, almost to the point of over eating. This is nothing but her natural reaction to the theory \u201cSurvival of the fittest\u201d. Somehow our brains are in the primitive mode even today long after the fruit laden trees have ceased to exist. We need instant calories and quick buck, we are geared towards that. This is the reason why we love junk, fried and fast food and we like to earn quick money, we are hoarders by instincts. Today corrupt people hoard not only for money but also because there is a need to hoard in order to gain power. In today\u2019s time and age, what was once a ripe fruit for a monkey is money to a corrupt person, it is his bargain chip, the power trip and his survival bonus all wrapped into one, Corruption thus is a much naturalised instinct, it is all prevading state where in various modes of survival take over our internal systems.I consider corrupt people as being more animalistic than normal human beings. These are the people who are ruled more by the reptilian brain (limbic brain) and less human brain (Pre-frontal cortex). Couple this problem with a society (Developing country) which still has not been able to fulfill people\u2019s basic needs and want and you have a huge huge problem of power trip associated with corruption. As corruption is no more a hoarding problem, it becomes a power trip, a ticket to supremacy. Anthropologists often say that man destroys nature because evolution happened to us so rapidly that nature couldn\u2019t catch on. We couldn\u2019t understand nature and purposefully trampled on it. This has resulted in us being so casual and uncaring about the consequence of our actions on the society and the whole ecosystem. Thus we have to move from ego to eco. That is where we can see and end to corruption. An ego free society where we don\u2019t have to think about survival by hook or crook, not ruled by our reptilian brain( limbic brain) but our moralistic brain (pre-frontal cortex)P.S. a lot of my friends had requested for a psycho-social analysis of corruption. What i am providing in the answer above is a very minimum and very brief idea, the foundational basis of the research work, I shall be mailing each and every one of my friends (Those who has requested for my analysis) the whole research work, i am also requesting those who want such a report to leave your mail address in the comment section, i shall instruct my team to send mass emailers to all of those people who want to know corruption in its entirity.

Then again, corruption is indulged into for two types of things \u2013 illegal work or legal work. Based on these premises (and a few others) that I have seen during my long experiences with corruption, while working in CBI, while working in Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (twice), as a special counsel for CBI in Supreme Court, as author of a 2200+ pages book on Prevention of Corruption Act, let me explain the main reasons for corruption. While I have mentioned that corruption can be need based or greed based, mostly it is the latter type. In some of the cases, mostly at the lower levels of Government, employees may not be paid well by the Government. They may have family pressure of equalling what the neighbour has, or meeting the ambitions of the family members to have a higher living standard, getting children educated in better schools, some serious health issues in family, a marriage in family, and so on. Plus, if you are posted in a big city (such as Mumbai) and do not have a government house, most of your salary (at the lower levels) may go just for getting a reasonable house on rent for which your HRA may be insufficient. Then, there is peer pressure. If my colleague has motor cycle, why should I not have? My neighbour\u2019s son is in the best school of the town (with high fees), why not mine? So, due to insufficient salary, a need is felt to earn more money. But, from where? Here comes the effect of \u201cpower\u201d that one may have because of being in government. There is an immediate unholy marriage between need and power, and the offspring is corruption. This is what I would call need-based corruption. This is generally at lower levels in the Government. And, generally, the amount of bribe taken is less but the target group from which money is extorted may be mostly from the lower strata of the society, who cannot afford to pay bribes. The second category is greed-based corruption. You are an IAS officer. Boss of a PSU. Or, a senior officer in a powerful ministry. Or, you may be a senior engineer in PWD or electricity department. You may be the RTO, or a senior police officer in IPS. You may be an Income Tax Commissioner hearing an Income Tax assessment case. You may be a Customs or GST officer. You may be a judge. Or, you may be the minister in charge of an economy related ministry. So, you have immense powers and authority to seriously affect the future of a person, a company or any other entity. There may be high financial stakes involved or the life / existence of a person / company may be at stake. The consumer of such government services may also stand to benefit or may avoid some disfavour. So, there is an unholy alliance of the interests of the two sides (sometimes, the consumer side may be forced, and sometimes a willing partner) that result into corruption. This is the greed-based corruption. This is greed-based corruption, from the point of view of the public servant, because his basic livelihood needs for a decent living are already taken care of by reasonable good salary and other perks (such as house, vehicle, etc.) that he may be getting. It is his greed which is propelling such corruption. The greed-based corruption usually happens at the higher and middle levels of the Government. Deals may go even to the level of thousands of crores in some rare cases. Such higher level corruption usually affects the economy and health of the nation. It severally damages the institutions. People lose faith in the government. Even defence of the nation may be risked since many defence deals involve bribes of (hundreds or thousands of) crores of rupees. Most of big government contracts usually involve fixed components of bribes to be paid to different levels of officers. Such higher level corruption attracts most media attention. But, it is difficult to detect such corruption, because both parties are generally equally complicit. Let me now turn to corruption from another angle. It may be caused for getting some legal work done or to seek some illegal favours. You want police verification for your passport, you want your ration card made, you want shop licence, you may need to register property transfer, you may need a driving licence or a commercial driving licence, etc. All these, and many others, may be perfectly lawful things which the government is supposed to do after charging whatever legal fees have been prescribed. The government servants are paid their salaries for doing these specific works. However, they expect bribes for doing even these lawful things. You may have to pay these bribes, willingly or unwillingly, directly or indirectly (through agents). Sometimes, you may not even know that the professional charges that you are paying to, such as a property consultant for registration of transfer of property, may include a bribe component to be paid to the government officer. RTO, Sub-Registrar offices, and many other government departments, have a well-established network of consultants, agents, who collect such bribes in an organised manner in the form of a composite professional fee, which would include bribes to be paid to the government officers concerned. If you don\u2019t pay bribe, even for such lawful purposes, there are hundreds of rules / guidelines that may suddenly be thrust upon you to deny your lawful work too. If nothing else, immense amount of delay may be caused, you may be harassed by calling you again and again, which may frustrate you, compelling to you ultimately pay bribe to avoid inconvenience. The second category is bribe paid for unlawful work. If you have some work which is not permissible under law, or where the discretion exercised by the government servant can be tilted slightly on the other side, you may yourself be willing to pay the bribe. A criminal case is registered against you and you want the police to close the case despite there being evidence. You are running some illegal activities, such as gambling. You have concealed your income from the actual Rs. 1 crore to disclosing only Rs. 10 lakh, and now you do not want the Income Tax officer to raise a demand notice. You want a government bank to give you loan for a business that does not exist or is not business-worthy or for an excessive amount. The situations could be many. If the law does not permit a thing to be done, but you want it to be done, then you may indulge in paying bribe a government servant, who may generally be willing to oblige you for a consideration. Another big category of corruption is pilferage of government funds. Here there may not be a second party offering you the bribe. But, you, as a government officer, have access to government funds and/or government resources. A government doctor may sell medicines meant for free distribution, a PWD engineer may sell the government cement, a FCI officer may sell government wheat, and so on. As I have explained in an earlier answer (Ashok Dhamija's answer to Is it true that every IAS or IPS officer accepts bribe?), many government officers are honest when they join the service, but a corrupt system changes them after several years, though the resistance (to corruption) of each officer would vary. But, most, though not all, would ultimately give in to corruption. In fact, many government officers and employees join the government by payment of bribes in their selection process. Even Public Service Commissions are not untouched in this regard. Media reports, for example, show that even 15-20 years back, people paid in crores for getting appointment as Dy.S.P. in Punjab (selected by Punjab Public Service Commission). Today, the rates would definitely be higher for that level of post. Of course, the rate-card may vary from state to state and post to post. Depending on how lucrative a post is. Now, if someone has joined the government service by paying in lakhs or crores, he would definitely like to recover his investment as soon as possible. In fact, the very fact that someone is willing to pay such huge bribes for appointment to service, would show that he is interested in corruption income more than his salary. One big reason for corruption is multiplicity of complex laws and rules. It may not be possible even for many government officers dealing with such rules to fully comprehend them. A citizen, of course, would not know generally the finer points. So, the government servants misuse the complexity of laws and rules to delay the matters, prolong their decisions, make the process complicated, in order to extract price for smoothening the process. The Government often has no control over its employees. The staff strength is usually insufficient. This also leads to inefficacies and delays, which breed corruption. The all-pervasive character of corruption in all government departments, at all levels, makes it a routine thing. People get used to it. It starts getting acceptance as a way of life. There is no social stigma attached to it. And, a majority of government servants openly indulge in corruption. People have become immune to it. So, it definitely encourages people to become corrupt as they do not see much wrong in it, since it has become an acceptable fact of life. As I pointed out in a previous answer (Ashok Dhamija's answer to Why is corruption in India not considered a national shame?), there are only about 6000 corruption cases registered every year in India as a whole, against crores of corruption transactions occurring every year. This clearly implies that very few people file complaints against demands of bribe by public servants. Who would be scared of corruption, then? Who would be ashamed of corruption, then, if they are never caught or hardly caught? The cost-benefit ratio is skewed heavily in favour of corruption. The benefits are many and cost is generally rare. The CBI and State ACBs are under-staffed. The state ACBs are generally staffed with unwilling police officers (who don\u2019t want transfers from police stations to ACB), so much so that incentive of one-step promotion while being posted in ACB (such as in Maharashtra) is also not found to be sufficient. So, even though a Police Inspector would be given promotion as Dy.S.P. during his posting in ACB, he would not be interested in such posting. Moreover, whosoever is caught taking bribe is not always punished. The judiciary is too slow to act against them. Judiciary is too inefficient. Insufficient judicial strengths and 25% vacancies even in the sanctioned posts of judges further compound the problem. Judgments take years and generally decades. Multiple appeals take further time, in years and decades. So, there is hardly any deterrent. Once you lower or remove the deterrent, government servants will not feel hesitant or scared to accept bribes. So, these are some of the main reasons for corruption. However, what I have mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs is not exhaustive. These are just some indicative reasons. One can do a Ph.D. in this subject, so vast is the list of reasons. The 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, had said:[1]\u201cA man who has never gone to school may steal a freight car; but if he has a university education, he may steal the whole railroad.\u201dA government officer has much more than university education, so you can very well imagine what he can steal if he wants to.Footnotes[1] Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States of America"
