Sometimes I may have given the name of the free version of the app, but mostly the pro-paid version has better features and no ads. I can't add Play Store link to every app so, sorry for that. If you have any suggestion or query just tweet me @ajinkya4793 or comment below.

I\u2019ll give you a laconic explanation for this:TeachingVerbal : Your 80% of lectures would be on verbal which is given by Rahul Singh, who will teach you nothing and will sell you big dreams of IIMs. He\u2019ll only keep boasting about himself that how good he is , I mean what we have to do with that, teach us the damn thing for which we paid money. If you are thinking he will teach you to solve RCs, let me enlighten you. First, he\u2019ll say go home and write about about Natural Sciences, History and Geography. Next lecture, he\u2019ll say, \u201cGood girl, you wrote 10 pages; Bad Boy, you just wrote 5 pages\u201d. Next thing, he\u2019ll say RCs are done, go home and explore more topics and get use to it and RCs are done and dusted from CATKing\u2019s end. Parajumbles : He\u2019ll give you rules which always keep on changing when you ask him doubts, he itself doesn\u2019t have any strong ground base. Grammar : He\u2019ll pick up CR from a particular batch, and ask him to make presentation on it which includes nouns, verbs, adjectives. Are you fking kidding us? We are not planning to appear for SSC school semester. He won\u2019t teach you important stuff like Clauses, Figures of speech, Idioms, Subject Verb agreement, Simple Compound Complex, Type of sentences and how to interpret metaphors as this are the tools to very very important topic for Critical Reasoning, Tone of the passage, complete the statemnet, FIJ and linkage in parajumbles. Loot: He\u2019ll call up top 30 students in 5 Mocks, and say you are smart fellow, you\u2019ll definitely make into IIM A,B,C give us more 15k for Super 30 batch, I\u2019ll give you more attention, I gave and those extra session was complete bullshit, faculty will solve questions as old as 2006\u201308 (only Quantz) and that doesn\u2019t stop there,later he will come up saying your profile is Ass, you won\u2019t make to any colleges as they require versatility(which i agree)\u2026give us more 10k, I will build up your profile by doing case study of HBS. Just for you to know, case study is something that you do research, find disadvantages from given topic, you do your development which is substantiated with demo examples and publish a new paper in some national conference but they will teach you how to make powerpoint presentations. It\u2019s a systematic loot from student by showing them false dreams, it\u2019s our parents hard earn money which you use to buy clothes from Zara. Yes, only 30 students are taught somewhat CAT, baki 200\u2013300 gaye g*nd marane. Behaviour : He is big time flirt and gauche, he\u2019ll keep on flirting with girls and hell with your CAT. He\u2019ll say solve 1 RC and 1 DI, you\u2019ll make to IIM A, how the fuck do you have audacity to say this we can make it by doing 1 RC and 1 DI. Next, Quantitative Aptitude : Number System, Geometry : This 2 topics comprises of 10\u201311 questions in CAT which is completed in classroom in just 1 Lecture. These both topics are so vast that it takes minimum 15\u201320 days to learn from scratch but they are so awesome that they cover in 2 hours Each. PnC, Probabilty : This 2 topics were covered just in 1 hour 45 minutes in 1 webinar which was conducted just 15 days before CAT\u20191 7. Are you guys out of your mind?? 15 days before CAT, who does that which consist of sums : 3 dices are rolled, mailbox-letter, 2 coins are tossed. Major Disappointment. Area, volume and surface areas of circle,triangle. quadrilaterals.cylinders, cones,hemisphere, rectangle ,square, angle bisector, orthocenter, pythagoras, parabolas,etc were covered in just 2 hours. Now guys, you judge, how we are possible to learn this crucial topic in 1 go? Quadratic Equations : no lectures Algebra : no lectures - (modulus, minima-maxima which accounted 3 questions in CAT\u201917) Co-ordinate Geometry : no lectures Next, Logic and DI : Not a single lecture we received on logic, I swear, cross my heart and hope to die DI : Only, 1 lecture which include how to calculate percent growth and decrease. That\u2019s it. Study material : It\u2019s utter bullshit, no quality questions, no detailed solution, Answer keys are 1:6 wrong, distracting changing fonts, 30% questions of logic and DI are from indiabix. Mocks: CATKing mocks have same question since stone age, and CEO of CATking, Rahul thinks, CATKing mocks are better than SIMCATS and AIMCATS. He strictly said not to give any of those as it will lower our moral. But truth is, he wanted student to stay away from reality of what Actual CAT is, as he would become questionable. Comprehensive learning: I was told that portion would be done twice, including advance topic but truth is they won\u2019t even complete it once, i am talking about basic that too 60\u201370%. They will continue to add people in the batch even in the month of August end. You shouldn\u2019t play with anyone\u2019s future for your white collar business. It is easier to fix a broken child than an adult when they realise their dreams are accessory for business. CATKING 2017 Results: IIM A,B, C - None Batch size : 35 students where if there is no place; stand and learn or sit in plastic chair. AC makes garrulous sound which doesn\u2019t even allow to concentrate. Workshop goes around 200 students. We were lured once by saying that they will provide most repetitive question in past 5 years of CAT but instead we were called to do his class publicity on Independence Day, there was photographer, bulletin board but no serious teaching that a student requires. We were made to scream out our throats to record their videos for god sake. Webinars : There would be session on how to crack GDPI post all exams are over, I wonder who sits in their webinars. FYI, It\u2019s CISCO Webex application, in which your personal data like email id and phone number is passed to Athena, Bocconi, Wellingkar who sponsors one way or other. Red Alert : One Zuckerberg in Mumbai. Faculty:There is only 1 verbal faculty i.e. Rahul Singh, and you are strictly not allowed to call him or text him when you have doubts after lecture. If a student is studying and revising what taught in class, obviously, he will ask question, he\u2019ll call multiple times, he\u2019ll be after you as that is your fucking job but no, he is more busy person than SRK, infact he also replies to your tweets.Quantz: If you know anything after that you\u2019ll have any doubts. If you don\u2019t get any proper lectures, you don\u2019t know any shit, you end up feeling like Darsheel Safari in Taare Zameen Par.Logic/ DI : 404: Faculty not foundConclusion: If you already a CATKing Student, my advice is go to their coaching institute and ask for refund, you\u2019ll cry blood, 1 month before CAT. Trust me. You\u2019ll waste 1 whole year, age is not a number, do you want to feel like senior citizen among other IIMs student. Resolution: Tension mat lo, bhai aya hai bata k jayega, Join IMS or CL if you\u2019re serious about your future. Engineers, you cleared microprocessor subject in your engineeirng in 1st Attempt, you are legend itself, you don\u2019t require any coaching, get Hunda Ka Funda or Arun Sharma, it will suffice. Please don\u2019t fall for positive reviews of CATking in Quora, those are fake, paid publicity of classes is done here, if you don\u2019t trust me, check the bio of person who answered, it won\u2019t contain any credibility tags of any IIMs or top B-school that person belongs to. ALL THE BEST FOLKS!!",

He claims all the lies, I personally pinged one of his students by stalking(sorry to say) her profile on FB and messaging her. She said; On point Blank \u2013 No. She has not been in CATKing, she used to study in IMS. She has no clue, how her name Rahul Singh is mentioning it. DI \u2013 LR: No Lectures July- Again repetition of Norman lewis what we have already done, Saying it would be a quick revision. Again reptition of Percentages, profit loss, averages, SI CI \u2013 Those same question which were so cheap like him and easy. New students are added to same old batch, and people of old batch are been taught the same thing again and again. DI -LR : No lectures August \u2013 Start giving mocks. If you consecutively ranking under top 30. Pay extra 12,000 for super 30 batch, as part of marketing gimmicks. Also, Students who have joined in July are asked to give mocks who doesn\u2019t know anything. In fact, batch of April and July are stands no chance. I\u2019ll cover brief introduction on Mocks as we move ahead. Normal Lewis \u2013 2 weeks of August. Third Week, he\u2019ll ask to make 10 topics over humanity, science, Darwin, etc and would say. Good job buddy, you wrote 25 pages on 7 topics. You fool girl, you wrote on 2 pages. You idiot, you have not written anything, don\u2019t come crying in October. But He has still not touch how to solve reading comprehension. DI \u2013 LR : Sequence and numbers, Sense directions September: He will solve only 1 passage in first week and he will disappear till month of January. You won\u2019t see him at all. Quants : 2 hours \u2013 Number System 2 hours : Algebra 2 hours: Geometry 2 hours : Time speed distance. 4 weeks \u2013 four 2 hours lectures for these crucial topics. Even though these topics are not covered, he\u2019ll still ask to solve mocks in month of August. October: Online webinar on permutation and combinations for 1 hour. Take any catking student and ask him if I am telling lies. 1 hour lecture on para jumbles. After that, your journey is over with Catking November: Laughing out loud, They would act as if there are no such classes like CATking exist. No one will pick up your phone, nor they will answer your messages. Like Phir Hera Pheri. +++Mocks+++++ Even we know how to put screenshot. It goes as follow: -  This are the level of questions asked in DI-LR mocks, he will not tell you that there things like Case-lets. One of my friend told him about SIMCATS and AIMCATS. He started abusing him, saying Ch*tiya, Don\u2019t come to my classes then, go there. My mocks are better than SIMCATS, AIMCATS, HITBULLSEYES. He wanted people to stay away from Reality. He kept us in the Dark. +++Talking about Quantz+++ Just to be sure, This are CATKING mocks++++++Additional Factual information++++ None of the students have cleared cat and made their way to any top IIMS. catking students max goes up to NMIMS Banglore and Wellingkar. CATking uses fake publicity to maximize the pages hit on classes. I know everyone on them Disha shukla, Sahil sir, Karan sir, Rahul, Anisha, Radhika Sule, Neha. These are CATKing Team. All are playing careers of children for 30,000 rupees. That\u2019s their level. All the screenshot that Rahul and Anisha\u2019s posts are fake. Now, people who reading this post are the one who are going to be manager. He has money, he pays of people to write positive reviews, catking pays of people to chat with him about interviews. catking has money to shut the people out. Everything is fake, even his name: Sumit Gandhi, not Rahul Singh Rahul singh don\u2019t have degree from Havard business school. Listen his story. Done is engineering from NIT, went for GRE with score 331, then went to SP jain, then went to Havard business school then went to China to work. Does this makes sense. How SP jain would take a person with MS degree. Karma looks everything, Its our parents hard earn money. That people use for Paris Trips. Conclusion: Join IMS, TIME, Career Launcher. Point Blank. The reason I am saying that because they have a strong foundation with faculties who are in position of epitome of aptitude training. They start mocks by April, with proctored solution and question are at Par with CAT. All the best Folks!!",

I\u2019ll give you a laconic explanation for this:TeachingVerbal : Your 80% of lectures would be on verbal which is given by Rahul Singh, who will teach you nothing and will sell you big dreams of IIMs. He\u2019ll only keep boasting about himself that how good he is , I mean what we have to do with that, teach us the damn thing for which we paid money. If you are thinking he will teach you to solve RCs, let me enlighten you. First, he\u2019ll say go home and write about about Natural Sciences, History and Geography. Next lecture, he\u2019ll say, \u201cGood girl, you wrote 10 pages; Bad Boy, you just wrote 5 pages\u201d. Next thing, he\u2019ll say RCs are done, go home and explore more topics and get use to it and RCs are done and dusted from CATKing\u2019s end. Parajumbles : He\u2019ll give you rules which always keep on changing when you ask him doubts, he itself doesn\u2019t have any strong ground base. Grammar : He\u2019ll pick up CR from a particular batch, and ask him to make presentation on it which includes nouns, verbs, adjectives. Are you fking kidding us? We are not planning to appear for SSC school semester. He won\u2019t teach you important stuff like Clauses, Figures of speech, Idioms, Subject Verb agreement, Simple Compound Complex, Type of sentences and how to interpret metaphors as this are the tools to very very important topic for Critical Reasoning, Tone of the passage, complete the statemnet, FIJ and linkage in parajumbles. Loot: He\u2019ll call up top 30 students in 5 Mocks, and say you are smart fellow, you\u2019ll definitely make into IIM A,B,C give us more 15k for Super 30 batch, I\u2019ll give you more attention, I gave and those extra session was complete bullshit, faculty will solve questions as old as 2006\u201308 (only Quantz) and that doesn\u2019t stop there,later he will come up saying your profile is Ass, you won\u2019t make to any colleges as they require versatility(which i agree)\u2026give us more 10k, I will build up your profile by doing case study of HBS. Just for you to know, case study is something that you do research, find disadvantages from given topic, you do your development which is substantiated with demo examples and publish a new paper in some national conference but they will teach you how to make powerpoint presentations. It\u2019s a systematic loot from student by showing them false dreams, it\u2019s our parents hard earn money which you use to buy clothes from Zara. Yes, only 30 students are taught somewhat CAT, baki 200\u2013300 gaye g*nd marane. Behaviour : He is big time flirt and gauche, he\u2019ll keep on flirting with girls and hell with your CAT. He\u2019ll say solve 1 RC and 1 DI, you\u2019ll make to IIM A, how the fuck do you have audacity to say this we can make it by doing 1 RC and 1 DI. Next, Quantitative Aptitude : Number System, Geometry : This 2 topics comprises of 10\u201311 questions in CAT which is completed in classroom in just 1 Lecture. These both topics are so vast that it takes minimum 15\u201320 days to learn from scratch but they are so awesome that they cover in 2 hours Each. PnC, Probabilty : This 2 topics were covered just in 1 hour 45 minutes in 1 webinar which was conducted just 15 days before CAT\u20191 7. Are you guys out of your mind?? 15 days before CAT, who does that which consist of sums : 3 dices are rolled, mailbox-letter, 2 coins are tossed. Major Disappointment. Area, volume and surface areas of circle,triangle. quadrilaterals.cylinders, cones,hemisphere, rectangle ,square, angle bisector, orthocenter, pythagoras, parabolas,etc were covered in just 2 hours. Now guys, you judge, how we are possible to learn this crucial topic in 1 go? Quadratic Equations : no lectures Algebra : no lectures - (modulus, minima-maxima which accounted 3 questions in CAT\u201917) Co-ordinate Geometry : no lectures Next, Logic and DI : Not a single lecture we received on logic, I swear, cross my heart and hope to die DI : Only, 1 lecture which include how to calculate percent growth and decrease. That\u2019s it. Study material : It\u2019s utter bullshit, no quality questions, no detailed solution, Answer keys are 1:6 wrong, distracting changing fonts, 30% questions of logic and DI are from indiabix. Mocks: CATKing mocks have same question since stone age, and CEO of CATking, Rahul thinks, CATKing mocks are better than SIMCATS and AIMCATS. He strictly said not to give any of those as it will lower our moral. But truth is, he wanted student to stay away from reality of what Actual CAT is, as he would become questionable. Comprehensive learning: I was told that portion would be done twice, including advance topic but truth is they won\u2019t even complete it once, i am talking about basic that too 60\u201370%. They will continue to add people in the batch even in the month of August end. You shouldn\u2019t play with anyone\u2019s future for your white collar business. It is easier to fix a broken child than an adult when they realise their dreams are accessory for business. CATKING 2017 Results: IIM A,B, C - None Batch size : 35 students where if there is no place; stand and learn or sit in plastic chair. AC makes garrulous sound which doesn\u2019t even allow to concentrate. Workshop goes around 200 students. We were lured once by saying that they will provide most repetitive question in past 5 years of CAT but instead we were called to do his class publicity on Independence Day, there was photographer, bulletin board but no serious teaching that a student requires. We were made to scream out our throats to record their videos for god sake. Webinars : There would be session on how to crack GDPI post all exams are over, I wonder who sits in their webinars. FYI, It\u2019s CISCO Webex application, in which your personal data like email id and phone number is passed to Athena, Bocconi, Wellingkar who sponsors one way or other. Red Alert : One Zuckerberg in Mumbai. Faculty:There is only 1 verbal faculty i.e. Rahul Singh, and you are strictly not allowed to call him or text him when you have doubts after lecture. If a student is studying and revising what taught in class, obviously, he will ask question, he\u2019ll call multiple times, he\u2019ll be after you as that is your fucking job but no, he is more busy person than SRK, infact he also replies to your tweets.Quantz: If you know anything after that you\u2019ll have any doubts. If you don\u2019t get any proper lectures, you don\u2019t know any shit, you end up feeling like Darsheel Safari in Taare Zameen Par.Logic/ DI : 404: Faculty not foundConclusion: If you already a CATKing Student, my advice is go to their coaching institute and ask for refund, you\u2019ll cry blood, 1 month before CAT. Trust me. You\u2019ll waste 1 whole year, age is not a number, do you want to feel like senior citizen among other IIMs student. Resolution: Tension mat lo, bhai aya hai bata k jayega, Join IMS or CL if you\u2019re serious about your future. Engineers, you cleared microprocessor subject in your engineeirng in 1st Attempt, you are legend itself, you don\u2019t require any coaching, get Hunda Ka Funda or Arun Sharma, it will suffice. Please don\u2019t fall for positive reviews of CATking in Quora, those are fake, paid publicity of classes is done here, if you don\u2019t trust me, check the bio of person who answered, it won\u2019t contain any credibility tags of any IIMs or top B-school that person belongs to.

Not THE John Nash, the Nobel Prize winner who also had schizophrenia. But his son, who was a very strong player. We would go over to his house (where his father and mother also lived) and play all day and then I would go home before my parents got home from work.

Not THE John Nash, the Nobel Prize winner who also had schizophrenia. But his son, who was a very strong player. We would go over to his house (where his father and mother also lived) and play all day and then I would go home before my parents got home from work. The son also had schizophrenia and I sort of could tell but we focused our days on playing chess all day. At the time, I didn't know who his father was.This was a family of brilliant people. His son was a strong chess master. The father was a Nobel Prize winner. Maybe that makes them mentally strong. Maybe not. John, the son, disappeared and we lost touch. I last saw him I think in 1988.Since then I've met a lot of incredibly brilliant people. Because of my podcast and businesses I've been involved in I've met some of the smartest people, some of the most successful people, some of the most brilliant people in the world. Maybe they are mentally strong. Maybe not. Often many of us are very good at constructing masks and it is never really known what is deep inside of us. What we keep hidden for fear of death if others were to find out. But I can tell you what is most in common with some of the people I have encountered and maybe then you can tell me if you think these are qualities of mentally strong people. I would like to know. All of these things...anyone can do. Anyone can learn to be mentally strong and change the world as a result. Wealth, health, success, strong relationships, and freedom seem to be byproducts of the traits listed below. Here's my trick: I list, for each item, 1-10 on where I rank and then I add them up. So somewhere between 0 and 100. Then every day I try to improve by 1. A) RELATIONSHIPS The mentally strong people I know, the ones who have achieved the most in life, have ALL had incredibly strong relationships. Friends, spouses, partners, and so on. I've interviewed billionaires, well known movie directors, athletes, scientists, artists. All have believed in the saying \"you are the average of the five people you spend your time with\". If you build up strong relationships, it means they are supporting your ideas, adding to them, helping you execute them, and not constantly fighting you or dragging you down. B) HONESTY This is not religious but math. The brain takes up 2% of the body's mass and burns up 25% of the body's calories each day. One in four calories you eat goes to fuel your brain. When you lie, one side of your brain has to deal with one set of lies. And the other side of the brain has to deal with the other set of lies. So to be at optimal mental strength you now need twice as many calories. This is impossible. So the best way to be mentally strong is to be honest so all of the fuel in your body can be used efficiently at propelling your brain from strength to strength instead of fighting off the attacks on your weaknesses. C) IT'S NOT ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT YOU Whenever a girl broke up with me, it never seemed to be about me. That's ok. That was a line to make me feel better. I guess I should be grateful for the many people who tried to make me feel better by blaming themselves. But true mentally strong people constantly are focused on others. They are solving problems for other people. They don't think, \"How can I make money\" since money is just pieces of paper fueled by a mythological story. They think, \"What are problems in the world that I can solve?\" They think, for instance, healthcare is a mess. And since we all know \"prevention is the cure\", how can I develop a product that helps with prevention and diagnostics. And, if you were a genius like Elizabeth Holmes, you would drop out of Stanford, make a company called Theranos, and do exactly that. That is just one example. Mentally strong people are always solving other people's problems. The problems of the individual get solved as a byproduct of solving the problems of the many. D) READING I've interviewed over 150 people now for my podcast. Here is one question nobody ever hesitates on: What are the last books you've read? Do you know why mentally strong people read? I have my guess. We all have one life to live. But when you read, you get to absorb the curated life of another person in just a few days. So if you read a lot, your one brain can hold onto the critical points of potentially thousands of other incredible people. You can bathe in their lives and come out a stronger you. I asked Freeway Rick Ross, the largest drug dealer ever, what books he read in prison that turned around his life. He couldn't read or write before prison. But then he taught himself. He told me instantly: \"As A Man Thinketh\", \"The Richest Man in Babylon\", and \"Think and Grow Rich\". I asked Tim Ferriss, author of The Four Hour Work Week. He said, \"Radical Acceptance\", \"Essentialism\", and \"The Effective Executive\". All 150 people I have interviewed gave answers instantly. I have no doubt if I ask them again next week they will all have different answers. I have never met a mentally strong person who wasn't a voracious reader. E) HEALTH Because the brain burns so many calories, you have to have health in other areas of your life. It's hard to be mentally strong, to be creative, to execute, to change the world, if you are sick in bed. This is not being judgmental towards those sick in bed. Sometimes we just get sick. We can't help it. But almost everyone I've ever dealt with in business or in life who has gone on to greater and great successes all acknowledged the importance of constant healthy transformation of their bodies. This doesn't mean lift 500 pounds. It means sleep eight hours a day. It means eat well (which simply means: less on processed foods, more on vegetables, and exchange your 15 inch plates for 10 inch plates), and move. Movement doesn't mean running a marathon. It might just mean walking a lot. Our paleo ancestors got their exercise from walking and climbing on their daily hunt for food. This kept them healthy enough to be our ancestors so I thank them every day for that by following their model. F) CURIOSITY If you are talking to someone and they say something interesting but you don't understand, do you interrupt them and ask them what they mean?I often don't. And then what happens? Then, for the rest of my life, I will never understand what they mean. Sometimes I'm afraid to ask questions because I don't want to seem stupid or I don't want someone to be annoyed at me or I'm feeling shy. The only way to learn new things is to ask questions and be curious. Find the people who inspire your curiosity because those are the ones you will most learn from. Then ask them questions. The more stupid you feel asking a question, the more you HAVE to ask the question. If you feel shy asking one question, then ask TWO questions. Every mentally strong person has this one thing in common: the things they most remember that has changed their lives have been the answers to questions they asked. If they never asked those questions, their lives would not have changed. G) LEARN, SAY, REPEAT We think we learn in school. We take a class and a brilliant professor gives a lecture and we supposedly leave the class smarter. But here is the science. Within 45 minutes of leaving a class, college students have already forgotten 80% of what was said in the class. By the next day, they have forgotten just about 100%. Here's how to remember: First you hear something. If it interests you, write it down as a note (carry a notebook. I carry a waiter's pad because they are cheap). Then use it in a conversation within an hour. Then use it in a conversation the next day and then the next. NOW there is a decent chance you have learned it. Because you build various connections in your brain that have now been programmed with that nugget of information. That's how learning takes place. Mentally strong people learn how to learn. H) THE IDEA MUSCLE People say \"ideas are a dime a dozen\". This is simply not true. Ideas are \"a dime for three\". Go ahead and try. Come up with 10 ideas for surprises for your spouse's next anniversary. The first three are easy. But, for me, then it gets harder and by #7 I'm counting the list over and over again to see if I reached 10.Ideas are a muscle that need to be exercised. If you get hit by a bike and are stuck in bed for two weeks recovering, then when you leave the bed your leg muscles are so atrophied you need therapy to walk again. The same with the idea muscle. It needs to be exercised every day or it will atrophy. How do you exercise it? Pick a theme, any theme will do, and write down ten ideas a day. Every day. I can tell you that when I was broke and suicidal and scared I started doing this. My life has changed 100% every six months since then. It's been incredible. Like magic. I wrote this and shared this with others. Now I get emails from people every six months telling me how their lives have changed. When I was interviewing the rapper Coolio he told me he wrote lyrics down every day for 17 years before he had his first hit. A year after his first hit he had the best selling song on the entire planet. When he described that song to me he described which elements from which musicians who came before him that he meshed together to create his hit. This is called \"idea sex\". When you are an expert in one category and an expert in another then you are the greatest in the world at the intersection.Exercising the idea muscle, plus learning, plus idea sex, will make you be the best in the world at whatever you aim. What about execution? Execution ideas are just a subset of regular ideas. If you have an idea you want to execute on, then your idea list the next day should be, \"What are the ten next steps I need to take?\" Should you then take them? I don't know. Mentally strong people probably make those lists 100 times a year and only need to execute on one of them to change the world. Give yourself permission to have bad ideas. It's only through diligent mining of the universe inside of you that you find the gems that will light up the world. I) PERMISSION Mentally strong people give themselves permission. Why did the Google guys come up with the 8th search engine and think theirs was special? Why did Elizabeth Holmes think it was ok to drop out of the best school in the country to pursue a business dream? Why did Henry Ford, after failing twice at car companies, think it was a good idea to start a third car company. Why did the Wright Brothers think it was ok to make a plane with spare parts from their bicycle shop when the government was spending tens of millions? They all gave themselves permission to do something that has never been done before. They all gave themselves permission to have many bad ideas. They all gave themselves permission to risk their reputation and the forked tongues of the people who would fight them. They gave themselves permission to slip and fall and get up and dust themselves off and try again. And again. And again. And again. They gave themselves permission to love something so strong that every neuron on their brain would light up and conspire to make their dreams come true. If you don't give yourself permission to create a new world, chances are nobody else will. J) PRESENCE I regret so many things from my past. Maybe that one time I lost all of my money, I could've used it to help my father live a little bit longer than he did.Maybe I could've held onto my house. Maybe I could've been smarter about business. And all of the time I am anxious. Will I give a good speech. Will this business I invest in work out? I hope it does. I don't want to go broke again.But whenever you regret the past, or are anxious about the future, you are time traveling. Time traveling seems exciting but it isn't. You can time travel all your life and then suddenly you are dead without ever having lived in the present moment, the only moment that exists. Whenever mentally strong people find themselves time traveling they take a step back. They said, \"What can I do right now to help others\" instead of wasting time regretting the past or worrying about the future. Worry and regret never solves tomorrow's problems and only drains away energy from today. Presence will always solve this moment's problems. Mentally strong people solve problems, love people, are curious, stay healthy, have idea sex, are honest with you, and make the world a better place. I hope each day I can improve a little on each level. And if I run into you on the street, maybe we can wink at each other. We're on the same team.",

Knowledge builds up, like compound interest says Warren Buffett. And he couldn't have said that any better. You get to cash in when the time is right. All of us can build our knowledge but most of us won\u2019t put in the effort. We all differ in our abilities to solve problems, learn, think logically, understand and acquire new knowledge, integrate ideas, attain goals, and so on. But when you put your mind to it, you will work better, smarter and faster. Intelligence is always work in progress so you are never too late to add to what you already know. The good news is, you don\u2019t have to learn everything in hours, days or even months. The focus should always be on progress. The simplest, most direct way to be smart is to build deep knowledge about things you care about. Building knowledge of an area improves your memory, thinking, and decisions about that topic. You can gain knowledge faster about a topic you care deeply about than a random topic. But if they are not really the kinds of things you are interested in, then you will be hard pressed to devote time and effort to learn much. One thing that most people seem to agree on is that reading is near the core of how to be smart.  Don't get in the way of your own learning. Most people don't really think much about how they learn. The world is changing fast and new ideas pop up everyday; incorporating them into your life will keep you engaged and relevant. It pays to crave and keep an open mind. Incredibly smart people aren't always born that way, but rather are constantly working to improve their intelligence. You have every opportunity to improve and enhance your way of thinking. Choose smart and stay curious.These are a few of the many things you can consistently do everyday to get smarter. 1. Be curious about almost everything. Some people are naturally curious and others are not. Your learning does not stop at school, college or your job. There is nothing that can beat a curious mind.\u201cI have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.\u201d -Albert Einstein 2. Be willing to try new things. Here is a short fascinating story of Steve Jobs's youthful calligraphy class. After dropping out of school, the future Apple founder had a lot of time on his hands and wandered into a calligraphy course. It seemed irrelevant at the time, but the design skills he learned were later baked into the first Macs. The takeaway: You never know what will be useful ahead of time. You just need to try new things and wait to see how they connect with the rest of your experiences later on.\"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future,\". In order to have dots to connect, you need to be willing to try new things. 3. Try a new better, faster or smarter routine. It pays to break some of your routines sometimes.  Try consciously breaking one of your habits, just for a moment. Eat a different breakfast. Take a different route to work. Sleep in the opposite direction. Read fiction. Get out of your comfort zone once a while. 4. Expose yourself to different world views. Be genuinely curious about other cultures, languages or how things are done differently by others. Different cultures could have a big positive effect on your own ideas. 5. Get fascinated. If you can\u2019t get fascinated, you won\u2019t care enough to really learn something. You\u2019ll just go through the motions. How do you get fascinated? Often doing something with or for other people helps to motivate me to look more deeply into something, and reading about other people who have been successful/legendary at it also fascinates me. 6. Reflect on your learning by blogging. You soak up a ton of information and patterns, and you can put that into action, but when you sit down and reflect on what you\u2019ve learned, and try to share that with others (as I\u2019m doing right now), you force yourself to think deeply, to synthesize the knowledge and to organize it, much as you do when you teach it to others. Blogging is a great tool for reflection and sharing what you\u2019ve learned, even if you don\u2019t hope to make a living at it. And it\u2019s free. 7. Do it, in small steps. Actually doing whatever you want to do will be scary. You can learn as much Spanish vocabulary as you like, but until you start having conversations, you won\u2019t really know it. You can read as much about chess as you like, but you have to put the problems into action, and play games. You can read about how to program, but you won\u2019t know it until you actually code. Start with small, non-scary steps, with as little risk as possible, focusing on fun, easy skills. 8. Feel free to move around. I will dive into something for a couple weeks, and then move on to something else. That\u2019s OK. That\u2019s how passion for a topic often works. Sometimes it will last for a long time, sometimes it\u2019s a short intense burst. You can\u2019t control it. Allow yourself to wander if that\u2019s where things lead you.

            "Yes, there is a potential danger in standing near or looking into a microwave oven while it is on. Microwave ovens emit microwave radiation to cook food, and this radiation can be harmful to humans if they are exposed to high levels. The design of microwave ovens includes safety features to prevent radiation leakage, but it's still recommended to maintain a safe distance from the oven while it's in operation and to never look directly into it to minimize any potential risk.",

Not radiation burns. Not chemical burns. But real, old-fashioned heat burns. Moreover, even if the microwave leaked prodigiously, you would feel the heat forming in your skin within the first seconds. Which of course, would make you withdraw from the oven very quickly. Which would of course, limit the amount of injury, if any, that you would sustain.

I was flying from the states to the Middle East for a job interview. My connecting flight was little late and when I arrived at the gate the boarding had already started: first class passengers had already entered, and now economy class was boarding. Reaching my first class seat, I was surprised to see an old man already sitting in it. I showed the gentleman my seat on my boarding pass, but he didn't understand and simply looked away. Next, I turned to the flight attendant, who said, \u201cYeah, I saw he wasn\u2019t in his seat\u2014I'm waiting for two male flight attendants to come carry him to his seat in economy class.\u201d Then I looked closer and realized that that gentleman in my seat had medical issues, was elderly, and couldn't walk without help. I told her \u201cnever mind, just give me his seat in economy class. I\u2019ll take that,\u201d and off I went to economy class. An hour later, when the seat belts signs were turned off, I saw the flight attendant pointing her finger at me while talking to a man. The man approached me and said, \u201cWhat you did right there was really a great thing.\u201d \u201cWho are you ?\u201d To which he replied, \u201cI'm sitting right next to the elderly man that you gave up your seat to.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d He continued. \u201cThat old man in your first class seat has no idea what you did for him: he doesn't know someone gave up a seat for him\u2014and\u2014paid a lot for that.\u201d Eager to get back to my inflight entertainment, I again said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Writing his phone number on the back of his business card, he surprised me by handing it to me. \u201cHere\u2019s my business card.\u201d \u201cThanks,\u201d was my reply, and he returned to his seat. My interview that day which I had traveled to for so long didn't work out. I Googled the business card the second man had given me while I was in my hotel room, waiting for a flight back home, and I discovered they did the same type of work as the company that had been interviewing me.

Actually first one side of my neck, then shifting over to the other side and resuming his kisses there. Then back over to where he started. It took this human a while before she realized he was trying to nurse on my neck! The more I hold still, the more he wants to keep doing it!

On multiple occasions, instead of this, I would wake up to Geordi - who was a pretty big guy - lying on my chest, nudging me with his nose to wake up. His weight was soothing. He would stay there until I calmed down, then simply hop down and walk away. The ONLY time he ever did this was when I was in the middle of a horrible nightmare - I couldn\u2019t pay him to lay on my chest in bed otherwise. To this day, I have no idea how he could tell what was happening. My husband says I don\u2019t talk in my sleep, thrash around, or cry out, but somehow this cat knew I needed help.

One day, after the chicken baby food on a stick/spoon ritual, he paused, looked at me, and did this long meow. Never could I describe it, just thinking about the moment gives me chillbumps. Then he came out of his hiding place and beckoned to me, putting his front paws through the cage, to pet him. He has trusted me, completely, utterly, ever since. He hides from everyone else.

The temperature was 104 degrees and she let me know she was dying. Without a second thought, I swooped her up and brought her home. I\u2019d always been a cat lover, but this little girl had a highly developed ability to sense trouble and alerted me to it whenever she knew I was oblivious to a threatening situation or person within my home. She became my little girl. I learned to trust her instincts and relied upon her ability to convey her warnings with great clarity and accuracy. The winter she turned five and I forty-nine, I began slipping into a depression both mentally and physically. Throughout the first month she remained close by me and demonstrated her concern and support. The beginning of my second month of decline, she began smelling my breath numerous times throughout each day and gently prodded and smelled my body parts with keen interest. One week into the third month of this activity she became singularly focused on my right breast and began pouncing on a specific spot whenever I was in a reclined position or sleeping. Her ritual pouncing on my breast and awakening me from sleep was irritating and I began pushing her off me and yelling at her in anger while ignoring her as punishment; something I\u2019d never done before. Surprisingly, this only served as a signal for her to double down on her behavior and sleep attacks. I awoke late one night to find her sitting directly on top of my right breast and staring deep into my eyes; and finally I understood her warning clearly as if she spoke the words; you have breast cancer and I found it for you. I sat up and began hugging her to show her I finally understood. She remained beside me throughout that dark night until morning light signaled us it was time for me to handle this threat to my life. Forty days later I underwent surgery for a double mastectomy. Three different forms of breast cancer had been discovered growing inside the milk tubes of both my breast; all stage one cancers with one small tumor that was the beginning efforts of the cancer\u2019s spread exactly where she had shown me. Long ago I saved a little black kitten from certain death, and she rewarded me by saving my life in return. Her name was Kit-Kat and though she passed over the rainbow \ud83c\udf08 ten years ago, she remains in my heart, mind and soul forever."

The orientation of fluid provides information on how the body is oriented.Somatosensory aka \u201ctouch\u201dMechanoreceptorsFast or Slow AdaptationLarge or Small field SizeCombining to 4 different types of senses using the combinations aboveMerkel\u2019s Disks are slow-adapting with small receptive fields, they respond to light pressure to pinpoint a stimulus.Meisnner\u2019s Corpules are fast adapting and respond to light pressure and low-frequency vibration (50Hz).Bulbous Corpuscles (or Ruffini) are Slow-Adapting and located deeper in the skin. They respond to skin stretching and deformations in the joints. The feedback is also used in proprioception (that comes later) and they also respond to heat (due to the depth you will feel heat later than cold).Pacanian Corpuscles are fast-adapting and also located deeper in the skin, bones, joints, pancreas, breasts, and genitals. They respond to deep but short-lasting pressure and high-frequency vibration (200\u2013300Hz).ThermoreceptorsHeat Decreases or Heat IncreasesThere are two separate receptors that respond to temerature increases and dropsNocireceptorsAcute of ChronicTolerable of IntolerableNocireceptors come in various shapes and sizes that can respond to Mechanical stimulation (too much pressure, deformation, or breaking the skin), Thermal Nocireceptors respond to exceeding a certain temperature threshold (both hot and cold), and Chemical Nocireceptors respond to various chemicals (think Capsaicin in hot peppers).Itch is a bit of an unknown, some cases of itch seems to be caused by Insensitive Nocireceptors (the ones above are mainly sensitive), especially when histamine is involved (think allergies). But we also Itch without a histamine response, so still working on that one.Taste has been misunderstood for a long time, remember that diagram of the tongue showing the 4 taste zones? yeah, completely wrong. Taste is a combination of the chemo-receptors in the tongue, chemoreceptors in the nose (aka smell), mechanoreceptors for texture, and thermoreceptors for temperature (and chemical nocireceptors for \u201chotness\u201d and \u201ccoolness\u201d in things like peppers and menthol). Our five subcategories for this are:SweetnessSaltinessSournessBitternessUmamiProprioception is the sense of your own body, it\u2019s how you are able to touch your nose with your eyes closed.Then there are some grey areas with senses that respond to internal signals, many of these are part of automatic systems and not very \u201cusefull\u201d for you. These are things like strech receptors for gagging reflexes, skin receptors that respond to bloodvessel dilation Then there is the indication that humans have some faint sense of magnetism (Magnetoception), but these experiments are few and not very conclusive. Time is another \u201csense\u201d that we have but there\u2019s not specific mechanism or receptors involved that is similar to the others. Humans are able to tell the passage of time which seems to get worse as we age.",

The sensory organs in the body will be useless without the function of MIND and CONSCIENCE which do the intellectual and emotional function of sensing. Nevertheless most people believe that we have five senses but the truth is different. How many senses do we have? Before answering this question, we should ask another question about the meaning of sensing. What is sensing? The word \u2018sense'- means, MEANING. The word \u2018meaning\u2019 means - knowledge/reasoning or logic that identify objects and subjects in order to utilise them as resources in creating life. Thus, sensing is the most important function of human life and existence. Sensing is an intellectual function of feeling or perceiving or experiencing something with the clarity and ability to understand, distinguish, differenciate one from the other to explain it to someone else. If we watch infants under three years, we can realize that their ability to sense and realize the environment is very limited. It has two limitations in sensing objects, information and subjects. One is the absence of language and the other is the absense of a mature intellectual and cognitive sense of being oneself. As the children grow beyond the age of seven, we can see a great change in the ability of children in one's ability to lean new things. That means a great change in the sensing ability of children. Now, we can answer the first question about the number of senses. Unlike people believe, we do not have 5 senses but only two(2). Mind is our primary sense that motivates or demotivates for action or inaction ...",

The song was actually inspired by nothing other that the Holocaust, the systematic extermination of Jews by Nazi Germany during WWII. Leonard Cohen, who was of Jewish ancestry himself, explained at an interview how something he once learned about the Holocaust moved him to write those lyrics. In his own words:\u2018Dance Me To The End Of Love\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019s curious how songs begin because the origin of the song, every song, has a kind of grain or seed that somebody hands you or the world hands you and that\u2019s why the process is so mysterious about writing a song. But that came from just hearing or reading or knowing that in the death camps, beside the crematoria, in certain of the death camps, a string quartet was pressed into performance while this horror was going on, those were the people whose fate was this horror also. And they would be playing classical music while their fellow prisoners were being killed and burnt. So, that music, \u2018Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin,\u2019 meaning the beauty there of being the consummation of life, the end of this existence and of the passionate element in that consummation. But, it is the same language that we use for surrender to the beloved, so that the song \u2014 it\u2019s not important that anybody knows the genesis of it, because if the language comes from that passionate resource, it will be able to embrace all passionate activity.Pictured above: Jewish inmates play music inside a concentration camp."

Which is why it\u2019s always advisable never to try provoking an ostrich.However, the myth does come from a true fact: when nesting, a female ostrich will dig shallow holes in the ground, so as to use them as nests for her eggs. In the process, she uses her beak to turn her eggs several times each day.In fact, from a distance, an ostrich leaning into a hole could easily look like it\u2019s burying its head in the sand! And that is what probably led to the common myth.But still, despite their comical appearance, ostriches are not cowards; they are dangerous birds that will never relent towards anything that threatens their lives or that of their young.

He arches his neck and hisses Now, let\u2019s say you\u2019re really really dumb. You don\u2019t back off.The rooster charges. You try and run, but the ostrich can run up to 40 MPH.Those four-inch nails aren\u2019t for show. In an instant, the rooster knocks you to the ground. A single swift kick tears through you, and you instantly bleed out. You see, the ostriches\u2019 kick is like none other.

A punch rivaling SaitamaMantis shrimp This clowny looking water-dwelling creature is no fucking joke. It has the fastest punch in the entire animal kingdom, with an acceleration of 10,400 g (102,000 m/s or 335,000 ft/s) and speeds of 23 m/s (83 km/h; 51 mph) from a standstill position. To put all this in perspective, the acceleration of that punch is equivalent to a 22 caliber bullet. Due to the punch being incredibly fast, there are vapor bubbles formed between the claws and whatever it decides to punch the hell out of. The collapse of these bubbles (known as Cavitation Bubbles) causes a shockwave with the force of 1500 Newtons. It basically is one shot, double effect with the punch and the ensuing shockwave which would most likely render its prey dead. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, during the collapse the bubbles tend to heat up to a temperature that\u2019s higher than the temperature on the sun\u2019s surface[2]. If that isn\u2019t kickass, I dunno what is. 3. Ultimate survival There are many creatures that can survive in extremely hostile conditions. But most of such species which can be classified as extremophiles are ones that are adapted to be able to survive in a specific niche set of hostile conditions like extreme heat or cold, acidic/alkaline, Ionizing radiation and so on. But, there is one such organism that checks the boxes across the board.Tardigrade Tardigrades or Water bears are creatures that push the limits on the ability to survive in harsh conditions to whole new level. To even go through the exhaustive list, it\u2019ll be too long, so I will briefly jot down it\u2019s most impressive abilities.They are known to survive and thrive in all regions of the world; from the hot springs or the top of Himalayas to the deep sea and under many layers of ice..Are thought to have been able to have survived mass extinction events that have taken place on Earth like the gamma-ray bursts or meteorite impact.They can withstand extremely cold temperatures down to 1 K (\u2212458 \u00b0F; \u2212272 \u00b0C) (close to absolute zero); & can withstand extremely hot temperatures up to 420 K (300 \u00b0F; 150 \u00b0C) for several minutesSurvive being subjected to pressure 6 times as that found in deepest ocean trenchesSurvive Ionizing radiation( waves that cause cancer) with 100 times the magnitude of what would be considered lethal to humans.Live without food or water for up to 30 years.Only animals to have survived exposure to outer spaceThe list could go on, but these facts are a testament to how tough this organism truly is.Footnotes[1] Basiliscus (genus) - Wikipedia[2] How The Food Industry Uses Cavitation, The Ocean's Most Powerful Punch",

The largest living birds, adult males may be 2.75 meters (about 9 feet) tall\u2014almost half of that height being in the neck\u2014and weigh more than 150 kilograms (330 pounds). The ostrich relies on its strong legs\u2014uniquely two-toed, with the main toe developed almost as a hoof\u2014to escape its enemies, chiefly humans and the larger carnivores. A frightened ostrich can achieve a speed of 72.5 kilometers (45 miles) per hour. If cornered, it can deliver dangerous kicks capable of killing lions and other large predators. Deaths from kicks and slashes are rare, with most attacks resulting from humans provoking the birds. One of the most interesting ostrich-attack stories involved the American musician Johnny Cash, who kept an exotic animal park with ostriches on his property. Cash encountered an aggressive male ostrich several times during his walks in the woods in 1981. On one occasion, Cash brandished a 6-foot stick and swung it at the bird, who dodged the swipe and slashed at Cash with its foot. Cash noted that the blow struck him in the stomach, and if it weren\u2019t for a strong belt buckle, he said that the ostrich\u2019s toe claw would have cut his abdomen open and killed him. 6 of the World's Most Dangerous BirdsIn summary, normally they can be more aggressive in the mating season and while protecting their eggs.",

If cornered, they can deliver dangerous kicks which are capable of killing lions and other large predators never mind humans. They have two toes and 4 inch claws on each foot. This helps the Ostrich to have traction while they run. Ostriches don't attack humans very often, but like most animals, they will attack if they feel threatened in some way. This is why it's best to observe ostriches from a distance.Their long, powerful legs can maintain a steady speed of over 30 miles per hour, with short bursts of up to 43 miles per hour. Their wings, while useless for flight, do help to keep their balance when they run.If Ostriches are raised on a farm from birth and looked after by their human keepers they can end up getting enamoured with them. Luckily human keepers do not enter their pen as Ostriches are can grow up to 9 feet tall and can weigh up to 320lbs along with their very sharp claws. They have the biggest eyes than any other bird, human or other land animal. Their eyes are bigger than their brains.Ostriches do not bury their heads in the sand. That is a myth. When nesting they dig a shallow hole in the ground to use as nests for their eggs. They are fastest two legged animals in the world.https://www.aboutwildanimals.com/2016/08/why-ostrich-attacks-are-dangerous.html The YouTube link below shows how fast they can run. As you can see these Ostriches don\u2019t give up easily.The male mating dance - The male attracts as many hens as possible by dancing, fluffing his feathers, flapping his wings and swinging his head around while getting down on his knees. Often the females play hard to get and just walk away but the male doesn't give up and continues until the females succumb to him. The male ostrich is normally silent but during breeding season but he finds his voice and makes loud, hollow-sounding booms to attract hens with strutting and dancing. The loudest voice, and the fanciest dancing technique is what makes him a successful breeder and also attracts more females to his harem.",

This collective misremembering is named after the South African leader Nelson Mandela, as many people falsely recall him dying in prison in the 1980s.

Now the Mandela effect is very specific in when he was meant to have died and it states 1988 or 1989 But did he? Remember my crosslinking above and you will see that a series of commonalities can mash into a false memory. Ok if not Nelson Mandela then who? And we do have an answer. Enter prime candidate : Steve Biko (1946\u20131977)But wait - you say that date is 11 to 12 years away from our perceived death time ! Wait for the bit that makes it all fit together. So for Steve Biko we haveAn anti-apartheid activistA socialistA man who guided a force of students into a freedom movementWas also seen to cause trouble for the White SA GovermentSpoke up against political prisonersEach and every one of these conditions can be associated also with Nelson Mandela. It is also a reason why the Mandela effect has him either assasinated or dying in prison. Steve Biko was assasinated. So why the connection? Because in 1987 a movie came out called CRY FREEDOM .. about the life and times of Steve Biko. A 1987 release movie would have been shown as prime-time in the following year on television .. or the next .. so most people would have watched a movie that documents a black activist (with at least 5 similar characteristic to Nelson Mandela) and his eventual downfall. So now we magically have our 1988\u20131989 death of Nelson Mandela (Steve Biko) But wait .. the crosslinking gets more interesting. This is Steve Biko played by Denzel Washington .. (notice the grey suit involved)This is how a painter draws the real Nelson MandelaHello Grey Suit ! And THIS is why they remember an assasination ! By the way .. an excellent performance by a young Denzel Washington. So as you can see .. sometimes it really isnt parallel worlds or infinite dimensions ..

There was no blood in the shower scene! Hitchcock has said that one reason he shot Psycho in black-and-white was because he thought the bloody murder might be too much for audiences. He used chocolate syrup as the blood swirling down the drain. Nevertheless, some audience members swore the scene was in color and that they saw red blood. In psychiatry, confabulation (verb: confabulate) is a disturbance of memory, defined as the production of fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, without the conscious intention to deceive. A delusion is a belief that is held with strong conviction despite evidence disproving it that is stronger than any evidence supporting it. It is distinct from an erroneous belief caused by incomplete information (misconception or misunderstanding), deficient memory (confabulation) or incorrect perception (illusion). The psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers proposed 3 criteria for delusional beliefs in 1913: certainty (the belief is held with absolute conviction), incorrigibility (the belief cannot be changed with any proof to the contrary) and impossibility or falsity (the belief cannot be true) (Jaspers, 1967). Delusions are associated with a variety of mental and neurological disorders, but are of diagnostic importance in the psychotic disorders. Delusional Disorder DSM-5 297.1 (F22) Now, I wonder about imagination? What about an artists\u2019 imagination? Marvelous confabulation My understanding of the misunderstanding of the human mind has left many marred by the educated who have no clue what imagination is. From my own cell phone, in a Nebraska sky:One sun or two? Confabulation or imagination? If I were to go to the educated ones and say: \u201cI saw two suns in the Nebraska sky\u201d, what label would be placed upon me, how would I be marred? Now I can say: \u201cI saw two suns in the Nebraska sky\u201d and \u201cI have proof!\u201d Then I would be labeled with a \u201cDefiant Personality Disorder\u201d or something much more grand. I say the Mandela Effect is imagination or a distorted memory. Imagine this, back in the 1980\u2019s we were not connected into the world web. How many times have you saw in your Facebook news feed, or on Twitter that someone famous had died? Only to find out it was a hoax. So if a rumor started back in the 80\u2019s Mandela died in prison, people would have no recourse other than to believe. I myself never heard Mandela died but then again, I did not know who Mandela was until 2009 so if I heard that, it would not have affected me or seared my memory.",

She also thought that Iraq attacked us on 9/11, and that was the reason her son was sent to Falluja. She did not have any understanding about the differences between Sunnis and Shiites. Incredibly, with the only specific being that when Vladimir Putin comes to the United States, the first State he sees is Alaska, this was evidence of her foreign policy knowledge. That has to be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. This was a woman that had never left the United States in her entire life until the nomination where she made one trip overseas. And it's ironic because she talked about the fact that having a maritime border with Russia and being bordered with Canada, gave her foreign policy knowledge and experience, but never yet crossed over into Canada or into Russia. I have been to well over 40 countries now and millions of Americans travel overseas every year. The idea that being in a foreign country, which she never even had, gave her any kind of foreign-policy experience on a political level, is flat out absurd. You would have far more knowledge about the world and it's conflicts by simply reading Foreign Affairs magazine and the New York Times every day. However since her state is close to Russia, the idea that gave her foreign policy experience, is so ridiculous I don't even know how to intelligently respond to it. I mean it's just as logical that because I live across the street from the hospital, I have gained great amounts of medical knowledge. And sometimes I forget that I live in New York State which borders Canada. So clearly I should have the requisite foreign policy knowledge to become President of the United States. And this is one of those rare impeachments of politicians knowledge that was actually backed up by basically the entire McCain campaign. There is a great movie by HBO that is now on Amazon and free on Amazon prime, called Game Change. It is a Hollywood movie, but extremely accurate as to the facts of what happened in the McCain campaign leading up to choosing her as VP and what followed afterwards, and is actually closer to a documentary. Steve Schmidt, who took over managing McCain\u2019s campaign midway through, has been very open about Palin's complete lack of basic knowledge. He was on many television shows after Game Change was released, and said it was so accurate, it could have been a documentary. Not only will you see a lot of what was public, regarding her lack of knowledge, but we see that she also suffered clearly from some kind of psychological problems. Serious ones. And there has yet to be one person in McCains campaign staff, who has said the movie is inaccurate, and those who worked closest with her on the campaign, said it is very accurate. John McCain also rightly deserves a lot of criticism. We all know in the United States that when a presidential candidate picks their VP, even though they publicly say this is the person they thought would best replace them if something happened to them, when everyone knows that they are picked because it would open up a certain voter base that they might not otherwise get. Either due to location of where the person lives, experience in certain areas, or a less or more extreme political position in the party they might have than the presidential candidate. In this case, they certainly decided they needed a woman as he's pulling among women was terrible at that point, and they basically looked on YouTube and watched several Republican senators and governors and when they saw her speak, they thought she was the best of the group. McCain had never even met Palin until the day she was picked, and that pick was a great and serious risk to the security of the United States, let alone the economy which was having its biggest crisis since the Great Depression. No one doubts McCain\u2019s great heroism in Vietnam, but in my mind this was such an atrocious and incredibly risky choice, I have lost all confidence in him. And he was someone who was generally liked on both sides of the aisle, although many people are not aware of a famous American scandal known as the Keeting Five, The five being the five Senators involved in the corruption. McCain was one of them and under normal circumstances, meaning that he was not a US Senator, he would have certainly been prosecuted, convicted and sent to prison (he also has a list of 14 countries which he wants us to invade militarily). Schmidt in the interview admits they did not pick her because they thought she was going to make the best president if the 70 year old (at the time), McCain died. He says and admits it was completely about winning and that a female governor from Alaska, who was good-looking, would be the best choice in the endeavor of winning. McCain interestingly brought up the idea several times of choosing democratic Senator Joe Lieberman as an option, which would've been a first in American politics for a ticket to have members of the two major parties on it (originally, there were no tickets. Everyone ran for president and who was there for second became the Vice President, which would often be of a different party and the person who became President). Thue film reminds us (although many of us can never forget) much of what was public back then, with these incredibly unbelievable answers to basic questions on domestic policy, economics, foreign policy, the Supreme Court, basic civics, U.S. History, and she could not even name a single newspaper or magazine which she read. She also could not name a single Supreme Court case she disagreed with. I mean if she didn't have a case in mind besides Roe v Wade which was already discussed, she should've just said any Supreme Court case, but obviously she couldn't think of any. The reaction of Schmidt and McCain\u2019s staff was incredulous. And some Supreme Court cases in United States history or so infamous for being representative of the time which was either very prejudiced, or when we had slavery, that everybody can name them. Dred Scott immediately comes to most people\u2019s minds, where they said basically that a Negro was property. There was the Koramatsu case where the court ruled that rounding up and imprisoning Americans of Japanese dissent during World War II, was legal. In fact the most famous Supreme Court cases have been embarrassing decisions and are well known. Marberry v Madison, which was in the early 1800s, gave the court the judicial review which is their main function now. They ruled that the Supreme Court has the right to decide which laws Congress passes are unconstitutional and illegal. And Fareed Zakharia, the brilliant mind on CNN, said, \u201cIt's not that she doesn't know the answers, she clearly doesn't even understand the questions.\u201d This was after another completely embarrassing interview she gave with Katie Couric. If you want to learn more about her list of embarrassments, watch that movie. I am an attorney and have worked for many politicians. Even the ones in the City Council or the state legislature, a stratosphere away from the Vice Presidency, knew so much more than this woman it was truly embarrassing. I know so much more than this woman. Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch came up to me after I spoke at a rally, which I often did when the assemblyman I was working for was up in Albany. I would speak on his behalf as a surrogate. Koch came up to me after I spoke one time and told me he thought I had everything it took to become an elected official. I remember greatly from the campaigns I had worked on, how horrible our campaign finance system was, and I did not want to be spending every week raising $10,000, which is what the average congressman has to raise to win reelection. The idea disgusted me, begging my friends and family for money every two years. I told him when they changed The campaign finance system, to publicly financed elections, I would love to run. In 1998 while I was working on a different congressional race, the one Anthony Weiner won, there was another congressman named Thomas Manton, who was going to resign that summer, midterm. There would be a special election, but no primary because there was not enough time. In cases like this, the party that runs that county, in this case the Queens Democratic Party, simply chose the nominee, which was the same as choosing the winter because the district was so heavily Democratic. And I thought a lot about it but realize after I won the election I would have to go back to fundraising. Very few people get an opportunity like that, but I just didn't think it was worth it. I Ibring this up because there are 435 members of the house and another hundred members of the Senate and I never thought that I could possibly have the intellect to be President or VP. However after seeing Sarah Palin, who was a VP candidate for a major party, I started to think that there's no reason I could not be President. And this year with Donald Trump. I don't doubt for a second that me and thousands of others would make tremendously better President\u2019s then he would. I mean some of the people we have elected president already, in recent years even, have been a complete joke. It was probably after we nominated and then elected George W. Bush twice, that I thought to myself I could easily perform the functions of President of the United States. And it's not that I'm saying how uniquely intelligent and knowledgeable I am. I am not. I think I am more experienced about politics than most people, but so are tens of thousands of others. My point isn't to elevate my standing, it's to point out how pathetic this woman and other people who have run and even won in recent years are. To me the reelection of George W. Bush was completely staggering. When we reelected Bush in 2004, The first convicted criminal by the way and an alcoholic, I told everyone I would leave the country if he won, and I would have if it were not for my father being ill and then me becoming very ill. But trust me, I would let rather live in any Western industrialized country than here. I despise this country. The ignorance is just hard to believe. And ironically it is naturalized citizens from other countries that know far more about our government and history then do people who were born here and took their citizenship for granted. 20% of Americans can't point to America on a map. Most of the Bush administration would be lucky to just be in jail and not executed for the crimes they committed. The biggest blunder in American foreign-policy history, the Iraqi war, killed 250,000 innocent people, the power vacuum left in Iraq lead to the formation of ISIS. The US government tortured countless people in direct violation of the Geneva Convention and our own domestic laws. The Patriot Act ripped up the Constitution with respect to the fourth amendment protection against unlawful searches and seizures. I mean Dick Cheney has openly confessed in his book and talked publicly about how we tortured many people. And this is where international law runs into so many problems, because it really can only be enforced militarily. It wasn't very difficult for Dutch agents to go into Yugoslavia and kidnap Slobidan Milosovic from Belgrade, and bring him to the ICC. I don't think they would be sending Dutch agents into the United States to do the same thing with Bush and other members of his administration. So it is very biased. Since the United States has the most powerful military in the history of the world, they might have a hard time accomplishing the abduction of Bush and others, not to mention the fact that the Netherlands is an ally of the United States and this could lead to war, a war between two NATO allies. I used to have such reverence for the office of the presidency, something that would be laughable that I could ever do that job. But since the beginning of the century with George W. Bush being in office for eight years, and the complete distraction of millions of lives he caused, and then someone like Donald Trump getting the nomination from a major party to become president, the office of the President of the United States is quickly losing its long revered status. Sorry, I got way off topic from your question. To answer your question exactly, I would have a very hard time imagining that she would have known there was an East and West Germany. I wouldn't even bet my life that she knew there was a country called Germany. Game Change, with Woody Harrelson, Ed Harris and Julianna Moore, would do an excellent job in answering many questions you may have, regarding Sarah Palin and the 2008 election. Or you can always look on YouTube for the interviews in 2008, which Palin gave one on one to get an idea of her incredible lack of intelligence. It will also give you great insight into her psychological makeup.",

My wife and I recently took a friend\u2019s recommendation to try out a new church and were shocked by how well the community there fit us personally. We joined up with one of the study groups there just after a series of weekly discussions that they continued in the group to reference through the Advent season, once in relation to this exact question. The series we missed was titled \u201cWhat You Don\u2019t Need to Believe in Order to be a Christian.\u201d The series was a different take on \u201cWhat Christians Beleive\u201d focused more on those things many people associate with Christianity, things that many Christians believe, things that in fact certain Christian sects feel you need to believe in order to be that kind of Christian, but that aren't really things that are core to what makes a Christian a Christian. The Immaculate Conception is one of those things. Many (I\u2019d say probably most, but I don\u2019t have numbers to back that up) Christians believe in the Immaculate Conception - the idea that Jesus was conceived by Mary when she was still a virgin. The idea of the Virgin birth comes from 3 main places in the Bible, the primary comes from the gospel of Luke, Chapter 1, Verse 26\u201338:In the sixth month of Elizabeth\u2019s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, 27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin\u2019s name was Mary. 28 The angel went to her and said, \u201cGreetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.\u201d 29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. 30 But the angel said to her, \u201cDo not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. 31 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, 33 and he will reign over Jacob\u2019s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.\u201d 34 \u201cHow will this be,\u201d Mary asked the angel, \u201csince I am a virgin?\u201d 35 The angel answered, \u201cThe Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[b] the Son of God. 36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. 37 For no word from God will ever fail.\u201d 38 \u201cI am the Lord\u2019s servant,\u201d Mary answered. \u201cMay your word to me be fulfilled.\u201d Then the angel left her.The Gospel of Mattew is the only other Gospel to begin before the birth of Christ, and in Chapter 1, it references the fulfillment of prophecy when Joesph is thinking about divorcing the pregnant Mary in chapter 1, vs 18\u201325:18: Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit.19: Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly.20: But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.21: She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.\"22: All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet:23: \"Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,\" which means, \"God is with us.\"24: When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife,25: but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son, and he named him Jesus.The prophecy the angel is talking about in verse 22 is from the book of Isaiah, Chapter 7, vs 14:Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. \u201cBehold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel.\u201dSo why is this on the list of \u201cThings you don\u2019t have to believe in order to be a Christian?\u201d A few reasons. First and foremost, when you ask the question \u201cWhat is a Christian?\u201d The generally accepted answer by Christians is \u201cA person who believes in God and accepts Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior.\u201d Note the period at the end of that sentence, because it\u2019s supposed to belong there. Second, while Isaiah 8:14 is usually translated from the Hebrew as \u201cvirgin\u201d which can be the correct translation of the word \u201calmah,\u201d the actual literal translation is simply \u201cyoung woman.\u201d The implied meaning of \u201cvirgin\u201d is an assumption based on the fact that a young unmarried Hebrew woman was assumed to be a virgin.Is \u201cvirgin\u201d or \u201cyoung woman\u201d the correct translation of Isaiah 7:14?Is \u201cvirgin\u201d or \u201cyoung woman\u201d the correct translation of Isaiah 7:14? Is Isaiah 7:14 even intended to be a Messianic prophecy?https://www.gotquestions.org/virgin-or-young-woman.htmlSo from the get-go, the prophecy referenced by the angel in Matthew chapter 1 doesn\u2019t really say \u201ca young unmarried woman who has never had sex,\u201d It says \u201ca young woman.\u201d Then when you read and re-read Luke, the conversation with the angel says that Mary was a virgin at the time of the conversation, and it says that \u201cThe Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you\u201d as the answer to how that will happen, but it doesn\u2019t ever really address anything after that, you can interpret that as \u201cwell, so that means conceived of the Holy Spirt, and there you have it,\u201d or you can see it a number of ways including \u201cI\u2019m inspired by the Holy Spirit, It\u2019s OK for me to conceive this child because I\u2019m being told that\u2019s what\u2019s supposed to happen.\u201d It\u2019s not that a typical Christian doesn\u2019t, or that it\u2019s wrong for a Christian to believe that Mary was a virgin when Jesus was conceived. It\u2019s just that you don\u2019t have to believe that in order to \u201cbelieve in God and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.\u201d In fact, sometimes, restrictive beliefs that have other explanations, and just don\u2019t make sense often get in the way of the kind of faith needed to simply \u201cbelieve in God and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.\u201d It\u2019s even worse when you\u2019re talking about things that are generally accepted \u201cChristian\u201d beliefs which at best result from mistranslated Greek or Hebrew or at worst simply don\u2019t have an actual biblical basis at all. Another note - When you look at this through the lens of Catholic Doctrine, it takes on another meaning, since (Been a while since I studied my Catechism) according to Catholic doctrine as Nick Theodorakis reminded me, the Catholic meaning of \u201cImmaculate Conception\u201d is not related to the conception of Jesus, but the conception of Mary herself, it refers to the belief that Mary was born without original sin. Answering this question to that definition, Most Catholics (who yes, do consider themselves Christians) believe that, and are supposed to believe it, but most Protestants do not. It\u2019s one of those things I learned in Catholic School that had no Biblical basis but was taught as an article of faith. Jesus said what was important in Mark 12: 28\u201331.One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, \u201cOf all the commandments, which is the most important?\u201d 29 \u201cThe most important one,\u201d answered Jesus, \u201cis this: \u2018Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.\u2019 31 The second is this: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no commandment greater than these.\u201dHe did not go on to say \u201cOh, and you have to believe my mom was a virgin (or free from original sin) when she conceived me, or forget the rest of it.\u201d",

            "Scripture defines Jesus as God Incarnate. This we may all agree, depending on what denomination we belong to, but most mainline Christians can agree on this. And so we can all agree that Romans 3.23 does not apply to Jesus because He is God and perfect, though He took on sin to save us, He did not participate in it and so defeated sin that we might all become washed and grow into perfection like our heavenly Father.

Well in that segment of time Romans 3.23 does not apply to Adam and Eve. What about Enoch? He Walked with God and was not for God took him. Was he sinless. I am not sure, but I am sure that God applied the Redemption of Jesus to raise Enoch to heaven and so Enoch was able to overcome the effects of sin before Jesus birth. This is all that the Catholic Church is saying and the Orthodox, that\u2019s over half of mainline Christians (its not a democracy), who witness to the Immaculate Conception. It was only understood in terms of the Grace, the Power and the Love of Jesus the Incarnate Son of God and Son of Mary. Mary did not experience the effects of sin of the fall of Adam and Eve, just like Enoch, by a preview of the Grace of Jesus Redemptive act on the Cross and at the Resurrection. She is not contradicting Scripture then (taking Adam and Eve, Enoch, Jesus Incarnation found in Scripture all into account). Mary is a sign of contradiction, she is a sign that Jesus reversed the fall by causing her to be a New Eve, perfectly created from conception so that Jesus may be born in a spotless vessel. Thus the Immaculate Conception occurs by Jesus and for Jesus, it adds to the Gospel the truth that Jesus overcame all sins, including original sin. If you want to agree with me as a Catholic in the above words, just take out everything I just said about Mary and the Immaculate Conception\u2026. but wait, now Jesus is reduced for the sake of argument. The Immaculate Conception is not an optional truth, now that I have come to know it as truth I must believe it, but I want to out of love and devotion.",

Mary was saved from sin by the power of God, the grace of God manifest in the shed blood, the resurrection and ascension of her son, Jesus, still some years in the future. If this is not at least plausible, one has to question the destiny of the Old Testament saints- are they in hell? are they saved? if so, saved through Jesus who is centuries in the future? or is there some other salvation? I find the most plausible of these ideas is that my sense of \u201ctime\u201d is not as all-pervasive as I might think. And that God can work around that. And yes, she rejoiced in God her Savior.",

The old cotton quilt was getting wet moment after moment; within few minutes it wouldn't be of any use and the family would have to struggle all night. Everybody woke up; the situation appeared a mess; they started cursing their fate for that sudden downpour. Finally, the father got up, took an old piece of the asbestos sheet he brought from somewhere, and a few bricks and climbed up the roof after making some efforts in the downpour. He got completely wet but managed to cover the leaking roof with the sheet, and plastic and put bricks over it. As he got down, shivering in the cold, everyone inside was happy and cheerful. There wasn't any leak now; they could sleep all night peacefully. Finally, the father changed his clothes, wiped his body and all of them slept peacefully for the night.Success is not about the accumulation of wealth or power; neither is success about results; success is how well you cope with the present moment and fight out your circumstances. \u2018Success is the will power to act.\u2019 Thanks for the question Rana Arjunsingh Gour.",

            "This is not an easy question to answer, because there are several recent conflicting estimates of the size of the Milky Way.[1] Recent studies put the size of the Milky Way at 1 trillion solar masses, roughly the same size as the Andromeda Galaxy.[2] Andromeda has been estimated to have 1 trillion stars while earlier estimates of the Milky Way have put the number of stars at 200 - 400 billion. Estimating the number of planets brings us back to winging it again. The Wikipedia article puts the number at 100 billion. That seems to be an absurdly low number.

Estimating the number of planets brings us back to winging it again. The Wikipedia article puts the number at 100 billion. That seems to be an absurdly low number. An article in Universe Today [3] said that we have 8 planets in the solar system so that is a reasonable number to go with. Most of the stars in the Galaxy are considerably smaller than the sun so I would go with a smaller number, say 4, giving 3 or 4 trillion planets. Then there are rogue planets, planets roaming the galaxy without a parent star. The early formation of a solar system is a very chaotic time with planets migrating into the sun and others being ejected by near collisions. Rogue planets also include objects that never became massive enough to begin hydrogen fusion to become stars. There have been estimates as low as as 1 and as high as 100,000 per star. My low estimates says that there are as many rogue planets as there are stars. My estimate is 4 trillion planets in the Milky Way. My credentials are that I shared a house with 3 astronomy PhD. students when I first moved to California. Edit: Quora doesnt think my credential are impressive enough. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to live with three astrophysicists? You get credentials by osmosis. I do however try to leave footnotes, so that the interested can see where I am coming from. If real astronomers find problems I will try to fix them. I dont want to appear stupid for all the internet. However, in matters of politics, I dont need no stinking footnotes.Footnotes[1] Milky Way - Wikipedia[2] Andromeda Galaxy - Wikipedia[3] How Many Planets are There in the Galaxy? - Universe Today",
            "It's not possible to count all that. There are billions of planets which orbit stars and rogue planets( Planets which don't orbit any star, and instead the Galaxy). Our very own Hubble space telescope has found hundreds of planets already, but we're still missing the whole picture. Besides, there are many chances that planets in outer space can contain life.",
            "As of today 3313 extrasolar planets have been discovered, all rather nearby. Based on this density there must be billions of planets given how abundant they are. There is a free app: Exoplanet - it will plot masses and distances from the planet\u2019s star.",
            "How many planets have we discovered in our Milky Way Galaxy so far? Good question. Before I answer just a warning. Not every users on Quora knows what they are talking about and some are just deceitful. Check credentials and downvotes. Look for consensus. Obviously , that also applies to me but I try to only answer question that I\u2019m sure I know the correct answer or know there is no answer. So officially around 4000 but the figure is about 6000 with the extra 2000 waiting confirmation. Expect that number to rise rapidly as new instruments come online."
