            "The Character, \u201cWinnie the Pooh\u201d was created by author A. A, Milne as part of his story collections. Winnie the Pooh was written to be an anthropomorphic representation of the stuffed toys in the bedroom of Milne\u2019s son, Christopher Robin Milne. In all of Milne\u2019s stories and poems, Winnie The Pooh, or as he is sometimes referred to, \u201cEdward Bear\u201d was always represented as male.",
            "Trick question! Winnie the Pooh is male but was named after a Canadian bear (which lived at a zoo that the author and his son like to visit) named Winnie who was female, thus some controversy, especially with pants off, no apparent genitalia\u2026. The author, and his son, the owner of the original toy bear on whom the story was based, are both quite adamant as to his gender. We don\u2019t know if he identifies as male, as I don\u2019t know of anywhere in the books that he refers to himself by gender, only that he is male by birth:)",
            "The author uses the male pronoun. Many people will regard this as definitive, since transgender was unmentionable at the time it was written. For those who disagree, you will have to be informed by your reasons for that disagreement.",
            "It is a common internet meme to compare Chinese President Xi Jinping to the cartoon character Winnie the Pooh. This started after a photo of Xi walking with then-US President Barack Obama was compared to a picture of Winnie the Pooh walking with Tigger. However, it's important to note that such comparisons can be seen as disrespectful in some contexts, and it's always best to approach political figures with respect.",

Perhaps it\u2019s that Winnie the Pooh is largely featureless in human terms, and the faces of others are easily projected onto him?

My doctors are not entirely sure how tapentadol fairs compared to other opioids or why my case is the ideal response to opioids. It is hit or miss and unfortunately for many people, it\u2019s a miss.

There is some very positive research with tapentadol and I do think it will become more popular to prescribe. For example, tramadol is pharmacologically similar, but for many people (including myself), we can get a bad reaction from tramadol but not tapentadol. Until suitable drugs can be assessed from blood work, it\u2019s trial and error. Of course, speak to your doctor about stopping tapentadol to see if it\u2019s safe with your dosage etc. In my case, it is, and I do speak to my doctor (a pain specialist) about it.",

But I found even using a few weeks and abruptly stopping caused rebound and withdrawal. It depends on your dose. As it is a C-II substance atypical opioid and NRI, it can cause tolerance, dependency, and withdrawal if used for any extended period of time even at the dose prescribed by your doctor (or no doctor).

Physiological dependency is when a person is seen to face itchiness, chest pain, or vomiting if the medication is not taken. Also, psychological dependency states to a person to be cranky or irritated to small things if the medication is not taken.
