(I can attest to the fact I did laser on my back and wound up with more hair than when I started with, because lots more got \"activated\" -- hence the reason I wound up doing electrolysis which works and doesn't do that.) However, having said all that, plucking a grey hair here or there hasn't really seemed to matter a whole lot. I have a grey hair I see in one spot I pull and it comes back, but it's always just the one."

First, the \"usual suspects\" that you will also find in most good travel guides:Learn how to use chopsticks properly in advanceNever point chopsticks at anything or anyoneNever move bowls/etc with your chopsticksNever stick your chopsticks vertically into food. Ever.Never pass food to someone from-chopstick-to-chopstick. Ever.In restaurants/etc., check for (and put on) provided toilet slippers before entering a washroom, even if it is tinyMake sure to take those off again when leaving itDo not tip. Tipping is very uncommon.Slurping is fine for ramen, soba and green tea. For pretty much the entire rest: don't.Take off your shoes before entering a private home, or any sort of traditional place like a classic japanese restaurant, onsen or ryoukan. \u200b... but in fact, the places where this is required are rather hard to miss.   Now on to some slightly finer points:One side of escalators is for standing, the other should be kept free for passing through. (Which-is-which depends a bit on the region you visit) Watch the locals and do as they do.Never blow your nose while in direct Japanese company, especially while eating. It is considered gross and unrefined. Sniffle instead. Yes, you read right. Sniffling is considered posh. If you really must, visit the washroom to blow that nose.Always wait at the entrance of a restaurant for a waitress to show up and guide you to a table. This is the standard. Only pick a table yourself if you are quite sure that the place doesn't even have waiters to begin with.If you have to pick a restaurant table and want to appear modest, generally pick one closer to the door.The same goes for seating at a table. The guy farthest from the door is usually the most important one, and vice versa.Maybe not very relevant since you probably won't get many calls there, but still: switch your phone to silent (a.k.a. \"manner mode\" in Japan) when entering any train or otherwise quiet place.When riding the subway as a man, watch out for (and make sure to avoid) dedicated women cars. Usually the women-only thing is limited to certain times of the day, but you are well-advised to try to observe it during all other times, as well.Always maintain a well-controlled and gentle speech volume, no matter what happens. Outbursts of any kind (amazement, happiness, anger, etc) are seen as either childish or, when coming from foreigners, scary. Japanese have some odd reservations towards foreigners. Always make a conscious effort to dress well and act in a decidedly non-threatening manner. To use an image: act as if you are a tiger among sheep - who really, really wants to prove that he's a vegetarian.Use wasabi and other condiments offered to you sparsely. Especially soy sauce. It used to be silly expensive in the old days, and being skimpy with it is still considered a sign of good manners even today. If you are done eating and there's a leftover puddle of soy sauce on your plate, however small... then you used too much.When entering smaller eateries that have counters, make sure to watch out for \"ticket vending machines\" near the entrance. Buy a ticket for the desired meal, then hand it in at the counter. If you want to appear well-versed, consider making eye contact with the cook behind the counter (he will almost certainly be looking at you) and announce what you want even before handing in the ticket. Also, in such small eateries, you are often expected to return your tray to the counter after eating.Maybe, maybe tip in rare cases... but only if you clearly caused the staff/taxi driver/whomever some extraordinary amount of trouble. Still, do not do so if the other person offered to do that stuff from their side. I.e. only do it if it's clearly something you imposed on them unaskedly - and even then, do so moderately.The hot towels provided with meals are to cleanse your hands, and can even be used for wiping your forearms to get a pleasant fresh feeling. But if you can somehow bear it, do not use them to wipe your face or throat, even if you are sweaty.It's a slight thing, but generally try to keep your feet away from people. The customs for this are way less strict in Japan than in some other asian countries, but the feet are still considered the least noble parts of your body.If you visit an onsen, scrub yourself down very thoroughly in the washing area before entering the hot water. Yes, even the space between your toes - and even if you showered just half an hour earlier. In fact, feel free to make quite a show of it by using a lot of soap to produce silly amounts of foam in the process. Trust me, it will deinitely be to your social benefit.On a similar note - shower each day, everyday. And don't be mislead by those heavily-scented soaps offered in hotels and elsewhere. The Japanese are actually not very fond of fragrances - in fact these soaps are basically meant to be used instead of deodorant/perfume. Sweat is considered natural and healthy, but you are supposed to always wash it off, not cover the smell. Simply put, it's fine to sweat a lot - but if you smell, you socially failed. (Considering that you are probably not used to the sweltering climate, especially in summer, I strongly recommend cheating by also bringing non-scented or weakly-scented deodorant products.)When visiting any shinto shrine that has a water basin near the entrance, wash your hands and mouth before entering. The sequence is left hand-right hand-mouth (as seen in this video). For extra points, re-purify the ladle at the end, too, by dripping water along the handle (like this).Also, when making an offering, any small amount of money works, even if it's just 10 yen. However, ideally you should prefer using 5yen coins for doing so. They are traditionally considered to bring good luck because of the way \"go-en\" sounds.Finally (and really obscure): when walking on the temple/shrine grounds towards the main building, do not use the middle of the path. It can be considered as bragging. Ah well. There is so much more, but the post is already long enough as it is... Hm, maybe one final section to close things off. If your Japanese is good enough to get the pronounciation right: here is a bit of purely optional voicework for you. (Note that several of these phrases are basic-Japanese-101, and are actually used in a lot of places - but then again, maybe some of the situations I mention here may be a bit surprising for the uninitiated). Quietly say \"itadakimasu\" before eating, even when not in company. And if you are in company, maybe extend the ma-syllable a bit into itadakimaaaaasu so that others can \"join in\" for saying this phrase.If you enter/leave an elevator with people in it, say \"Shitsurei-shimasu\".If you want to make a compliment to an eatery, clearly say \"Gochisousama deshita\" to the empty air when exiting through the door.If you enter a shop and no personnel is in sight (actually rare), say \"Gomen kudasai\" with clear and friendly voice to get serviced.If you enter a private house or any other sort of non-public space, say \"Ojama-shimasu\". Bonus points if you say it a second time when being asked to enter an even more \"inner\" space, like a private room.If you are in a private house and get offered tea or cookies (and trust me, you will get offered some): say \"Okamainaku\". It's akin to saying \"oh, no need to put in so much effort for me\" - and it won't stop anyone from doing so, but it will definitely be well-received.If you want to really make a Japanese person happy, try calling them \"-sensei\". Even if it's just done once and in a half-joking manner. Mind, this term is traditionally reserved for teachers, writers, doctors and martial arts specialists, but if you see an opportunity to justify doing so (maybe that persons just taught you some new words?)... do it. I'm always very grateful if people help me improve my Japanese, and the effect of this one little word is quite amazing.If you say goodbye to someone, do so with style. Mata / Ja mata / Mata ne (we'll meet again) is mostly for same-age friends or coworkers. When adressing service personnel that you might meet again soon, a simple friendly \"de wa\" or a silent nod is usually enough. But if you want to be more polite and/or don't really expect to meet that person again, you may as well pick an \"O-genki de\" (be healthy/fare well). Finally, concerning the popular-culture-famous Sayonara (also a version of \"farewell\")... well... mind, it is usable, but if you want to be culturally savvy, it's not that nice a thing to say. Mainly because it carries a certain undertone of \"we part forever here\".",

For best results, pronounce the \"i\" and the \"u\" in an unvoiced whisper, and don't accent any of the syllables.A second, extremely handy phrase is \"O-negai shimasu.\"  It means, \"Please do so.\" Or more simply \"Please.\"  You can add it to #6 for a full, formal first meeting.You'll notice that Japanese gesture much less than Westerners, and they spend much less time in actual eye contact.  Match them and everything will go more smoothly.Prolonged eye contact with strangers can be a provocation.  There is much you'll want to observe carefully, but work on that side vision.For that matter, tourists everywhere spend a lot if time looking up (toward the sky) with their mouths open.

Walking obviously faster (or slower) than everyone else is not recommended.A translation app for android or iPhone is the fastest way to ask for directions or get information.

            "I really want to emphasize the speech volume point. As someone born in America, Japan is an exceptionally quiet country, even in a city. If you see everyone else being quiet, follow suit. If they're being a bit more rowdy, say in a bar, then it's ok to be a little louder. Just think about the situation around you. In general, though you are a foreigner, just try to blend in when it comes to how you conduct yourself and not be any more obtrusive than you already will be simply by being there.",

Nothing substitutes for eyeball-to-eyeball negotiations with Chinese companies, big or small.  Do not merely rely on Alibaba, GlobalSources or similar b2b platforms for \"trust ratings.\"  The little stars and badges you see on Alibaba (like \"Gold Supplier\")\u2014those can be bought, and most companies buy them.  Some Chinese entities are known to just \"park\" a name without being a real company, just to gain the \"residency\" (no. of years where a company has been on Alibaba), and then put up goods when they have something to sell.  A lot of the top search results on Alibaba, just like on Google, are paid results, but are not explicitly indicated to be so. This is especially important for those sourcing equipment that costs a lot of money.  Many Chinese companies will look very presentable on their websites, but turn out to be nothing more than trading outfits in China.  They'll have an office, but the actual manufacturing will be subcontracted to yet another company, usually in the same city.  On the flip side, just because their company websites contain typos and out of date information, doesn't automatically mean they're frauds.  Often, it is just a problem of communication skills, and the ones tasked to maintain the website have poor English skills.  Another possible reason could be that their business model doesn't rely much on having an online presence, like for example, rare earth metal producers, or mineral ore refining companies (both crucial to electronic gadgets). I cannot quantitatively substantiate this claim, but based on personal experience doing business with Chinese companies, I'd have to say most companies on Alibaba are nothing more than middlemen outfits.  Why do I say this? A recent search for leather footballs revealed 54, 700+ suppliers in mainland China alone (using the country filter on Alibaba).  There are only around 1.91 million manufacturing entities in China (legit factories, not those hole-in-the-wall sweatshops).  If we are to believe the 54,700 figure, that means fully 2.86% of China's factory output is devoted to manufacturing footballs.  That, of course, is inconsistent with the number of footballs sold worldwide.  The only logical conclusion to draw is that many of these companies are just resellers of other companies' products.  The fact that, upon inquiry, their prices tend to track each other's quite closely is tentative proof that they're sourcing from the same suppliers.  This experience is fairly uniform across all industries. Pay attention to the office or manufacturing facilities themselves:  If, upon visiting, they feel like fly-by-night outfits, leave.  Just leave.  The unbelievably low offer price will not be worth the troubles you're going to have to deal with later.  Pay attention also to the company names.  You might encounter a different name posted in the office wall, and yet another one posted in the factory.  This by itself does not mean you're being taken for a ride.  For example, most people know the iPhone assembler's name to be Foxconn Tech Group, but that's just the trading name (for stock exchanges).  The mother company's name is actually Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (\u9d3b\u6d77\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5de5\u696d\u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8).  When in doubt, ask them up front.  It'd help if you hired someone just to check up on the basics (company registration, years in business, etc).   Related to the above, do not rely solely on trade fairs like the Guangzhou Trade Fair or Nanning Expo for business leads.  Most companies displaying there are legit, yes.  But there are also constant incidents where the booth is actually manned by another company while the booth header says something entirely.  A Beijing agricultural products company, for example, operating under a booth that clearly says \"Shanghai Cosmetics and Pharmaceuticals Co.\"  Do not assume fraud immediately.  This happened probably because the cosmetics company, for some reason, didn't want to participate in that trade fair, and just subleased its allotted space to the agricultural products company seeking exposure.  Although the trade organizers have cracked down on this, it still happens.  Do not stop at gathering business cards and gawking at the brilliant displays.  Make the effort to visit the company premises itself.  Ask for references, especially previous customers outside China.  Interview staff casually, like during a business lunch or dinner.    Those settings tend to loosen up workplace formalities like overly courteous language, or at the trade fair itself, where staff have their best foot forward.  Make a mental note of salient points, and any factual discrepancies observed.  Investigate further on any questionable findings. Make at least 3 trips to China: One for sourcing and negotiating (prices, quality, terms of contract, etc).  Another for checking things are in order mid-process (this is the one important step that many successful Kickstarter projects missed, leading to slipshod quality and bad press later on).  Last one is for making sure the goods are finished on time, and ready to ship as per agreed specifications.  This last step is redundant, but will save you a lot of time, money and headaches if the supplier you chose, despite careful vetting, turns out to have cut corners to make more profits.  Contracts mean nothing to a bad supplier; they're just a formality to get purchase orders in. The extra expense of going to China just to check pre-shipped goods is a heck of a lot cheaper than having to deal with product recalls and apologies to customers.  If it means a slight delay in delivery, so be it.  Rather that than deal with angry customers later. If you can't bring yourself to risk signing up with a bad China supplier even after doing your homework, you might consider engaging the services of supply chain companies like Li & Fung. What they do is basically work with you regarding your product specs, quantity, price, and shipping/logistics arrangements.  They're very efficient and straightforward to deal with. Although you will naturally have to give up some profit margin, you will get more assured of quality, as they're a publicly listed Hong Kong company that is more than 100 years old now.  Wal-Mart USA used to source most of its products through Li & Fung, but they've decided to do it themselves.  But that's only because Wal-Mart has gained a lot of in-house experience operating their stores in China.  When you find a keeper, stick with them: As previous commenters have noted, relationships or guanxi (\u5173\u7cfb) is very important.  The personal bonds formed through business are just as important as the term sheets you signed.  This is why a physical presence is necessary prior to starting a business engagement.  As that Northwest Airlines ad once said \"You cannot fax a handshake, you cannot fax that look in the eye.\"  There will be times in the business relationship that Chinese suppliers will encounter troubles, like sudden shortage of raw materials leading to unexpected price increases.  If you have a good relationship with them, they will make this clear to you.  It'd be either they absorb the short-term loss to keep the relationship going.  Or you might have to tear up the purchase agreement and adjust the prices upwards.  Or you might agree to split the losses between the two of you.  But if they know you're in it for the long haul, Chinese suppliers (the reliable ones) will find a way to repay you for this flexibility.  Any of the above would be much better than a supplier who quietly goes about sourcing faulty raw materials, hoping you wouldn't notice, just to keep from losing money.   For example, there are actually a couple of glass manufacturers that could actually undercut Biel Crystal Manufactory Co., Ltd. (HK-listed, but manufacturing in Huizhou, China) in price, but both Apple and Samsung have stuck with Biel all these years for their iPhones, iPads and Samsung Galaxy gadgets.  Proving that price is not everything.  Consistency, reliability, quality and ease of transaction also factor greatly into the supplier-customer equation. No supplier will bleed money for you forever.  If it's a mutually beneficial relationship, that will be a sustainable path to profits for both of you. Mind your culture (when meeting): Do not neglect this aspect.  It helps for a good first 30 seconds of making a good impression. \u2022 Use both hands when giving or receiving business cards.  When handing over your card, make sure it's readable from the receiver's point of view (facing outwards from you).  Make the effort to study the card you receive, especially if it has an English version (usually on the flip side), and repeat the acknowledgment you made earlier upon first meeting \u2022 Do not point at people with fingers or hands.  You may gesticulate, but not directly, as in accusing someone.  It's considered very rude.   \u2022 Refusing alcoholic drinks or food served to you is considered impolite.  If you're squeamish about certain types of food, like squid or snails, say so before the dishes are ordered.  If you don't drink, say so beforehand. \u2022 Do not stick your chopsticks into the rice or any food vertically, as when pausing while eating.  This looks like incense sticks offered to the deceased, and will get you looks of disapproval. Do not also gesture or point with chopsticks in hand.  You wouldn't like it either if someone pointed all around with his fork or knife while eating, would you? \u2022 When the bill arrives, you might make a move for your wallet.  While Chinese hosts will acknowledge that going Dutch is common practice elsewhere, they will never allow you to foot the bill, especially since it's a business meal.  Insisting on paying will make them lose face, as it connotes them not being gracious hosts.  A sincere \"thank you for the nice meal\" will suffice \u2022 Avoid raising uncomfortable topics, such as Taiwanese independence, Tibet and Chinese human right issues.  Mainland Chinese are ever-conscious of both government disapproval of and outsiders' sentiments towards these topics, and would rather not discuss them, even outside the workplace.  In my experience, academics are more open to discussing these things, but never business people. \u2022 The concept of \"saving face\" means simply not directly embarrassing the other party with confrontational attitudes, however right you feel.  But since this is a business discussion, everything has to be laid out clearly.  It's not impossible to be frank and polite at the same time. Turn the maybes and the probablys into undoubtedlys and firmlys before you sign that contract.  If the contract is in Chinese and you do not understand the language, ask for a period of time for it to be translated (by someone you hire) before signing it.  And still, after the commitments, trust but verify later on. There are other faux pas listed here: What are some cultural faux pas in China?, but I personally disagree with the part about not finishing your food.  In my experience, if you did that, people would think you didn't like what they ordered, and hence didn't finish eating your meal. ",

That's how the Chinese work Impossible for American Companies that work on Brand Loyalty and Brand Building to compete in such a market As long as their quality is the best , Chinese will buy American products over Chinese products Yet the minute Chinese products come up of the same, similar or better quality at lower prices due to the lack of or minimal BRAND PREMIUM, the Chinese will flock to such products and not buy the American products or Japanese or German productsTake gaming consoles In 2007, Nintendo, PlayStation and XBox dominated 94% of the market in China Yet by 2013, China swamped the market with generic knock offs like Fuze and Souiju Boy but instead of 800 -2400 RMB the prices were 399 RMB - 800 RMB each Today these knockoffs have led to established quality console brands like AnbernicBrands that can compete and which have better games than Nintendo yet at 999 RMB instead of 1399 RMB that Nintendo costs Result is today Local brands have a 46% market share and foreign brands share plummeted from 94% to 54% in a mere 16 yearsYou sell a product in China The Chinese will create a range of generic knock offs at a fourth of the price Slowly the better knock offs will develop quality Within a few years, the Chinese establish a supply chain and dominate the market with a host of comparable quality products at a lower price The American product won't have any more demandAnother reason is Chinese entities understand their market demand better than American entities You can't sell in the Chinese market like you can sell in the US market It's why Didi destroyed UberThe fact is unlike India which relies on Nationalism and Protectionism China relies on sheer competition Any one can sell their products in China but you can be rest assured no product can remain unique for more than a few years The Chinese will replicate the product and create low price knock offs which won't have more than 20% market on the beginning Yet the competition for knock offs are shark like with roughly 4500 Knock off Consoles in the market between 2007\u20132016 aping the Xbox and PlayStation and Nintendo Then China develops quality products and establishes a supply chain and creates a better product at 65% the price The US product has to say goodbye This is especially true of Electronics & Clothing & Retail Accessories Only Starbucks, McDonalds, Microsoft and BMW have enhanced their market share in the last decade in China without much competition from local entities",

The way to say \u201cno thank you\u201d is \u201ckeko desu.\u201d4. If someone gives you a gift, even something as small as a piece of candy or a pen, it means they want to be friends. If you want to be friends, give them a gift back. If the gift has a red ribbon on it, it means that it is a happy occasion.5. If you buy a new pair of shoes and plan on wearing them outside, don\u2019t put them on inside and walk outside. Inside shoes are inside shoes, and outside shoes are outside shoes, and never the twain shall meet.6. If you are a guy, Japanese guys don\u2019t open doors for girls, but the Japanese girls traditionally open doors for guys. However, those Japanese girls are thrilled if a guy opens her door or carries her heavy bag because the Japanese guys don\u2019t take care of girls like that.7. If you are a foreign guy, be careful around the Japanese girls. The Japanese guys don\u2019t make moves on them, and they may be completely shocked if you try to hold their hand or kiss them. A soldier in Okinawa didn\u2019t understand and got himself up on rape charges when he thought he was just making moves on a woman.8. Never don\u2019t put your futon away! Always fold it up in the morning because if you don\u2019t, mushrooms can grow under the futon. Once a week, take that futon and hang it out on the balcony in the sun and fresh air. It will take good care of your futon and make your land lord very happy.9. Learn to bow. Learn to be humble. Never put yourself first, and they will like you because of it.10. If someone explains something to you, don\u2019t just sit there and be quiet. Take part. Don\u2019t interrupt, but say things like, \u201cOh, is that so?\u201d or \u201cao desuka?\u201d or \u201cHai!, so desu, ne?\u201d which means, \u201cyes, that is how it is, isn\u2019t it.\u201d11.

If you have to sneeze, or wipe your nose or sweat from your forehead it will be secretly appreciated.My first and second trip I didn\u2019t bring one. When I was on the train, if I sneezed or coughed or was sweaty I would get subtle looks. My third time around I purchased some very fashionable microfiber handkerchiefs from Amazon. They were like $7 for 6 of them. I got this little feeling that people were satisfied with my handkerchief action. I felt like the subtle looks were closer to a nod of respect, than a frown of disdain. 2. Don\u2019t open or close taxi doors. The driver will do this for you from the specially made control in the car. If you do so you will get a tiny rebuff, and maybe a dirty look. It\u2019ll happen once or twice, but then you\u2019ll get use to it. 3. Be proactive in gift giving. When a Japanese person travels somewhere, they are kind of expected to bring a gift back with them for others. Kit Kat candy bars are sometimes used for this as they are regional in Japan. (Made by Nestle instead of yucky Hershey) Bring some cool, little gifts from your hometown and give them out generously to taxi cab drivers, or anyone who goes out of there way to help you. My cousin brought a bunch of baseball hats from her local bar in Pennsylvania, The Knotty Pine. We would give them to cab drivers and our AirBnB hosts. Most were incredibly grateful, or at least acted like they are. One taxi cab lady driver wouldn\u2019t stop bowing she was so thankful. 4. Don\u2019t tip. If you come from a country that tips, it may seem like a natural thing to do, but that tip represents judgement. As the Yen at first will seem a little bit like paper money, you may not know how much an appropriate tip may be, thus insulting the server or cab driver or concierge. I would actually imagine that if you tipped someone a lot of money they would refuse it, or not understanding what has happened, would give it back to you. Hope this helps!",

Their malls and restaurants are much quieter- in Australia I have to almost scream to have a conversation in a busy restaurant but not in Japan. It made eating out a pleasure.2. Do not use mobile phones to talk in trains, buses or restaurants Japanese cities are densely populated there is a need to avoid inconveniencing others. This thinking is ingrained in their culture.3. Do not eat or drink when you are walking about or if you are not in an eating place. There are no public dustbins so that is a hint. We made a mistake and we bought takeaway in a departmental store basement and ate outside. That was a no no. There are designated but limited seating inside but will be hard to find a seat in peak hours. The only place where this was an exception is Chinatown in Kobe.4. Do not take photographs of people without first asking for permission Japanese values privacy just like others do. We made a mistake of not asking before taking pictures when food was served to us in a hotel restaurant. We thought it would be fine being a public place.I can sensed the discomfort but I did not know until later visits.5. Do not cross your legs when seated in trains as your shoes will be pointed out potentially poking people who are standing. Trains very often are jam packed with passengers standing just in front of seats. I only learned this recently. D not seat on the floor of trains. I saw a young group of tourists entered and immediately sat on the floor and started chatting as if it was their home country. I felt bad but Japanese are very forgiving they know they are tourists.6. Always dress smartly preferably all items matching particularly women. I observed on trains how immaculately dressed everyone was and I wondered how they managed it -must have taken a lot of effort. I always wear a suit jacket everywhere I go and I think they appreciate it. My wife does the same and the reason why we did this was to ensure we can gain access to most places. It is always better to be overdressed than under was the rule I followed when I travelled on business.7. Do not run or rush to try to catch public transport it is frown upon because it creates chaos. Japanese public is an orderly place and despite Tokyo with 37M population we do not feel the crowds except on train stations. They have built extensive underground places so most people walked underground.There is no need to rush because trains run typically every few minutes.8. Queue up and on train or subway platforms there are designated lines. Everyone waits for their turns and patiently no matter how long the queue is. I was once in a hurry I think must be a security check at an airp5ort. I placed my bag on the conveyor belt a little too soon so the attendee took my bag off. I did it again after some wait and he did the same. I did it 3 times before it was accepted and each time he did not show any anger. So there is a rule for everything they cannot be bent.9. 9.When ordering meals order exactly what is on the menu. Do not ask for a bowl of noodles to be shared. My friend and his family wanted to do sharing and they were made to leave that was in Hokkaido. I have seen another family told to do the same and that was in Okinawa. Efficiently is everything in Japan and anything that disrupts smooth operations will be stopped and from the above examples in all places.10. Do not wear shoes inside homes or temples. And you need to leave your shoes at the entrance with the shoes pointing outwards towards the door. Inside the home you need to put on separate pair of shoes for the toilet [ http://toilet.it/ ] (links to: http://toilet.it [ http://toilet.it/ ]). It is the same for umbrellas.11.

Porridge/cooked grains of various kinds (typically served with butter and/or jam):1 - Millet. (Ooh, my favorite!)2 - Four- (seven-, eight-) grain porridge. (This one is takeaway, which shows how typical it is.)3 - Buckwheat. Most people eat it with milk, although I know some who dump ketchup in there, heathens.4 - Oatmeal.5 - Kama drink. Kama is a mixed flour made from roasted barley, pea, oat, and rye. The drink is made by adding kama and some sugar to kefir/buttermilk. Yummy and healthy!6 - Semolina, called \u2018manna\u2019 in Estonian and Russian. Didn\u2019t come out as gorgeously liquid as it should have, so it isn\u2019t very presentable in this photo.7 - Chicory drink, rather popular in the ex-USSR; serves as a replacement of coffee, particularly in schools and kindergartens, as \u201cchildren\u2019s coffee\u201d.8 - Cereal or muesli with yogurt, kefir, or milk.9 - This sludge looks like chai latte (what chai masala is known as in Estonia).10 - Cereal again.11 - Sandwiches on whole-grain bread. Some people here eat white bread, I prefer whole-grain. Cheese and sausage/ham are popular sandwich toppings.12 - Cocoa.13 - Sandwiches with crab sticks (surimi) and sprats. (Sprats are all the rage here, in various dressings and marinades.) Best suited on top of black bread.14 - This sludge is more resembling of green or white tea with milk.15 - Boiled eggs.16 - Moar sandwiches with sausage; this one with peppers. Yum! And, as we all know, Alice always puts butter under every topping.17 - Tea without milk. (White/green/herbal? Who knows!)18 - Sandwiches with cheese and cheese spread/processed cheese.19 - That day, I made pancakes. I also got to know that chess and pancakes do not mix together; you\u2019re undoubtedly going to lose either one or both. In Estonia, pancakes are usually eaten with: sour cream, jam, condensed milk, honey, ice cream, grated cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, cheese-and-ham, etc. I prefer either sour cream+jam mix or, again, butter.20 - Coffee with milk/cream.21 - Omelette.22 - Eggs and bacon, of course. I prefer American-style bacon, it\u2019s thinner and saltier. We also have British bacon and local cuts.23 - little things to-go, such as cottage cheese cream/curd (typically with raisins or cocoa).24 - curd snacks, these with lemon and chocolate icing/cranberry filling. Hugely popular in Estonia, especially with kids. My friends who have emigrated to other countries always stock up on curd snacks when they visit Estonia.25 - Yogurts and yogurt-based desserts.26 - Cottage cheese cream/cream cheese with jelly/starch drink (you have no idea how I struggle with a dictionary right now, but really these things have no direct equivalent in common Western terminology). \u2026. And, of course, some people\u2019s breakfast looks something like this:Then there\u2019s tons of various pastries, leftovers from yesterday, triangle sandwiches from local snack bars and gas stations, i.e. whatever people can be assumed to eat for breakfast elsewhere when they are too busy to cook. But these above are typical for most Estonians as a combination of local traditional products + remnants of Soviet traditions + influence of Western food trends. Whew, I should probably submit this somewhere as an answer for Quora I put the most time, money, and effort in making, heh. Thanks for reading!",

Subsequently, the food habit of the people here are very much dependent on grains and herbs. Here I would talk about some foods commonly and usually eaten at breakfast in Bangladesh.Bhaat (Rice) \u2014Basically, in villages of Bangladesh, people eat rice for breakfast. The Bangladeshi especially the villagers love rice a lot. They truly relish it. Give them anything but rice for breakfast, you cannot make them happy. Hot steamed white or brown rice to be served with freshly cooked vegetables, or \u201cdal\u201d (lentil), or curry are purely majestic. Red chillies might be stir-fried to be put on the plate to add to the taste! The carbohydrate intake in the morning also helps keep them boosted for long hours and provides energy for heavyweight rural works.Ruti (Flat Bread) \u2014Ruti is an unleavened flat bread puffed over an open flame or tawa. this is very common both in villages and urban households. Being a popular wheat-made bread, this is considered as a healthy breakfast item. People enjoy this with the same items as taken with rice.Pauruti/Bread \u2014Bread is the most usual breakfast in the metropolitan areas including Dhaka, our capital city. We, normally, love to eat eggs with breads. Bread prepared here look like as follows \u2014Parata (Paratha) \u2014Paratas are magnificently mouth-watering. These are special types of bread made from wheat flour and fried in the chula (open flame) until golden-brown. It\u2019s almost the same as Rutis but you add a little oil to the khamir to make it crispy yet soft inside. This is a Mughlai cuisine, and the delicacy is served with different curries, fries, sweetmeats, egg-fries, and etc. Unlike the Indian cuisine culture, we barely eat paratas with filling or stuffing inside.Bakarkhani \u2014Bakarkhani, a long-lived Mughlai tradition, is a bread-like snack and widely popular in Old Dhaka. Plain bakarkhanis of old Dhaka areas look like the picture given below.Dim Bhaji (Omelet) \u2014One of our favourite food for breakfast is omelet or dim (egg) bhaji. Though boiled or scrambled or poached eggs are popular, but I bet the most popular form of an egg to a hungry Bangladeshi is the spicy omelet. One has to crack the egg and mix it with some chopped onions, chillies, and tomatoes if desired, and then needs to add a pinch of salt and a little bit of water/milk to the mixture to make the omelet fluffy inside. Now, this mixture should be poured on the warm oil in a hot pan on the chula, and fried in medium flame till golden brown and cooked well inside. Then, it is served with rice/ruti/parata/bread.Shobji/ Niramish (Mixed Vegetable Curry) \u2014Shobji is widely popular for breakfast here. We cannot deny the taste factor and health-benefits of a well-cooked vegetable curry. Cut the different assorted vegetables in cubes, add different spices and chillies to it, and cook them in medium flame without much use of water - make it all mouthwatering. It is served with ruti, parata, nan-ruti, luchi, even with rice.Pitha \u2014Pitha, a special type of pie made of flour, is a speciality in Bangladeshi cuisine. Pitha is an essential breakfast item during winter here. These delectable pithas are mostly sweet, though some are spicy.Cha (Tea) \u2014Cha (tea) especially milk-tea is a common drink taken at breakfast times in Bangladesh. It is almost a must at every household in Bangladesh, and very complementary with the main courses. If you are invited as a guest to any of our houses for breakfast, even you will find yourself served foods following a warm fuming cup of delicious tea.Some other Foods \u2014Bangladeshis also eat Luchi, Khichuri, Naan-Ruti, etc, though these are not eaten much regularly for breakfast here.Love to see these anyway? You will love more once you taste these, be sure!(Images from Google)",

We love to eat this with some very savoury chillie paste known as katta sambol.Also if we travel some where and we are taking our own food, my mom wraps rice and curry in a banana leaf (need to cut the leaf as it is very big and you just keep it on hearth or on stove to make the leaf more flexible) Here goes rice and curry in banana leaf! It's much tastier and you get a nice aroma when you open the parcel and its very tempting. But these things are unfortunately limited to rural areas. But my mom grows few bushes of banana trees at my place.And also sometimes we eat in lotus leaf! Its really nice when you put your rice and curry or whatever you eat in that. These are only in rural areas. because there's no lakes in cities to get lotus leaves. Some shops in cities are specially serving their food on these leaves, as people love them.Oh Godness how did I miss my personal favourite heavenly dish! Its called milk rice. We eat milk rice with some chillie chutney and some bananas. Usually it's the food made for any auspicious occasion or any special occasion. Milk rice is a must for any traditional occasion.Here you can see the traditional oil lamp which lightens up before any occasion starts.And these are the main food you have for breakfast and Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans have a savoury teeth than any other people I know.",
            "I think it's important to start with me saying that I hate the 'unhealthy' vs 'healthy' debate when it comes to food.

Good vs Bad is a natural human bias, but it tends to create a bit of a toxic food environment. It hurts our relationship with food and increases confusion about nutrition, rather than enhancing it. Healthy or unhealthy, is entirely context, and dosage-dependent. As I'll detail in my answer, some cruciferous vegetables, by and large, are very healthy for the majority of people. However, they can become unhealthy in people with selenium or iodine deficiency and other thyroid-related disorders. Likewise, even something we all generally demonize, 'sugar,' can be very useful in the context of recovery from intense physical activity. It can also increase performance in long-duration endurance performance as well. For most people, a diet high in sugar certainly isn't a very good idea, but it can have its place for particular objectives. Juice, is easily over consumed, but in small manageable doses could also have a place in your diet, and many have been shown to have positive health effects too. Yogurt, in its plain form, is also generally considered healthy. However, take a look at the grocery store selection and you'll see that the majority of people opt for sugar-laden alternatives (generally you'll see as high as a 20:1 selection of sweetened versions to plain versions). How you treat your food is important and marketing is generally in place to make you eat more than an ideal quantity of food overall. Provided you can manage ideal dosages, most foods are not 100% bad for you (the only real exception I can think of, off the top of my head is hydrogenated trans-fatty acids found in many processed vegetable fats -- and even then, some ingestion won't kill you), nor 100% good for you. If you tried to eat every single item of food ever quoted in a study, as having positive health benefits, in quantities that have been shown to have those benefits, every single day, you'd no doubt be well beyond your needed energy intake, despite the high quality of your food. You can't do it all, eat EVERYTHING that's 'healthy' and avoid EVERYTHING that is 'unhealthy.' This will still most likely lead to weight gain and the detrimental health effects that are generally associated with obesity (like diabetes, CVD, etc...). This is despite having what most people could, or might consider a 'healthy' diet. Overall quantity still matters even for research 'proven' healthful foods. You can still overeat foods that many of us associated with 'health,' it's just less likely because they are generally harder to overconsume. Whether they are full of more fibre, and protein, have high water content, or are more satiating in general, we have a harder time eating too much of them in their less altered states. Furthermore, we can't demonize all forms of processing, or alterations to food either. Many forms of processing unlock nutrients and make them more bioavailable to us. i.e. in many cases, cooking/processing 'unlocks' nutrients so that they can more easily be digested and absorbed. For example, various protein powders can be very useful in many contexts, though quite processed by many people's standards. It's namely added refined oils/fats, in combination with simple sugars and excessive salts, in place of other more valuable micro and macronutrients (like protein and fibre), that tend to be the most problematic for most people.With that in mind, here are some advertised foods that you can have a chuckle about to yourself:Fat-Free (typically = loaded with simple sugars instead)\"All-Natural\" or \"Made from Natural Ingredients\" (as if natural prevented Lead or Mercury from being very toxic)\"Organic\" and yet, still processed into a box or packaged (not ALWAYS but very often)Comes in a box or package and has a very long shelf life thanks to preservatives and heavy processing (think many 'crackers' or 'chips' though not necessarily 'all' of them, and not necessarily that bad in appropriate quantity)Juice (especially types that have sugar added and are not 100% juice, these often get counted as a serving of 'fruit' or 'vegetables,' in my opinion - mistakenly)Most breakfast cereals (throw a bunch of heavily processed grains and ingredients together, market it as 'healthy' like Special K, ya right....)Yogurt (if we're talking plain, high protein versions, OK maybe, but most people opt for types with a ton of added sugar - see 'Fat-Free' above too)Dried Fruit (in small quantities sure, but I've known a lot of clients who go to town on these and they are very energy-dense, particularly in sugars, making them easy to overeat - a small cupped hand is generally 1 serving)Some RAW Vegetables (particularly many cruciferous vegetables and soy that have goitrogenic properties - i.e. A high quantity of these particularly raw in your diet like supposedly 'miracle health foods' kale, collards, broccoli, etc... can alter thyroid function over time if over consumed - Keep in mind that these are still very healthful in appropriate dosages for the majority of people, that overconsumption is probably more than a few servings per day (so you'd have to eat A LOT of them) for healthy people and that cooking negates a significant amount of this effect overall. You are more at risk if you are deficient in iodine or selenium, so for most people, this is generally not a major concern.)Many commercially produced 'Vegan,' 'Vegetarian' and 'Paleo' foods. (Listen...processed is processed, regardless of whether or not the ingredients fit loosely into a 'dieting strategy' - that vegan-soy-like-burger product, is not really any better off than the commercially produced hamburger)A lot of other 'marketing speak' foods, that use jargon into fooling you not to read the ingredient list or research how it was manufactured/made and from what sources.Anything touted as a 'Miracle Health Food' or 'Superfood' because it encourages greater overall consumption, under the notion that 'more-is-better.' There is always the potential for the overconsumption of any food, even for highly perceived healthful foods like dark leafy green vegetables or healthful seeds like flax or chia. Dosage is an important consideration, you can overconsume nearly anything, so remember that variety is a reasonably important consideration in any diet.Most of these are really public perceptions. 'Healthy' eating is really quite different to a variety of people based on their own belief patterns and perceptions. It's not really black and white. I eat eggs almost every day for breakfast. But my parents still view eggs as cholesterol bombs that will negatively impact your cholesterol (despite evidence in the last decade to the contrary) and thus health. My cholesterol is in a completely normal range. Likewise, I drink full-fat grass-fed milk semi-regularly, eat red meat usually once or twice a week, and cook with coconut oil/milk, butter and ghee in reasonable quantities (saturated fat is about 1/3 of my total fat intake generally). This is sacrilegious to many people who grew up in a time when saturated fats were heavily demonized. If I were worried a lot about their consumption, it would probably lead to negative health effects. AKA The Nocebo Effect. Dosage and context always matter a great deal when discussing healthy or unhealthy foods too. To the hypertensive, limiting salt is probably a good idea. To the healthy person, if you cook most of your own food, cooking with salt is probably not a big deal (and makes stuff a little tastier...). A few small daily doses/servings of raw cruciferous vegetables is probably fine for the majority of people who don't have any issues with their thyroid, iodine or selenium deficiency. However, six servings a day over a year or more could eventually lead to a poor outcome too. At the end of the day, it's really more important to keep in mind context. Is eating Vegan or Vegetarian or Paleo a healthy eating strategy? Generally, yep! However, you can still fall into any of those nutritional camps and not have a great diet overall if you're not meeting your nutritional requirements or are getting foods from poor sources overall. Potato chips and french fries are still Vegan. Though if you eat them once a month, probably not going to significantly alter your triglycerides readings either. Furthermore, while I generally encourage people to eat more whole minimally processed foods, the keyword that some people seem to miss is 'minimally.' Bread (think something like Ezekiel bread) can still have a healthy place in your diet, and by all accounts is fairly processed overall (ground flour, salt, water, yeast, mixed together and baked). It's the extremely processed stuff that I think most people should generally avoid (though having some from time to time, is probably not a HUGE deal breaker either). Here might be another example of where context is also important, gluten-full bread is very unhealthy for the celiac but mostly fine for everyone else. Other examples of food of this nature may include:Cheese (especially Raw, and/or minimally processed varieties) - could be potentially healthful (dairy consumption is positively correlated to maintaining a healthy weight)Yogurt/Kefir (provided it is plain) (again, dairy, but also some fermented products improve gastrointestinal healthy in some people too)Many fermented foods like Sauerkraut, Kimchi, Kombucha, etc... (though overconsumption can also cause some stomach issues and there is a risk with raw fermentation going 'off')100% Juice or Juice you make yourself (easy to over-consume because it's a liquid, but certainly a glass a few times a week for most people won't break the bank if they so chose)Dried fruit (provided they are consumed in appropriate quantity - i.e. sparingly and perhaps the preservative-free types are generally better - if you look at dried cranberries, you'll often see added sugar and sunflower oil...what?)Hamburgers you've made yourself with minimal ingredients from high-quality sources in particular (I make burgers all the time, but avoid the caloric bombs by using leaner chuck and skipping the buns and heavy sauces)Many homemade/minimally processed soups (which are 'processed' look on the labels of some canned soups)Many raw vegetables are great for you, while simply cooking others negates 1/3 of any goitrogenic effects (I'm not personally a fan of all raw diets, but to each their own I suppose, cooking can often make many great vitamins and nutrients more bioavailable).Many protein powders (extremely processed when you think about it, I look for ones with ingredients like 3-4 ingredients whey, vanilla, cocoa and stevia only, but very useful for people who are very physically active)To imply that all processed food is bad for you is misleading. It's also bound to lead to a lot of psychological anxiety/stress for the modern human being. Eat manageable quantities and there is most likely no appreciable health detriment of certain foods, but nearly everything and anything can be over-consumed if you put a lot of effort forth. It's just generally harder to over-consume whole minimally processed foods in general because they require a lot more from us digestively speaking. They leave us feeling full for longer and are more difficult to break down/process. Most public health organizations allot 10% of diet overall to allow some processed foods like sugar as a tolerable limit; It's better to think of food as existing on a spectrum rather than 'healthy' and 'unhealthy' (or 'good' and 'bad'). I'd argue that you can probably include some cheesecake, pizza or other publicly perceived 'bad foods' here or there in moderation with great success. More and more it appears that being too restrictive with your diet may create some negative psychological experiences. Remember that other things like high stress/anxiety, lack of regular movement, or lack of sleep, can have an equally profound effect on 'health' and are major contributors to things like heart disease. At some point you have to ask yourself:Is it really worth it to always try to have the 'perfect' healthy diet all the time?I'd argue no...in fact, people who do, are far more likely to binge eat, yo-yo diet, use short-term dieting solutions and suffer from psychological eating problems like cognitive dietary restraint. That is a vicious cycle that is incredibly difficult to overcome.",

            "Companies have done a super job of converting healthy food into unhealthy product by mixing unhealthy ingredients to it for taste and texture. Here is my take on unhealthy food being advertised as healthy one 1. Masala Oats Masala oats are advertised in India as one of the most healthy breakfast option. But if you will look at Masala oats ingredient other than plain oats you will find the truth about it. Various taglines are used to promote it such as \u201cBreakupwithJunk\u201d or \u201cTastewithNutrition\u201d Why it is unhealthy?

Here is my take on unhealthy food being advertised as healthy one 1. Masala Oats Masala oats are advertised in India as one of the most healthy breakfast option. But if you will look at Masala oats ingredient other than plain oats you will find the truth about it. Various taglines are used to promote it such as \u201cBreakupwithJunk\u201d or \u201cTastewithNutrition\u201d Why it is unhealthy? It contains Maltodextrin (artificial sweetener), flavor enhancer and it contains added colour. It is also high in salt (Sodium content is not disclosed in their packaging) Solution - Make khichdi at home using plain oats instead of white rice. It will taste more or less similar to Masala oats. 2. Peanut Butter There is no doubt that peanuts are healthy but the way peanut butter is made commercially makes it unhealthy. Why it is unhealthy? It contains hydrogenated oil which is nothing but a trans-fat (bad for heart). You can assume that \u201ctrans-free\u201d peanut butter still contains a small amount of trans fat if partially hydrogenated oil is listed as an ingredient. Solution - Make peanut butter at home by grinding it using very little olive oil and add some honey for flavor 3. Himalayan Pink Salt This salt has been advertised as unprocessed and unrefined raw salt with good amount of minerals. It is also very costly i.e. 10 times more costly than regular salt. But the real question is if it is really worth its price. Why it is unhealthy? If used in moderation then this salt is healthy otherwise it also has very high sodium content just like the other salt. Solution - Limit the sodium intake by replacing salt with lime juice or fresh herbs4. Diet Coke Diet soda seems like a health-conscious choice. It saves you the 140-plus calories you'd find in a sugary soft drink. But there's more to this chemical cocktail than meets the eye. Why it is unhealthy? First of all it contains artificial sugar, then soda is also not good for bone health. Also, many studies have found that diet coke even though is low in calorie but can increase the weight and even cause diabetes. Solution - Stay away from soda and drink chilled water when thirsty5. Fruit Juice Fruits are extremely healthy and have been consumed since ages but the fruit juices sold in the market are not the healthy one. Why it is unhealthy? Most of the fruit juices contains excessive amount of sugar in it which makes it super unhealthy. Also, when you extract juice of any fruit it loses its fiber content. Eating whole fruit is always the best healthy option. Solution - Eat whole fruit instead of juice 6. Atta Maggi/ Oats Maggi After Maggi has been criticized for containing maida in it, all the bigger brands came up with idea of replacing maida with whole Wheat (Atta) or oats. So, even though it has atta or oats, you might be wondering why it is still unhealthy. Let me enlighten you\u2026. Why it is unhealthy? Just to increase the taste and look of maggi, it is infused with flavor enhancers and natural colour. Also, it has high amount of sodium in it which is not good for BP, weight management and heart. Solution - There is no other option than to avoid eating maggi 7. Brown Bread Everybody likes eating bread for breakfast and now a day there is a trend of eating brown bread considering it to be healthy. Let\u2019s find out what makes even brown bread unhealthy. Why it is unhealthy? Most of the brown bread sold in the market consists of maida only and it has been colored to give a brown colour. But the Britannia has come up with a good range of brown and multigrain bread which is actually made up of whole grains and not maida. But still guys nothing can beat homemade chapatis. Solution - Buy brown bread from good brands only and don\u2019t forgot to check the ingredient label8. Marie Biscuits There is a kind of Marie revolution in India. I could see Marie biscuit at everybody\u2019s home. The reason they are consuming it is assuming it to be healthy. Let\u2019s find out its truth. Why it is unhealthy? There are 150 calories in just 6 biscuits serving of Britannia Marie Gold Biscuits with 22% fat and 70% carbs. It is also loaded with sugar (7gm in just 6 biscuits). It also do not have any fiber in it since it is mostly made up of Maida. Solution - Avoid eating biscuit as they are always high in sugar9. Yogurt Yogurts are advertised as being good for weight loss management and for good digestion. Why it is unhealthy? Most of the yogurts available in the market are loaded with sugar and artificial flavors thus making it high calorie and unhealthy. Solution - Always buy the plain yogurt which do not have any flavor and sugar added to it10. Milky Bar Chocolate I have seen many people considering milky bar as healthy chocolate i.e. being high in calcium and protein. Why it is unhealthy? First of all it is very sweet i.e. loaded with sugar and consist of saturated fat which is not good for heart. Instead, for your protein and calcium source one could just drink milk. Solution - Eat dates if you want something sweet and drink milk if you want calcium11. Peanut Chikki Again peanuts are healthy but the way peanut chikki bar is made makes it unhealthy. Why it is unhealthy? Most of the peanut chikki bar used refined sugar instead of jaggery or honey thus making it very unhealthy. Solution - Eat peanuts with jaggery instead of buying the sugar coated chikki from the market",

            "Despite the claims from many overzealous fans claiming that all Koreans listen to Kpop, there is a significant majority of us Koreans who could care less about the music genre, or even outright despise it. It\u2019s important to keep in mind: Kpop is just another form of pop culture; it\u2019s a type of culture that you should not be forced to like or even respect just because your nationality or ethnicity is affiliated to it.

It\u2019s important to keep in mind: Kpop is just another form of pop culture; it\u2019s a type of culture that you should not be forced to like or even respect just because your nationality or ethnicity is affiliated to it. It\u2019s like saying \u201call Japanese people watch anime\u201d, which is false. Majority of the Japanese people I met could care less about anime, or even despise it. For me, as a Korean, I don\u2019t listen to Kpop, simply because I am not big into the general pop music genre, and I feel there are many other ways that people can learn and appreciate the Korean culture, aside from getting into something like Kpop. And really, this is what I find very annoying about the fans. They attempt to play the nationalistic card to \u201cforce\u201d me (and probably even other Koreans who don\u2019t listen to the music) to enjoy Kpop. Like seriously, just because I don\u2019t like Kpop, doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t like my native Korean culture. For those Koreans who do love Kpop, they are not forced to enjoy it just because they\u2019re Korean. They listen to it, simply because it just appeals to them. Likewise for those Koreans who don\u2019t listen to it, it\u2019s just not their thing, not because they hate their own native Korean culture. Kpop as I mentioned, is just another form of pop culture. That\u2019s how we Koreans would view Kpop as. It\u2019s just a culture that is not different from anime in Japan or American football in the United States. If it is something that doesn\u2019t suit our taste or interest, we should not be accused for being a \u201cnational traitor\u201d, or even worse, \u201cracist\u201d, for not getting to it.",
            "Pretty much the same way Americans see pop culture - some casually like it, some can't care less, a few outright loathe it, while some are obsessed. I'd fall under the second category, but I know people who obsessively follow pop idols and go to every concert they can afford. Most people I know generally aren't that invested - a lot of us just know the songs, maybe know the faces and names of a few singers, but that's about it. By the way, I fall under the South Korean millenial group, so I can't speak for the older generations.",
            "Based on what I read, most Korean people don\u2019t actually care much about K pop. Idols are hardly taken seriously. Korean GP have more respect and admiration for actors and solo artists. The average Korean person is more likely to listen to Korean ballad than K pop music.",

Stray Kids are my haven in the sense of finding good EDM and I love their 'malatang' sound. I don't want it to change, it's their style and color.. . . \u2726; The Minsung (Lee Know X Han) VS 2min (Lee Know X Seungmin) fight is one of the most annoying kpop ship battles ever.Minsung shippers will hate on Seungmin, feel uncomfortable to find him around or dislike seeing him with Lee Know just because of a ship. 2min shippers will hate on Han, feel uncomfortable to find him around or dislike seeing him with Lee Know just because of a ship. It's getting to a stupid point now. Stop it, shippers.. . . \u2726; Hyunlix (the ship) is mostly only popular because they are the most biased members. . . . \u2726; \"Stray Kids songs all sound the same, Stray Kids formula bla bla bla...\" Yes, thanks for reminding me that in every Stray Kids songs there's a 3racha member involved in production.Is the same people producing the songs, how do you expect them from not having an artist own vibe, color and style. They found their genre, stop complaining and focus on your faves.. . . \u2726; I love Silent Cry but it's like something is missing in the song. . . . \u2726; Gone Away > Red Lights > Surfin'. . . . \u2726; I love that they add a meaning to almost everything.When Hyunjin and Bang Chan had the idea of making a song with a sexy concept (Red Lights), Hyunjin was fast to clarify that he did not only want a sexy song but a song with a deeper meaning.. . .. . . \u2726; I will forever feel sorry for the stays that Stray Kids hurted and disappointed with their ignorant actions and they seem to think the same.If past could be changed.... . . \u2726; The fact that they aren't good at apologizing doesn't mean they aren't sorry.I mean, apologizing is a choice of words so even a good apology can be a big lie and a bad apology says anything. Acts are what really matter.. . . \u2726; Their songs age pretty well.I have been listening to them for over a year and I'm still not tired. This haven't happened to me with any other group.. . . \u2726; Stop shouting how \"their lyrics aren't that good\" when you don't even understand korean to realize their word plays (I don't know korean either, but this korean guy explains songs lyrics so \ud83e\udd2d) . . . \u2726; Their ballads aren't fillers.You just don't like them.. . . \u2726; What they did in Voices is pretty genius.And with that I mean the part in the bridge when Han raps, then Changbin and then the two at the same time, representing the voices in their heads talking. Then Bang Chan's \"There's so many voices\". Chef kiss.. . . \u2726; Hellevator is one of the best pre-debut song . . . \u2726; They have one of the best discographies in kpop. Yes, they have skips but not many. . . . \u2726; Thunderous is not God's Menu 2.0 and they don't sound alike.Yes, they have the same arrangement, but then compare the instrumentals. How can someone say that they sound the same \u00bf\u00bf??\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36 . . .. . . \u2312\u2312 \u2727 \u2312 \u2312\u2312 \u2727 -\u02cf\u02cb Bang Chan opinions \u02ce\u02ca- . . . \u2726; You can tell he is pure. . . . \u2726; Bang Chan seems to go with everything the fandom says even if it's not true.Like, if stays say that Red Lights is a bdsm song, he will go with it even if it's not true (Red Lights lyrics and MV don't talk about that).. . . \u2726; Following the above, he really does a lot for stays in terms of fanservice and I start to feel bad for him.\"Stays like me without a shirt on? Then I will take it out\". \"Stays like me showing my body? Then I will do it\". This boy really does everything in his hand to make his fans happy. He wants to feel loved and accepted by stays and does whatever he can do, even if it's awkward for him.. . . \u2726; His vocals > his rapping. . . . \u2726; I'm still questioning WHY his name is mentioned for everything.I have seen people say \"Bang Chan is not using Felix voice well\" and \"Bang Chan is not using Lee Know falsetto well\" like... What? He is not the only member that produces, but why is the fault always falling on him? You all are obsessed with him at this point, not only in the good sense but in the bad too.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36 . . .. . . \u2312\u2312 \u2727 \u2312 \u2312\u2312 \u2727 -\u02cf\u02cb Lee Know opinions \u02ce\u02ca- . . . \u2726; Lee Know savageness can sometimes be too much but it seems like these days he realizes about it quickly and turns it off.Like when he used Seungmin's shoulder to jump higher but then patted him and made sure that he was ok, I'm glad he realizes if he is too much.. . . \u2726; He learns really fast. He only trained for months but he wasn't even that bad at singing and rapping. . . . \u2726; Lee Know choice of words are the funniest and that makes his lives more entertaining. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36 . . .. . . \u2312\u2312 \u2727 \u2312 \u2312\u2312 \u2727 -\u02cf\u02cb Changbin opinions \u02ce\u02ca- . . . \u2726; Changbin singing voice sounds like a voice a professional singer would have.I can't explain it, if you get me, you get me.. . . \u2726; People will be like \"He only shouts and raps fast but that doesn't equal of him being a good rapper\" but the reality is that they only listened to him rap in one of these videos of him vs someone of their faves and they felt attacked \ud83e\udd27Like, it's not his fault that he is a good rapper and you think he is a threat to your bias. You only listened to four songs. Close your mouth.. . . \u2726; He is so friendly and fun, seeing him interacting with more idols in Kingdom proves that. . . . \u2726; His bridge part in The View is hair stand on end making. . . . \u2726; There's something really unique in his rap in Any.I haven't heard it a lot in kpop.\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36 . . .. . . \u2312\u2312 \u2727 \u2312 \u2312\u2312 \u2727 -\u02cf\u02cb Hyunjin opinions \u02ce\u02ca- . . . \u2726; His rapping delivery is truly charismatic.And also his delivery in general.. . . \u2726; Stop saying that he wasn't kicked out for his beauty when the reality is that his case was different and handled better than yours. . . . \u2726; Hyunjin singing in Red Lights is THE BEST. . . . \u2726; No one would have ever called him untalented if he wasn't the visual.Is the moment you are the visual the moment you are seen as unworthy.. . . \u2726; His dancebreak in The View and center part in Scars>>> . . . \u2726; He is a better rapper than some main rappers in other groups. \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36 . . .. . . \u2312\u2312 \u2727 \u2312 \u2312\u2312 \u2727 -\u02cf\u02cb Han opinions \u02ce\u02ca- . . . \u2726; Even if you don't find him the most handsome, his visuals are the cutest. . . . \u2726; He looks the best with his hair with undercut + back. . . . \u2726; My favorite voice color of the group.Clear like water \ud83c\udf0a\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36.\ufe36 . . .. . . \u2312\u2312 \u2727 \u2312 \u2312\u2312 \u2727 -\u02cf\u02cb Felix opinions \u02ce\u02ca- . . . \u2726; I'm surprised that his singing didn't sound awkward in NOEASY. . . . \u2726; I would love to see more of Felix sassy side. . . . \u2726; I want to hear more raps from him like he did in DOMINO. . . . \u2726; His voice is not forced and if you think otherwise you don't even know what is a forced voice.How do you explain his deep voice flowing so effortlessly and naturally if it is forced.

By that I mean that they are always searching for him.

Yes, they are definitely the best rappers of 4th Gen, but when it comes to the 2nd or 3rd gen, I haven\u2019t seen much like them. I think the one that is around the same level is BTS. I mean they are a hip-hop group. 3. They are not as all-rounded as Stays hype them to be. Not all members can be considered rappers or dancers, that\u2019s all I am going to say\u2026 4. Their choreographies are one of the hardest in K-pop. You really can\u2019t deny. Have you seen them? Maniac, Thunderous, God\u2019s Menu, Back Door, District 9, Double Knot, Domino, Levanter, and the list goes on and on. The choreos have intense dance breaks, complicated footwork, lots of technical movements, challenging floorwork, a big amount of balance, popping, I can go on and on, but I am lazy. 5. Stop recognizing Felix for his voice. Yeah, I don\u2019t have anything against his voice, I really like it. However, people almost never recognize him for his dance and rapping. Like, hello? He is part of Dance Racha for a reason. He is a lead rapper for a reason. 6. \u201cStray Kids songs are the same.\u201d Are you dumb? You know the same people produce the songs. They have a genre, and that genre has helped them become the biggest 4th Gen group, gaining intense popularity internationally. How about you care about your faves? Huh, they need you. 7. They are not the BTS 2.0 I hate when people compare them. Stray kids is Stray Kids and will always be. We are stay, we will never be army, so just stop. Imagine the pressure Stray Kids must feel when people call them. Even BTS didn\u2019t want to be called the Next Beatles. 8. The thing about Hyunjin Vs. Lee Know needs to stop. I have seen many people argue about who is the better dancer. Lee Know is the better dancer, but Hyunjin is a better performer and has better Stage Presence. Ok, that is it. Bye",

            "Popular or unpopular, here I come\u2026 \u262e Stray Kids\u2019 rapline is the best in terms of delivery out of all 4th gen groups and in top 3 overall. Say whatever you want, I am a multistan and listen to a lot of k-pop groups so I have heard a lot of raplines. In terms of stage presence, delivery and flow, I feel like Stray Kids stand out from all 4th gen groups. The only other rapline I would say is on a similar level as SKZ is BTS.\u262e Their love for STAYs (their fandom) is genuine.

In terms of stage presence, delivery and flow, I feel like Stray Kids stand out from all 4th gen groups. The only other rapline I would say is on a similar level as SKZ is BTS.\u262e Their love for STAYs (their fandom) is genuine. A lot of idols and artists overall say their fans are their number one and they love them and that\u2019s okay but a lot of the time it feels/sounds rehearsed and fake/spurious. However, I feel like SKZ\u2019s thankfulness for STAYs is genuine. \u262e Felix is the one element that brings the most attention to SKZ. Like it or not, most non-fans recognize Stray Kids solely because of Felix\u2019s deep and easily recognizable voice. And a lot of people started listening to SKZ and have become their fans because of the unique tone of his voice. Me included, he is the one that got me into their music with his vocals in God\u2019s Menu.\u262e They are not the next BTS but they are on the road to becoming worldwide. There will never be the next BTS so stop comparing every k-pop boygroup to them. However, out of all currently active boygroups, Stray Kids are the closest to becoming the next big thing in k-pop worldwide. They already have the second biggest fandom in k-pop.\u262e They have one of the most diverse discographies in k-pop. They don\u2019t stick to one concept. They try different things for every album. Just look at NOEASY? Prefers ballads? There\u2019s The View and Sorry, I love you. Want to listen and dance? You can have Domino or Thunderous. Want something sexy? Red Lights. Fan of alt-rock? Silent Cry. And so on\u2026\u262e They are the most all-rounder group in k-pop. They are all multi-talented. All can dance, sing and rap at least on an average level. None of them are lacking and especially 3RACHA, the backbone of SKZ, excels in producing and songwriting as well. They all speak Korean and English (I would say all of them are at least intermediate in English which is enough to get by). Lee Know and Hyunjin are great MCs too."

If you try to explain what has happened to your friends and family, they will be somewhat sympathetic but will politely suggest that you \u2018let it go and move on with your life\u2019 as though this was just part of life\u2019s bad chapters. Here are a few things to keep in mind: 1. Do not listen to your friends and family. They mean well but unless they have experienced what you have gone through, their advice is not that helpful. Talk to a therapist that specializes in personality disorders. If you cannot afford to see a therapist, talk with a priest, rabbi, religious counselor. You don\u2019t have to be religious to do this, but they will help. They have been trained to work/advise those that have been abused mentally or physically. 2. Go no contact. Go off the grid. No social media, no phone calls to/from the narc, no texting, no interaction of any kind. If your friends or family happen to bring the narc up in conversation, politely tell them that you prefer not to talk about the narc. Any contact or thought or conversation (no matter how innocent you think it will be) will lead you back to a bad place and you will never, ever recover. The narc targeted you because you were a good, vivacious person that was caring and thoughtful. Anything you say or do will get back to the narc and he/she will know that you have not recovered. The narc doesn\u2019t need to know anything about you or what you are doing. When they ghosted you, gas lighted you, disrespected you, cheated on you, ignored you, yelled at you, embarrassed you, hit you, called you names, wouldn\u2019t talk with you, they didn\u2019t care to know how you were feeling or how sad you were or how you were crying or how you were confused or blaming your self \u2013 so why should you give them the opportunity to know anything about you now after they have done all of this to you? 3. You will never change the narc. Just like the sky is blue, you can never change the sky to be green. As much as you think you can help someone, this is one person, you cannot help. If they say, they will change, politely tell them to get professional help first. You cannot help them, they must want to change on their own and with professional help. 4. Stop reliving the past with the narc. This is a hard one, because you are trying to find answers to all the questions running in your head. There are no answers. There are no answers. There are no answers. Repeat. Nothing that you think about the past will give you any relief, it will only give you more questions. 5. Stop thinking about what the narc is doing and with whom. Again, this is a hard one, because you are trying to validate your self-worth. STOP validating yourself through someone. START validating yourself through yourself. Right now, go look in a mirror and just stare at yourself and say the words \u2013 I AM. That\u2019s it. I AM. Those two words validate that you are a person. A person. I AM. As a person, you already have validation. I AM. 6. Forget about getting a hobby, or taking walks (unless you want to), just be yourself. If you want to cry, then cry. If you want to yell, then yell. If you want to sleep all day, then just do it for one day. Do whatever you need to do as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt you or someone else, then take the next day and say I AM. 7. Watch comedy. As silly as this sounds, and as miserable as you are, the Hallmark channel and the dramas are not going to help. Comedy takes you to another place. You already feel bad, so why not feel bad about not laughing? Sounds silly, doesn\u2019t it? Comedy forces you into a realm in which you have not been for a very long time. If you have to binge on comedic movies, TV or Comedy Central, just do it. 8. No alcohol, no drugs. Take this at least one day at a time. When you want to reach for a cocktail or a light, reach for a glass of water in a shot glass, wine glass or pint glass. Treat that water as you would your cocktail. Again, silly right? For each day, you do not drink or drug, you become clearer and clearer as to who you used to be \u2013 a vivacious and outstanding person. 9. Smile and make eye contact at everyone. In the grocery, at work, in your car at the stoplight, even in bed when you are crying and don\u2019t want to get up. It doesn\u2019t matter. Smile. Just smile. Why? Because you have to think about it! Once you think about it, you stop thinking about the tragedy that you just went through. 10. Repeat 1-9. Take care and repeat.",

All their gaslighting will begin to replay in your head like an old horror flick. The rumination of certain things they said and did will hit you like a ton of bricks. You will pass certain places or smell certain scents that surface the torture you thought your buried and forgot. Any mention of them from friends and family will get your stomach turning with self inflicted anxiety. Just the mere mentioning of their name triggers and automatic fight or flight state in your body. No contact is the only way but it will seem impossible at the beginning. You will want to discuss the abuse with friends and family but they soon grow tired of your \u201cbelly aching\u201d and tell you to just get over it. They can\u2019t comprehend what you find attractive in a disgusting human that fucks, sucks, manipulates, lies and cheats on anyone in their path. Drinking is a big no no. I\u2019m one of the idiots that drink then think it\u2019s a good idea to reach out. You will look for anything to distract yourself from feeling the withdrawal symptoms experienced with the addiction to a abusive person. You will want to explain yourself to them one last time in hopes they will finally \u201cget it\u201d that you two could have it all if they would just hear you out. Their actions don\u2019t make sense to you let alone sense to the outside world. The image they portray is pathetic and sick. You know who the fucker is behind all the fake images and money they portray to make but don\u2019t. You will want to call them out so the world can see the lying, cheating, abusive disgusting asshole this person really is. But many already know that because they experienced them first hand also. Some of your behaviors and reactions will be flat out embarrassing. You never dreamed you would react or be this obsessed with someone like this, let alone someone as abusive. The person will literally disgust you but you will crave their touch at the same time. There is no begged feeling of defeat when you think you have this shit in the bag and you get a simple \u201chappy birthday\u201d from them that starts the shit show if a cycle all over again. More importantly, it\u2019s a process and a brutally painful one at that. Grieving this type of relationship takes time. The more you question and try and justify or understand who they are or what they are you will stay in the never ending cycle of self-sabotage. The quicker you decide to go no contact and mean it is the quicker you get to freedom. With the freedom you experience gives you the time to focus on the most important aspect of healing. Yourself.",

There just is not a quick fix because there needs to be a complete unspooling of you, first, in order to understand what happened so it doesn\u2019t happen to you again with the same narcissist or others. The question is how can you heal faster? Here\u2019s my opinion based on my experience: Get validation as much as necessary from outside sources about narcissism. Research on Quora, watch YouTube videos, visit with as many people as you can to validate your experiences with the narcissist because it\u2019s a battle between the real reality of truth and the false one you\u2019ve been in with them. You\u2019re coming out of a cult and you need to deprogram. Once you have enough validation they are a narcissist, then the work begins but you will for a long time need that validation to reground yourself. Accept they are not fixable. Once you know, you go. They are NOT fixable. This is about survival now so abandon them and the thought of them. Recognize and admit this relationship is unhealthy for you and that you are addicted to it. Keep repeating this over and over to yourself. At first, it\u2019s not a matter of will for you to back out if it, which is why it\u2019s so not helpful for people to tell survivors to \u201cGet over it,\u201d or to go find someone else. Would we say that to a heroin addict? An alcoholic? Of course not! Then why is it so odd to conceive we can get addicted to drugs and alcohol but not to a person? All addictions are using outside things to regulate our emotions. This is an addiction- treat it as such. Understand the purpose of and go No Contact with zero exceptions. I think there is a misconception about what No Contact means and the purpose behind it. No Contact is for your benefit and yours only. It\u2019s not a two way conversation with back and forth flow between both parties. It\u2019s a one way statement: \u201cMy life and existence are more important to me than anything else, and continued exposure to this person is going to kill me.\u201d Can an alcoholic manipulate themselves into thinking \u201cOh I\u2019m strong enough to be around alcohol now?\u201d Of course they can. When you finally reach that point where enough is enough is enough and you finally get yourself away from this drug (the narcissist) and go full No Contact you will look back and see all the different ways you tricked yourself into being \u201cNo Contact\u201d but not really being \u201cNo Contact.\u201d You were still seeking interaction with the drug. \u201cOh but we share bills!\u201d \u201cOh but what about his birthday? That\u2019s mean to not reach out to him!\u201d \u201cHer friend asked me how I was doing and told me she was really sad. I should just call to check in.\u201d \u201cI heard his mom is in the hospital!\u201d These are all ways for you to get \u201chigh\u201d off your drug again. Period. There can be no interaction. If you want to survive, turn and run. Look, you can bullshit yourself and be feeling not much different than you do now in 5 or even 10 years, but at some point in order to heal you have to withdraw from your drug and it\u2019s painful. Zero Contact is the only way to go in order to heal. It\u2019s an addiction. No Contact is removing the alcohol permanently from your life. You can\u2019t have a taste of it on Wednesday, a flirt with it on Friday. That is not how you heal from an addiction. It is literally wiping their existence from your person, because you cannot heal from alcoholism when you have a bottle of it on your kitchen table or exposure to it. Likewise you cannot heal from narcissistic abuse when you are in contact with the narcissist who was abusing you and who you are addicted (trauma bonded) to.

A living body fully charged with testosterone (for males ofcourse) , females having a bit better control over themselves. Let's begin. Consider a super typical Indian teenager.Typically wakes up at somewhere between 5 am to 8 am (The range being directly proportional to the strictness of the parents)Brush their teeth , thinking either about what they have studied the last night(Some serious IIT and NEET aspirants) or regretting about not studying the day before. Then promising to themselves to study for 12 hours that day.Either goes for tuition classes or sits to study , with a book opened in front of them. Then after 15 mins , finding oneself thinking stuffs like Suniyo ke papa karta kya hoga (What does Suniyo's father do?) or do colleges like St Teresa really exist and such other useless stuff.After 2 hours of successfully wasting thinking about such stuff and some studying , the teen gets up to take a bath.Then gets ready for the school. Goes to school , catch up with the friends , stalk their crush during tiffin break or the lucky ones sit beside their babu/sona/janu and think of the name of their 3rd kid .Comes back home. Eats something. Gets ready for another tuition . Goes to the tuition . Catch up with another bunch of friends. The sincere ones sit on the first bench while the not so sincere ones get themselves comfortable on the last bench.Then from the conversation comes to know that there was homework which he/she forgot to do. Then the teacher comes and start teaching.While some listen to the teachers while some others opt for using the phone under the desk as things being taught were still going above their heads.The class gets over. Calls their parents that the class got dismissed. Comes back home. The parents ask what had been taught and they answer them superficially(mostly) .Have dinner. Gets back to study once again. Then realize that they have to check their phone as they haven't for last 30 min. Checks their phone and reply to the messages . Sees their crush/girlfriend online , talks to them for next one hour.Opens Instagram. Scrolls down , liking the memes and vines and funny cat posts. Then stumbles upon some hot chick pics .Closes Instagram. Turns on Auto Rotation. Turns on Incognito mode.

Unexplained time absences or being late all the time , saying they had a flat tire or they ran out off gas coming back from work freshly showered with different clothes on with a smug grin7. Saying they are not that hungry when you have dinner on the table as they have already ate with a supply on a date8. Telling you they are giving you a quick call inside a bathroom fast food place , nope they are in a supplies bathroom9. Having a change of clothes in their car at all times , cologne, condoms and erection pills if male . They also stop letting you ride in their vehicle or drive it and now keep it locked at all times .10.

PHONE USAGE:If he takes his phone everywhere, even the bathroom.If he walks to another room or outside to answer calls.If he turns the sound off on the phone.If he makes sure to lay it face down so notifications can't be seen.If he suddenly puts a new password on the phone so you can't look at it.If you ask to use his phone and he refuses.If he puts privacy glass over the screen.If he claims to be playing games on it a lot but without sound to identify that it's really a game.If he claims to be texting family or friends all the time but didn't text them before.If his contacts have a lot of generic names like \u201cdoctor\" \u201clawyer\" \u201cboss\" etc or family members he never talked to.If he gets texts at 3:00 a.m.If he glances at his phone when it rings but doesn't answer it when you're nearby and then has to run an errand or walk the dog soon afterwards.OUT OF CHARACTER BEHAVIORHe takes more showers, especially after being out.He is more careful with his appearance (shaving more, using teeth whitening strips, wearing cologne)He buys new underwear.He dresses better.He has to run errands a lot whereas in the past, he asked you to do it.He asks you to drive to the other side of town for something he must have.He has a lot more meetings, doctor and dentist appointments come up that he \u201cforgot\u201d to mention until he's on his way out the door.There are unexplained or poorly explained absences and being late for dates with you.If you ask where he's been, he accuses you of trying to control him.He starts fights that make no sense and then storms out of the house for hours.CHANGES IN THE BEDROOMHe is suddenly uninterested in sex. (especially if he has always been highly sexual)He pushes you to have sex only when he knows you don't want it.

However, if you start noticing a lot of these things happening, it is a good indication that something is changing in your relationship. At that point, be watchful and trust your instincts. Unless you're just a naturally suspicious, jealous and paranoid person, your gut will steer you in the right direction.",

Electricity and gas lines\u2026a fire or explosion waiting to happen. Youtube is our friend, in most cases. But a few things to keep in mind;The codes can change from state to state and what you do not want to have happen is you go through all the work only to find out after what you did is \u201coff\u201d by even a little because if you ever have a problem (like a leak that floods your house) and turn it into your insurance company for damages they could deny paying anything because you didn\u2019t do it to code.If/when you go to sell your house the buyer may insist on a full inspection and if they find something not done right you will be paying for it then.That Billy Buck Bodine showing you the short cuts and how to save money may not know what the hell they are doing, or I swear some of these how to hack vids (like increase your internet speed wearing a hat made out of tin foil) are a joke and the person that put it up is laughing their ass off knowing there are people walking around looking like a major idiot.Or the business that puts up a how to vid makes it look so complicated that most people won\u2019t even try and call them in to do the job.Do your homework, look at lots of instructionals, consider the source of each one and do it right the first time.",

There are many types of piping systems made out of many types of materials with many different fittings and many different ways to connect them using many different kinds of tools. There's also a substantially sized code book full all sorts of rules and regulations governing the accepted practices of plumbing. I learned what I know by joining the plumbers union and fullfilling a 5 year apprenticeship where I learned on the job 40 hrs a week plus night school 2 nights a week for 5 years, turning out as a journeyman plumber in June 2000. We start off earning 40% of journeyman rate and get a 5% raise every 6 months until we turn out , the final raise being 15% . We show up with work boots and overalls. Everything else is provided by the employer . The OJT provided by our brothers and occasional sisters (women are more than welcome, there just aren't a whole lot of them who apply. The application is an apptitude test that's given annually when times are good, to be determined when times are slow. The test is similar to the ASVAB.

Steve boldly declared that nobody would want to buy a phone with a big screen, a perception that surrounded much of the industry at the time. Fast forward several years, and the common perception now is that the larger the screen you can fit into the device, the better, as long as the overall footprint remains manageable. The idea of a 5.8-inch display was off the table in 2011, yet modern advances have made it entirely possible. I have no doubt that Steve had a good idea in his mind of how Apple would progress, and how the road ahead would look. However, that does not mean that all of his ideas would have led to competitive products by today\u2019s standards if they had been followed to the letter. Would Steve have been crazy over every product Apple has released since 2011? Perhaps not. After all, there\u2019s a different captain at the helm, with different ideas. However, Steve placed a strong emphasis on the values of leading design, ease of use and quality service. Apple 2018 retains these core values and the iPhone X is a product of those values. Steve was a visionary and a game-changer, taken way too soon.The great man. However, the idea that Apple is utterly lost without him is getting a little long in the tooth. Apple as a company has no future if it constantly looks over its shoulder at what Steve would have wanted. He strongly advised Tim Cook to follow his own way. To his credit, considering Apple\u2019s recent success, I think Tim is doing a good job. Is the iPhone X the iPhone that Steve Jobs imagined in 2011? Probably not. Does it contain Apple\u2019s core values? Yes. Would he have appreciated that? Absolutely.",

It\u2019s just that we did not think it was important enough a factor to be considered. Users will just get used to a part of their display(video/photo/anything) getting cropped off eventually. Steve: You\u2019re fired.Steve: I heard the wireless charging is futuristic. Glad we didn\u2019t just make a charging pad like our competitors did years ago. True wireless charging is the right way to go after all. Engineer 3: Actually Steve, we haven\u2019t achieved true wireless charging. Users still need to put their phone on the charging pad to charge it. Steve: You\u2019re fired.Steve: And who decided to let go of the Touch Id ? Engineer 4: Me ! Steve: You\u2019re fired.Steve: How foolproof is the Face Id? How does it differentiate between identical twins? What about the special cases when a user covers face due to religious reasons / wears a pollution mask / helmet / puts on makeup? How is a user supposed to unlock a phone after being dressed up at a Halloween Party? Engineer 5 : The user has to stick to the good old method of entering a password for all such cases. Steve: You\u2019re fired.Steve: At least I am happy that we have caught up to fast charging. Even phones at one-fifth of our price have been using it for a while now. It\u2019ll be convenient for the users to be able to charge their phones quickly. Engineer 6 : Well, the newer iPhone does support fast charging but the bundled charger does not. Users will have to separately buy a Lightning-to-USB-C cable and a USB-C Power Delivery-compatible charger if they want to charge their phones faster. Steve: You\u2019re fired.Steve: Tell me something the iPhone X can do which our competitors cannot. Engineers: The Animoji feature - You can turn your facial expressions into a grinning pile of poop on the iPhone X !Steve : iQuit. P.S. No pun intended in that last statement!",

However, a bigger concern actually looms over the horizon. Forget all of the inconclusive studies about cellphones and cancer for the last few decades. The presenter of the lecture, Paul Ben-Ishai, showed that the human sweat gland could absorb electromagnetic energies within 77 to 110 Ghz. This is well within the drafted electromagnetic range of 5G, and thus, any 5G network can and will affect the human body in some way. The absorption rate is made worse if the sweat gland is forced to work more, like during heavy physical activity. It may cause some sort of skin disease that progresses to something much worse. Or, the energy may simply be dissipated as additional body heat. The research remains inconclusive, and like the cellphones versus cancer debate, significant medical data may not be immediately available for many years. To be fair, this does not conclude that 5G is bad. The point is just that more studies are needed before we can actually implement the technology. It is possible that the slow transition could help accumulate usage data while it still hasn\u2019t taken over yet. However, large-scale 5G infrastructure rollout projects may require this critical research data before being signed off. All in all, while it may not be apparent now, the upcoming 5G network protocol is set to be game-changing in mobile technology. Just as 3G took the world by storm 15 or so years ago, 5G could set new technology standards for homes, offices, other spaces. At least to those countries that can afford the brand new infrastructure.Credit image: 5G So how will 5G impact the future of work? Well, for starters, we can expect faster data transfer speeds. That's going to improve our ability to make sense of big data and gain insights from data analytics. We also know that emerging technologies like IoT, AR and VR will be easily supported by 5G. In particular, IoT is likely to be a game changer for many sectors, particularly industrial, manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and supply chain. 5G will underpin the adoption of IoT. 5G will also allow autonomous vehicles to communicate effectively and could kickstart a self-driving revolution. This will extend to the workplace. We know that Amazon already uses 100,000 autonomous warehouse robots to help with fulfillment. This is just the beginning. And then there is the trend towards digital nomadism and remote working, with one in three employees expected to be based away from the office in a decade or so. Remote workers will have seemingly instantaneous connectivity, so will be able to access files and participate in live HD meetings without any performance issues. Business communications and networking will benefit from a makeover too. In fact, if 5G becomes the boon that is expected to be, then the sci-fi inspired augmented reality live conferences of the big screen may just be a few years ahead of us.Hope you like the answer!

Dump them out into a zip loc bag and crush them into a very finely ground powder. As fine as you can Then when your roommate isn't around go into their bathroom and remove their shower head. Stuff it full (but not overly full) of the powder. Put the head back on and make sure the water flows. When your roommate takes a hot shower the powder will dissolve but still come out clear. It's almost impossible to recognize. They get out of the shower and when they dry off they're incredibly sticky. Like to an absurd level. And what do people do when they're sticky? That's right, take another shower. There's normally enough powder to keep this going for well over an hour of showers. My last roommate was slowly going crazy. Stuck to the couch, everything stuck to his skin. It was amazing. For some reason these work the best. In college we did a controlled experiment with sugar, Caro syrup, other flavors of life savors, werthers, and a few other things. Nothing came out to the level of stickiness and longevity of one shower head load as the butter rum life savors. Just one of over 100 things I have from a wonderful book that was passed down in my family. My grandfather started it when he was in the army, my dad added to it when he went to college, and I added a few chapters. It'll go to one of my daughters before they go to college."
