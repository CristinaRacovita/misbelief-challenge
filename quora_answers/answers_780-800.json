            "Are you attracted to blondes and brunettes?  Then how could you possibly be monogamous? If you commit to a blonde, won't you always long for the sight of dark hair between your fingers? If you commit to a brunette, won't you crave sunlight on golden strands? You like both, so you must need both, right?  Of course not! Blondes and brunettes aren't different in any way that matters! Yes. That's exactly how I feel about men and women. To be clear, there are of course average differences between men and women. Men, on average, are taller than women, on average. And yet, if I were especially attracted Continue ReadingAre you attracted to blondes and brunettes?  Then how could you possibly be monogamous? If you commit to a blonde, won't you always long for the sight of dark hair between your fingers? If you commit to a brunette, won't you crave sunlight on golden strands? You like both, so you must need both, right?  Of course not! Blondes and brunettes aren't different in any way that matters! Yes. That's exactly how I feel about men and women. To be clear, there are of course average differences between men and women. Men, on average, are taller than women, on average. And yet, if I were especially attracted to tall people, I could date a tall man or a tall woman. The same is true for any quality you care to name. There are no qualities unique to men, and there are no qualities unique to women. I like to date brilliant, charming nerds. I can date brilliant, charming male nerds, and I can date brilliant, charming female nerds. I date them because they're nerds, not because they're men or women.  Monosexuals often have this idea that bisexual people are attracted to men and women because men and women are different, and we want the experience of dating men and the experience of dating women. I've met a few bisexuals who fit that pattern. They have a male-shaped slot in their life, and a female-shaped slot in their life, and if one slot remains unfilled for a while, they get itchy to fill it again. But most bisexuals I've talked to don't work that way. We don't yearn for \"maleness\" or \"femaleness,\" because we don't find those categories particularly useful. We yearn for nerdiness or elegance or athleticism or street-smarts or activism or generosity -- the qualities that shape the way someone behaves in the world and in a relationship.  So for me, my attraction to both men and women is just like your attraction to blondes and brunettes, or dancers and soccer players, or artists and mathematicians, or wallflowers and drama queens. You like people with different qualities. So do I. You don't need to be involved with all those types of people at once. Neither do I.  The funny thing is, I'm not monogamous! And I'm bisexual! But I'm not non-monogamous because I'm bisexual. I didn't reject monogamy because I need to be involved with a woman and a man at the same time. For most of my ten years of non-monogamy, I have only been involved with men. And I have never found myself thinking, \"Gosh, I should go out and find a woman to date.\" My non-monogamy and my bisexuality are completely orthogonal, except perhaps that being outside the sexual mainstream made me slightly more open to consider other non-mainstream options like polyamory.",
            "My answer would be: how can you know better than bisexuals themselves? Don't you think that is a bit arrogant, to say that you know more about this than people who actually are bisexual? If you'd read up on bisexuality, instead of repeating myths you have heard, you would find that most bisexuals are as monogamous as straight/gay/lesbian people are. The number of bisexuals involved in polyamory is, in some researches, slightly higher than in the mono-sexual group, but it still is a very small percentage. And since researches really have trouble finding out the right numbers (hey, we don't even Continue ReadingMy answer would be: how can you know better than bisexuals themselves? Don't you think that is a bit arrogant, to say that you know more about this than people who actually are bisexual? If you'd read up on bisexuality, instead of repeating myths you have heard, you would find that most bisexuals are as monogamous as straight/gay/lesbian people are. The number of bisexuals involved in polyamory is, in some researches, slightly higher than in the mono-sexual group, but it still is a very small percentage. And since researches really have trouble finding out the right numbers (hey, we don't even know how many people actually are gay or lesbian or bisexual), that 'slightly higher' may be the outcome of one research and not be representative of bisexuals in general. The thing about bisexuality is that it is a vast terrain. It is not simply that they want to have sex with everything. If that would be the case, your friend might have a point. But that's not how it is. We also don't know how it works that some women are attracted to women only, others to men only, and others to both, and others (also) to any or all of the binary identities in the middle. It's not a matter of genitals, are straight people attracted to each other on basis of their genitals? Of course they're not. Neither are we. Neither are gay or lesbian people. Sexual orientation is way more than whom you want to have sex with. The heterosexual is not only interested in sex with someone of the opposite sex, they also want relationships, share their lives together, go to the movies and so on and so forth. The homosexual is also not only interested in sex with someone of the same sex. That's exactly how it works for bisexuals. We want sex, but we also want relationships. In that we are no different. We only have more genders to choose from. That doesn't necessarily mean that we need more than one gender to be happy. I know polyamorous bisexuals who have a whole bunch of relationships and all with the same gender. So even for polyamorous bisexuals it's not necessarily about having both genders.",

The depth of their gaze, the intensity of expression, all revealed unspoken secrets.The way his eyes lit up at the sight of my own joy. We were watching a comedy show. I threw back my head, a loud, cackling laugh erupting from my stomach. When I opened my eyes again, I saw that he wasn\u2019t watching the show. Instead, his blissful gaze was locked on me. The way his eyes welled up when I was upset. He grabbed my hand and asked me to stay. To listen. He earnestly looked into my face, trying to alleviate my fears, to soothe my insecurities, to show me he was on my side. I heard his words, but it was his melting, warm eyes that told me he always would be on my side. The way his eyes remained calm in my presence. They never flashed frightening anger towards me. They remained peaceful prisms, a constant source of comfort. Once, I forgot about our dinner cooking and let it burn to a crisp. His eyes crinkled at the corners in a tinkling, reassuring smile. He laughingly drew me towards him, his arms enveloping me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, we\u2019ll order pizza.\u201d The way his eyes radiated distress at my own discomfort. I was sick and told him he shouldn\u2019t come near me, he\u2019d only get sick too. I started heaving out great, racking coughs, my nose running into a tissue. He looked at me, his eyes the deepest pools of sincerity. Without any doubts, he told me he wasn\u2019t going anywhere. The way he watched me when I wasn\u2019t looking. I woke up, stretching and grunting into the consciousness of the morning. I opened my eyes to see him watching me, the most honeyed, doting look on his face. I was lying breathless after sex, and I turned to see his enraptured expression, his eyes burning with passionate fervor. In that moment, his eyes emitted a fierce affection. I was curled up on the couch, deeply engrossed in a book. I looked up to see him sitting across the room from me, watching me with a look of pure contentedness. Upon locking eyes with me he moved towards me, wrapping himself around my body, breathing softly into my skin. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked him, bemusedly. \u201cI\u2019m just enjoying you. I\u2019m appreciating you.\u201d he said, looking up at me with those shining globes. In that moment, they were my whole world.

One day she was making us both baguettes and she kept the nice inside bit and I got the ends ... again!  This time I just didn't bother to eat the ends. My mother was aghast!!

            "This is simply my experience, but I can say this - oldness is strange. 1) You age on the outside but forget to age on the inside.

That's exactly like being old. The person inside is still you. You haven't changed your sense of self. You still expect the same things of yourself. It's just that the world sees you in a completely different way. Which brings me to my next point... 2) Invalidation.

That's exactly like being old. The person inside is still you. You haven't changed your sense of self. You still expect the same things of yourself. It's just that the world sees you in a completely different way. Which brings me to my next point... 2) Invalidation. Nobody cares about old people, or even about middle aged people. You are practically invisible. You can be replaced by some new graduates out of college who will work for essentially minimum wage. You will be retired early to make way for those grads, and possibly some unpaid interns. Nobody will feel the need to be particularly nice to you. Nobody will expect you to know anything or be connected to the world. However, in some ways this is valuable - you never were a beautiful and unique snowflake but now you have proof. You also realize that youth is a decent substitute for beauty but keep in mind that you are creepy if you notice in any meaningful way. 3) More socially aware. You don't live in the me-me-me bubble of youth anymore. You recognize that other people actually exist (barring certain perceptual disabilities). You are more considerate and aware of other peoples' requirements. Relationships change. You are more patient. You try to keep surpluses of things, just in case someone you care about would need them (food, money, umbrellas, manners, tissues...). 4) More aware of the necessities and requirements of money. You recognize that money is not just to buy Doritos, but also to pay for ridiculously expensive things that your children need, like college educations, weddings, first homes, lawyers, automobiles, business startups... the list is unbelievably long and insanely costly. Total that list up - it's at least $3/4Million (and going up every day). And then there are your own expenses like retirement, healthcare, and perhaps a little travel. These things force you to become a monetary hoarder, saving like a squirrel before a bitter winter. It makes no sense on a global scale, but that's how the world works. You either deal with it or it deals with you. 5) Your friends get old. They live far away. You see them occasionally when they are in town for business. You exchange Christmas emails. Then they start having health problems. Personally, my friends are starting to have this. Eventually, they start having serious health problems and even dying. This is some scary stuff. It asks you to deal with your own mortality in a way that wasn't quite real before. And over time, people disappear to the point where you are essentially on your own. Personally, I think a lot of people allow themselves to die because everyone else has and they don't want to be left out. Not to be morbid, but there it is. 6) The war between those who change with the times and those who stay the same. Most people decide 'who they are' in college or somewhere thereabouts. And they never move very far from there. This is why generations have a certain character and taste in clothing, foods, media, etc. However, the world moves on. Some will recognize this and change with the times. Those who change are trapped - not wallowing in the past but (as noted above) rejected by the younger, more in-the-present crowd. Hence the term 'hipster' - noun, old French, One who is aware of what is actually going on in the world and shall be punished for it. Clearly it only works in certain enclaves, and even then doesn't work all that well. This list is not exhaustive but hopefully gives you some idea. The heyday is over.",

When we\u2019re in our teens, we can\u2019t wait to be adult so we can drive, buy booze, buy a house, get married\u2014have all the freedom adults have. Wait, what? I could\u2019ve sworn I was going to have a ton of freedom once I got to be an adult. As it turned out, I spent a lot of energy and attention in other areas: learning how to be a husband, then a dad. I had to figure out what I wanted to do and be when I grew up. That was a process of trial and error, and even after I finally found a career I wanted to stick with, it still feels as though I\u2019m playing the whole thing by ear sometimes\u2014fake it \u2018till you make it. So here I am at the tail end of a career in finance that I\u2019ve enjoyed most of the time. I have enough money to do most of the things I want. I still earn a very good income, but Social Security and Medicare provide a certain amount of peace of mind and security. I feel the same now at this age that I always have\u2026mostly. Occasionally, I\u2019ll see myself in a photo and think, \u201cWho\u2019s that old dude?\u201d Oh. I wonder if it\u2019s just a trick of the light or the camera angle, but know it\u2019s just a photo of a septuagenarian\u2014me. Surprise. I\u2019ve always been healthy. There have even been long periods when I had no health insurance. That means I\u2019ve always been lucky, too. Five years ago, at age 67, I had an interesting experience: the right side of my body wasn\u2019t behaving properly. I chalked it up initially to having slept funny, but when I couldn\u2019t brush my teeth, I knew there was a real problem. I called my HMO. They asked me some questions\u2014and keep in mind, I felt fine\u2014and they told me to have someone drive me to emergency immediately. I told them I\u2019d just drive myself, but they said that was not an option. So I called a friend who lived nearby. She drove me to emergency, where they hooked me up to an IV and a lot of machines. As it turned out, I was having what they called a \u201cminor stroke.\u201d Technically, it was a Transient Ischemic Attack [edited from my previous incorrect reference, \u201cTemporal\u201d] , which sounds a lot more serious. It was the combination of high cholesterol and high blood pressure that caused it. Fortunately, I got treatment in time, and have no permanent impairment. Quite the contrary: it was a life-enhancing experience. I came to the realization\u2014probably for the first time in my life\u2014that I am not invincible. I resolved to take my health seriously. I went back to the gym twice a week and began running four days a week. I lost about 30 pounds and got my blood pressure and cholesterol under control. Most importantly, though, I established my new running habit, which has enhanced my life significantly in many ways. When you get to a certain age, your friends start dying. When I was just out of high school, a classmate died of cancer. It was just an abstract concept to me at that time. When my grandmother passed away suddenly, at 82 (I was 33) I remember sitting in my car before going to work, unexpectedly seized by grief, sobbing. But her death was somehow removed to anything I might experience. When people around your own age get sick from various maladies connected with getting older, little by little, you start to feel that reality. A dear friend of mine, twenty years younger than I, died unexpectedly from the diabetes she\u2019d had (and managed successfully) since childhood. Another friend, twelve years older than I, is in hospice, comfortable but fading. We\u2019ve had a close and rewarding friendship for almost three decades. As I watch him peacefully preparing for the inevitability of death, I wonder how I\u2019ll be. We all know intellectually that we\u2019re not going to be here forever, but it takes losing old friends to aging to bring that reality home emotionally. I still work (by choice) and manage to stay healthy and very active (I ran a half marathon a week after I turned 70). Between the intellectual stimulation of my work (I run a branch of a national mortgage company) and regular vigorous exercise, I figure that however many days are allotted to me are damn sure going to be quality ones. As I watch many of my contemporaries age, I realize that my intellectual pursuits (I\u2019m a free-lance writer in addition to my day job) and my exercise habits will to some extent slow the march of time. Still, I am increasingly aware of the things I once thought I\u2019d do at some point, but now know there simply isn\u2019t enough time. It\u2019s a sobering thought, but when I look back at all the wonderful aspects of the life I\u2019ve been able to lead\u2014a wife who\u2019s been steadfast for nearly half a century, grandchildren who think Papa\u2019s the coolest person on the planet, and daughters who grudgingly acknowledge that I\u2019ve gotten smarter\u2014I realize it\u2019s been a pretty sweet ride.",

But at about that age she once told me that she still felt 16 inside, and now I know what she meant. She's 82 now. My dad will be 90 in a few months. That's old. I'm not really old. But I do feel old sometimes, especially on Quora where it seems almost everyone is less than half my age, and some less than a third. Being a young person is like being a stem cell. You might go anywhere, become anything. You are all about potential. When you get to be my age you are considered to be fully formed as a human being, the sum of your past experience.  I am afraid that someday I'll be unable to learn to use new technologies (I got my parents a Kindle Fire for Christmas and sat with them to show them how to use it and they are both entirely flummoxed by it, will probably never use it unless I am sitting there coaching them), and I would hate that, because every new thing I've ever learned how to do has been such an improvement in my life to date. When I was young I used to say that I couldn't wait to be 35, because I figured I'd have all my shit together by the time I was 35. FAIL The pluses: I've been through a lot, and I know a lot. I've had a huge amount of experience in navigating business and personal issues. Thanks to all those years of experience I've got some perspective that a younger person just can't have. I have witnessed with my own eyes a period of astonishing change in human history, politics, business, and technology. That, too, gives me some perspective. When I was a little girl there were very few women lawyers, doctors, Senators, scientists, CEOs, or other professional role models for me beyond teachers and nurses. Today there are women in just about every field of endeavor.The minuses: my metabolism has slowed down a lot. I'm less flexible than I used to be. My stamina for walking is still very good, but since breaking an ankle a few years ago I have a touch of arthritis in that ankle (as the orthopedist warned me I would) and it bothers me in cold weather (and sometimes in warm weather too). I have less energy than I did 20 years ago. Thanks to my swarthy Mediterranean forebears I don't have many wrinkles yet, but my hair is mostly silver (it started when I was 15). The neutrals: I'm both more and less patient than I used to be. I have a lot less tolerance for bullshit than I used to, but a lot more tolerance for the foibles of human nature. I'm much more conscious of mortality in general (my own and that of others), and quicker to speak the words \"I love you\" to my family and closest friends. I used to be more trusting, more inclined to take people at face value. Having been betrayed a few times, I am now more discriminating in deciding whom to trust. I've had three or four learner's permits in my life but never actually got a driver's license. I wish I had gotten my license when I was young and felt immortal and untouchable. Today I am so hyperaware of the risks inherent in driving (hell, in life itself) that I sometimes fear I'll never get one. But I'm planning to give it one more shot this spring/summer.  %^> UPDATED MARCH 2014 TO ADD: since writing this answer in the spring of 2012, I've aged two more years, lost my mother, and almost lost my father (who continues in fragile health).  I also got my driver's license in November 2013, and have already used it to drive thousands of miles in trips back and forth between Baltimore and Washington DC, visiting my brother and my father, not to mention local errands etc. in Portland. Looks like I did this just in time. I'm only sorry that I'll never get to fulfill my original purpose in getting the license: to chauffeur my dad around now that he can't drive anymore. He mostly travels by ambulance these days. As I observed above, I'm not really old. I'm middle-aged. You might say I'm in late middle age. But if you're lucky, and you get to be 50+ with your parents still alive, one of the things that happens as you get older is that you have to deal with the decline and eventual loss of your parents. This is more difficult than I could possibly convey with words. If you're young, try to enjoy your parents. I know that sounds insane for many young people -- I couldn't do it either. But if you can, do it. Build strong relationships with your siblings too. When you get to be my age, you'll be glad. UPDATED APRIL 2014 TO ADD: I lost my father less than 24 hours after writing that last update. Hug your parents and your siblings today, if you can, and if they aren't nearby, tell them you love them. It's later than you think.",

My sister wasn\u2019t so lucky. She died from pancreatic cancer about 5 or so weeks before her 52d birthday. That means that although she did not know it, middle age for her was in her mid-20\u2019s. I\u2019ve survived a lot of stuff,--some nearly deadly assaults, DCIS in one breast, some scares concerning calcium deposits in the other breast, blood seepage in 2015 for over 12 hours (If a friend hadn\u2019t intervened with the ER doc, I\u2019d probably be dead!). I could list one or two additional things. A few of my friends call me a fighter, I would say that they are probably right. I go to PT generally twice a week because most of my lumbar cartilage is gone. A few of my friends are just a little insensitive about the fact that for me, shoving a shopping cart around a store for around an hour or so while still on my feet is exercise! Don\u2019t believe me? Ask one of my PT\u2019s! I am proud of the fact that despite pain every day, I almost never take anything for pain. I do yoga once a week with Mr. Slightly-Less-Sensitive. None of us is perfect. None of us came into the world that way, regardless of what your parents may have told you! My mother didn\u2019t want me to get used to any concessions. I am coming to understand that she may have been at least a bit of a narcissist, based on comments on what I\u2019ve written previously. She isn\u2019t around to confront. Nor is Dad, who enabled her. That said, I am very lucky. I have friends of a variety of ages, orientations, religious backgrounds, and ethnicities. It is, however, a little hard to adjust to being compared to a second or third grandma by some of my very young friends. But I will be 67 in early September, and one of them is about 19, so yeah, I guess I am grandma-like since he sometimes asks me for advice. I think that he often uses it too. The other thing is that I look for things I can genuinely compliment people on. Do you know that if you recognize strength-training arms and say something to a person about them you will make that person happy? Or that if you say, \u201cThank you for working today!\u201d you will thrill someone? If you don\u2019t believe me, try it. If you see a short woman (probably in leggings) with platinum silver hair up in some fashion shoving a cart around a store in Montgomery County, MD and saying, \u201cThank you for working today\u201d while wearing a mask, it could be that that person is me! Life isn\u2019t easy, but I\u2019ve had a few family members, friends, and work colleagues who were younger than I am when they died from various things. Almost no one I\u2019ve ever known has died as a result of anything they\u2019ve said to someone else, although I came close (Never use a phrase like, \u201cThat\u2019s a fake gun!\u201d). Try to enjoy the life that you have. If you can make yours better without making someone else\u2019s worse, do so. I consider myself very lucky in my friends, some of my family, and some of my acquaintances. Sometimes relationships must be pruned or uprooted. I have done that in some cases and had that done to me. Learn from the mistakes that don\u2019t kill you and teach someone else about the things that you learn! I have had some great experiences, some horrible experiences, some weird experiences, and some that were \u201cnormal\u201d (whatever that means). Like a partially baked cookie, I don\u2019t feel that I am \u201cdone\u201d with life yet. I am hoping despite my health issues to beat not just my Mom\u2019s age (almost 73), but Dad\u2019s (82), but without the Alzheimer\u2019s. As I have been telling my PT\u2019s the last few evaluations, \u201cThere comes a point when you realize that certain things may only improve marginally. When you realize this, it is important not to allow yourself to backslide too much!\u201d This describes the situation with my lumbar cartilage. We are working on strengthening my arms, legs and hips. Sometimes it hurts a lot. But I\u2019d rather be alive with some pain than not be alive. I hope that whatever trials and tribulations you may have that you feel the same way! Best wishes to all!",

From the smallest of things such as grocery shopping, to big stuff like paying your bills , whether you like it or not, you will have to learn to do it by yourself.Personality buildup: I learnt to be a stronger person. More than anything else, I became more disciplined and organized and learnt to pick up after myself. You also tend to become more brave as a person and learn how not to make mountains out of mole holes.Cooking: This probably is not a common pro, but for me it was one of the biggest changes I have seen in myself. I never bothered too much about learning to cook mainly because I wasn\u2019t interested. But living alone, I was forced into doing it for survival. I still do not enjoy it but hey, I atleast know the basics now.Solitude: Oh, how I love my \u2018Me-Time\u2019. Being alone has given me the chance to actually spend time for myself and not have to give an answer to anyone about it. I can spend the whole day just being at home and doing absoltely nothing, and yet not getting bored.Hosting friends: It gets so much more easier to invite and host friends over and realise that you have absolute no restrictions on anything .(Expect loud noise complaints from your neighbours, if at all :P )Cons:It could get a little lonely at times. Especially during winters when it is all dark and grey. This is when I tend to get home sick the most.As stated in the other answers, medical emergencies. It is quite self explanatory.Biggest con for me: I think living alone can sometimes make me too independent that the thought of having to share the same space with someone can be terrfiying.Overall, the pros outweigh the cons in a large way and I wouldn\u2019t have it in any other way. :)",

People help you mark the passing of time, and the distorted version of time-without-people can\u2019t be understood from the outside. People eat your emotions; having big emotions around other people, in itself, is a form of processing. In isolation, those emotions fester or atrophy. Some feelings crumble and blow away like dust, other linger, maddeningly, like a mouthfull of hair. My mind copes in ways I didn\u2019t expect. Without other options, I manufacture a sense of belonging. I drink coffee with other people. We don\u2019t talk or even look at each other, but I like the feeling that we drink coffee together. I hate traffic less than I used to, because traffic is one of my main group activities. I feel like a mobile fishbowl operator. I\u2019m grateful when people look in, when they pretend not to notice the glass, but I\u2019m fragile too, and overly sentimental. For at least an evening in late August, the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever, ever seen, in person, worked at the local Bed, Bath, and Beyond. For whatever reason, it didn\u2019t register on her face, as it does with most women, that I\u2019m a goon, and that I should not get the wrong idea. For the unusual kindness of sparing me that pursed, grimacing, clenched service-worker smile\u2014nobody owes me anything\u2014I expressed my deep gratitude, by showing no sign of it. These modern ironies. I have a new appreciation for the oddly idiomatic expression \u201cin person.\u201d To meet someone in person, in a body, touchable, rather than merely of person, perhaps. I know no one in my new, small town, and I can no longer meet people as I did in the past, through music, sports, or once upon a time, church. Aside from my ex wife or her parents, with whom I chat when I visit my sons, I only speak in person when I order coffee, or when I say uh-huh to someone asking me, Did you find everything alright? Right now, my sons seem to use the same word for ball and for book and it\u2019s strange to feel more camaraderie with them than anyone else. They\u2019re the only ones I really talk to. It feels really important to tell them things they cannot possibly understand\u2014that I love them, that I think they do an amazing job of being 18 months old, and that I miss them so much when I am not there. My online \u2018relationships\u2019 have an outsized reality to them. More of my heart goes to digital representations than to flesh and bone. A blonde woman on a motorcycle reminds me of Necia, even though I\u2019ve never seen Necia on a motorcycle. A big smile makes me think of Claire\u2019s avatar. I wonder what Michael would think of an article in The Atlantic. Something about Mark Ruffalo seems to suggest Marc Bodnick, or vice-versa. When my closest friend on Quora, the one I openly messaged with, deactivated her account, it affected my actual life. I miss her. Even when I think of people I know from real life, the images in my head come from their Facebook accounts. Dying alone is the least of my concerns. The internet joke about people pairing up so they won\u2019t die alone is completely lost on me. Living alone, the thing that actually matters, isn\u2019t funny at all. Nothing new ever happens to me, so becoming alone is always the most recent thing that happened. The past [the short version: religious, poor health \u00bb married \u00bb got medication \u00bb built a career \u00bb pregnant \u00bb drugs stopped working \u00bb twins \u00bb wife left, moved away \u00bb I followed, still sick, having lost religion and thus the majority of my friends] is available for endless scrutiny. I should have planned better. I should also stop thinking about that. Nothing new has happened for me to think about. My dreams have no new characters. Most nights I dream that my wife has decided to leave me. I don\u2019t understand why isolated people become shooters, and I don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t understand. I should probably be bitter, right? I worry that my lack of bitterness betrays a terrible complacency. I should feel a global schadenfreude, but all I feel is heartbreaking hope for the world. I yearn for people to enjoy their youth and their health. I celebrate their successes and suffer their losses. Even my ex, in an exclusive relationship only six months after our divorce, I feel happy and worried for. I can\u2019t tell the difference anymore, between solipsism and its exact opposite. In many ways the world seems unreal, like it\u2019s my dream. My once natural sense of connection to what happens when I\u2019m not around is now a mythological one. I\u2019m part of us, or we are all an illusion. We are all each other, I hope. I don\u2019t want to be a writer, but life wants me to be one. This is an embarrassing question to have such a detailed answer for. But, right now, writing it is my only way of carving Adam was here into the tree. And I have no guarantees that my sons will always know me. This is also a letter to them. Maybe a bad one, but I was here. I understand the \u2018coming out\u2019 paradigm better. People feel a need to be \u201cout,\u201d explicitly, about their sexuality or their mental health or their past. It\u2019s not much different with total isolation, except that part of me feels like maybe people shouldn\u2019t talk about it. Illogical shame. This is me, trying to be out.",

There is, however, one animal who can beat the butterfly. That is the Mantis Shrimp. The Mantis Shrimp lives in warm, shallow waters, and grows about 15-30 cms in length (6-12 inches). This marvellous creature has not two Not three, Not five But sixteen colour receptor cones. So while we see a rainbow which stems out of three colours,The mantis sees a thermonuclear bomb of colours and beauty, which is why they are so gorgeous to look at.For a creature exuding such beauty, one would expect them to be some sort of an underwater holy man. This however, couldn't be farther from the truth. The mantis shrimp is actually an underwater nightmare and one of the most creatively violent creatures on this planet. It has two raptorial appendages on the front of its body. These accelerate with the same speed as a gunshot out of a 22 caliber rifle, and in less than 3/1000th of a second can snap at their prey with 1500 Newtons of force. To put this in perspective, if humans flapped their arms at 1/1000 the force, they could throw a baseball into the orbit. They move their arms so quickly, the water around them boils in a phenomenon called supercavitation. When the cavitation bubbles collapse, it releases undersea shockwaves, which kills their prey even if they miss their otherwise perfect target. Aquariums don't typically house a mantis, because they seem to slaughter every other creature in it, and break the glass. This is why the mantis shrimp is my new favourite animal, because in presence of such light and beauty, it embraces darkness. It extols death with the luminescence of a dying star. The mantis shrimp is the Harbinger of blood-soaked rainbows. It is bright It is dark. And it is most certainly beautiful.

Jet A-1 is widely available outside the U.S.A. The main specifications for Jet A-1 grade are the UK specification DEF STAN 91-91 (Jet A-1) Nato code F-35, (formerly DERD 2494), and the ASTM specification D1655 (Jet A-1). Jet A If you wish to buy Jet A, then please read the following product information. Jet A is a kerosine grade fuel, which is usually only available in the U.S.A. Jet A has the same flash point as Jet A-1 but a higher freeze point maximum (-40\u00b0C). Jet A is supplied against the ASTM D1655 (Jet A) specification. Jet B If you wish to buy Jet B, then please read the following product information. Jet B is a distillate covering the naphtha and kerosene fractions. Jet B can be used as an alternative to Jet A-1, nevertheless, because it is more difficult to handle (higher flammability), there is only significant demand in very cold climates where its better cold weather performance is important. ASTM has a specification for Jet B nevertheless, in Canada Jet B is supplied against the Canadian Specification CAN/CGSB 3.23 TS-1 If you wish to buy TS-1, then please read the following product information. TS-1 is the main jet fuel grade available in Russian and CIS states. TS-1 is a kerosene type fuel with slightly higher volatility (flash point is 28C minimum) and lower freeze point (<-50C) compared to Jet A-1. American Civil Jet Fuels The basic civil jet fuel specification used in the United States of America is ASTM Specification for Jet Turbine Fuels D 1655, which defines the requirements for three grades of fuel: Jet A, a kerosine type fuel having a maximum freeze point of -40 degrees C.Jet A-1, a kerosine type fuel, identical with Jet A but with a maximum freeze point of -47 degrees C.Jet B, a wide-cut type fuel.Jet A is used within the United States by domestic and international airlines. Today, Jet B is rarely available except in parts of northern Canada where its lower freeze point and higher volatility is an advantage for handling and cold starting. UK Jet Fuels Although developed basically as a military jet fuel, D. Eng RD 2494, issued by the Ministry of Defence, was adopted as the standard UK civil jet fuel. It is now renamed as DEF STAN 91-91 and defines the requirements for a kerosene type fuel (Jet A-1 grade) having a maximum freeze point of -47 degrees C. Jet A-1 according to the DEF STAN 91-91 specification is very similar to Jet A-1 defined by the ASTM D 1655 except for a small number of areas where DEF STAN 91-91 is more stringent.

Helicopters all vary in size and the number of engines they have. The bigger the helicopter, the larger its engine or engines and the more thirsty they become.How Much Does it Cost to Become a Pilot? | Pilot TeacherWhen I was researching how I was going to become a pilot it took me months and months to figure out all the details. The\u2026https://pilotteacher.com/cost-to-become-a-pilot-all-the-licenses-compared/One of the first questions I often get asked when I\u2019m flying is \u201cHow much fuel does your bird burn\u201c?My current machine is a Eurocopter/Airbus AS350 B2 which is a single-engine helicopter and is one of the most popular and versatile machines used across the globe.Source: Rick James [ https://pilotteacher.com/about-me/ ] This helicopter burns on average around:  * 180 Litres per hour * 47 US Gallons per hour * 315 Pounds per hour * 143 Kilograms per hour Helicopters burn the most amount of fuel when using the most power and this occurs at two places in the \u2018Power Required Curve\u2019. The first place is when the helicopter is hovering and full of people, lifting a heavy load off the ground with a longline or slings or hovering high in the mountains. This is at the Zero Airspeed point of the curve. The second place is when the helicopter is traveling at high speed and having to overcome the drag created by the fuselage (Parasite Drag) and the drag created by the higher pitch angle of each rotor blade as it moves through the air (Profile Drag).

Top 10 Civilian & Military Comparisons [ https://pilotteacher.com/how-fast-can-a-helicopter-fly-top-10-civilian-military-comparisons/ ] How Much Fuel Does a Helicopter Hold? Most helicopters are designed to hold enough fuel for between 1.5 \u2013 3 hours of flying and a 20 minute reserve. The more fuel the helicopter burns the larger the fuel tank is made to achieve this duration. Additional fuel tanks can be fitted to extend the flight time for ferry flights and Search & Rescue. Everything in aviation is all about compromise. A helicopter that can fly for long periods of time needs a lot of fuel, but that fuel takes up space and weight. Also, the aircraft designers try to keep the fuel as close to the main rotor mast as possible to stop the aircraft\u2019s center of gravity drastically changing as the fuel tank empties. Most helicopters will have a fuel tank that will last approximately 21/ 2 \u2013 3 hours of operational flying with a 20 min reserve. Which is good because after 2 hours I\u2019m ready to stretch my legs! Some of the larger helicopters that are used to fly to offshore oil & gas platforms can have additional fuel tanks fitted in them. The Sikorsky S92 and the Agusta A139 are prime examples of this. Sikorsky S92 with Additional Fuel Tanks \u2013 Source: Ronnie Robertson [ https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bristow_S92_G-GALC_IMG_0578_(19091176455).jpg ] As helicopters begin to fly further, the oil & gas platforms begin to spread further in greater numbers. The farthest rigs can only be serviced by boat or by refueling the helicopters at other platforms before continuing on. What Type of Fuel Does a Helicopter Burn? Helicopters use two types of fuel depending on the type of engines they have. Piston-powered helicopters use a gasoline-based fuel called AvGas 100LL which is blue in color. Turbine-powered helicopters use a kerosine-based fuel called JetA and this is clear in color. AvGas is a high-octane gasoline fuel with a higher refinement which provides for a cleaner, filtered fuel that is also used in most small planes.The most common AvGas used in aviation today is 100LL. This is 100 octane Low Lead and it is dyed Blue to ensure pilot has the right fuel before filling up their aircraft. Jet Fuel is the second type of fuel used in helicopters. This is the same fuel used in the large airliners you fly on to go on vacation. It is used in all aircraft that have a gas turbine engine. Most helicopters that can carry 5 passengers or more will have a gas turbine engine. For a piston engine to create enough power to lift a heavy helicopter it would be very large and weigh a lot. The gas turbine engine provides much more power for its weight. Jet fuel is a kerosene-based fuel that mainly comes in two types. Jet-A and Jet-A1. Jet-A1 is an improved fuel over Jet-A in that it can be used down to -47\u00b0C (-40\u00b0F) rather than -40\u00b0C (-53\u00b0F) of Jet-A. Another addition to Jet-A1 is that it contains an anti-static additive to help prevent electrical static build-up to make it safer. Jet fuel is clear and smells like diesel. When filling up a helicopter it is very easy to instantly tell what kind of fuel you have before putting it into your tank. Putting AvGas into a gas turbine helicopter or vice versa is a sure-fire way to make the aircraft engineer see red, especially if you have ran the engine with it before realizing your mistake! Gas turbines burn fuel at a much higher rate compared to piston engines so their fuel burn rate is much higher and thus the fuel cost to operate a turbine-powered helicopter is much higher.This is the main reason that small, piston-engined aircraft are popular for training and private ownership.

The largest helicopter in the world, the Mil Mi-26T has a fuel tank capacity of 3170 gallons/12,000 liters and costs around $13,315 to fill. Just like regular gas for your car, the price of both AvGas and Jet fuel fluctuates and can cost different prices in different places.

Portable helicopter refueling pumps deliver 15 gallons of fuel per minute. Airport fuel trucks deliver up to 50 gallons per minute. A helicopter requiring a full refuel of around 100 gallons can take between 2-7 minutes. A typical fuel stop for a helicopter is around 10-20 minutes. By the time the helicopter has landed, shutdown, got fuel to the helicopter, refueled, and then ready for liftoff can be around 10-20 minutes. This usually gives the passengers time to use the bathroom, stretch their legs or have a small break. Helicopters are thirsty machines, especially if it has gas turbine engine engines. Smaller helicopters using a piston-powered engine have a much slower fuel burn rate so the amount of fuel they carry is far less compared to their turbine counterparts, making them far quicker to fill up. In the helicopter world there are three main ways that pilots get fuel into their machine: 1. Portable Fuel Transfer Pump When working out in remote areas pilots need to refuel out of drums of fuel. These drums can be placed threre ahead of time by the helicopter company or via a fuel delivery merchant. The pilot carries onboard the helicopter a field fueling set comprising of an electric fuel pump fitted with hoses and filters. The pilot lands, rolls up a drum or drums to the helicopter, assembles the fueling gear, and pumps the fuel from the drum into the helicopter. Each 55 gallon fuel drum usually contains around 250 liters and these pumps run at around 15 gallons per minute, or 68 liters per minute. Depending on the size of the helicopters fuel tank and the amount of fuel the helicopter needs will dictate how long it takes to refuel, for example: GPI Pump at 15GPM/68LPM: Fuel Amount Time 22G / 100L 1m27sec 33G / 150L 2m12sec 44G / 200L 2m54sec 55G / 250L 3m40sec 88G / 400L 5m52sec 110G / 500L 7m20sec 165G / 750L 11m00sec 220G / 1000L 14m40sec On top of this, if the pilot requires more than 55gal/250l then they will require multiple drums. Usually, the most efficient way is to get one drum in place, inspected for water and sediment, and start pumping. While that drum is pumping then roll up more drums as required and get them opened and the fuel inspected so the pilot can easily move the fuel pump over to the next drum when the first is empty. Fuelling this way is by far the slowest but when this is the only option to get fuel in remote locations you have no choice. These fuel stops usually take around 20-40 minutes from landing to takeoff for most helicopters. If you would like to see how this exact fuel stop is conducted see my video HERE [ https://youtu.be/MG4Ox8nU9HA ]: 2. Stationary/Temporary Fuel Bowser When flying into a small or unmanned airport, or dedicated helicopter staging area they may contain a self-serve fuel bowser and fuel pump, very similar to how you refuel your vehicle. There is usually a bowser for Avgas which is used to fuel piston-engines aircraft and a Jet A bowser, used for fueling aircraft with gas turbine engines. A Dedicated Wildfire Helibase Fuel Bowser These fueling stations are usually located on the main apron and its a case of taxiing up close if your helicopter/airplane has wheels, or hovering and landing close in a helicopter with skids. Just like your car, the pilot will insert a credit card or input a code into a keypad and begin fue..."

I had moved here 2 years before and my parents were very poor, both in terms of pecuniary means and in terms of useful advice regarding applying to college. I had nothing but my intellect and was conceited enough to fancy myself an intellectual wunderkind. Naturally, my hero was Alexander Hamilton.

I had moved here 2 years before and my parents were very poor, both in terms of pecuniary means and in terms of useful advice regarding applying to college. I had nothing but my intellect and was conceited enough to fancy myself an intellectual wunderkind. Naturally, my hero was Alexander Hamilton. I found all the Hamilton biographies I could get my hands on and devoured them. Here was a kid who had so impressed people on his native island that they had put together some money to send him to study in the 13 colonies. And there, by sheer force of will, he had achieved greatness. I had no doubt that I, too, would be great. Hadn\u2019t I been calling myself Habib The Great for years? What better role model and hero could I have? On top of this, unlike his nemesis, the racist Jefferson who had written that blacks were \u201cinferior to the whites in the endowments of both body and mind, the version of Hamilton I read about in the various hagiographies written about him was an abolitionist and a believer in racial equality. Furthermore, his interpretation of the commerce clause as giving rise to a government that could do stuff it wasn\u2019t specifically forbidden from doing, as opposed to one that could only do things it was specifically allowed to do, was and remains to me entirely rational. What was there not to like?Of course, in time, I would come to understand the man within his historical context and to add nuance to the picture of perfection I had painted in my mind. Strangest of all, I would come to embrace many features of the Jeffersonian vision, even as I continued to loathe Jefferson the man himself. The next turning point in my life in terms of finding a hero was med school. Up to then, I had been a kid who could effortlessly learn any subject. Before then, in most classes, all I had to do was practice taking questions for 2 hours before an exam in order to be sure to ace it. Organic chemistry was the first class I remember having to study for. I needed to start studying a whole 2 days before the exam!!! Needless to say, I this approach to my studies meant that I had no discipline whatsoever. Ask anyone who has been through long and hard studies and they\u2019ll tell you: hard work and discipline are a lot more helpful than raw smarts. In retrospect, med school was always going to be very hard for me. When you have large quantities of material to absorb and memorize, intelligence is no substitute for rigor. Unfortunately for me, my fragile sense of self was very dependent on my continued ability to see myself as intelligent. More unfortunately still, I had come to define intelligence as academic success. So, when for the first time in my memory I could not do well academically, I fell into a deep depression. I came to believe that deep down, I had never really been intelligent. I had just been lucky that I hadn\u2019t studied anything truly difficulty. I had just been lucky that I hadn\u2019t been competing against really intelligent people. I did not belong in med school. I was unworthy of being there and I was unworthy of the high self-esteem in which I had held myself up to then. It is in this state of mind that I found my new hero. He had had a very lackluster life and seemed to be going nowhere in particular when the civil war started. He was given the opportunity to shine and through common sense and a dogged determination to keep trying and moving forward whatever the obstacles, whatever his previous failings, became the greatest military strategist the war produced on either side. He is still my hero to this day.Ulysses S. Grant at Cold Harbor.",
            "Let\u2019s go with two heroes for each distinct epoch of my life, because I\u2019ve had quite a few heroes. Newborn to 6 Years Old: Batman: First and mightiest. I must have seen a thousand hours of Batman: The Animated Series, and Kevin Conroy will always be the true Batman to me. I adored his theatricality, his cleverness and logic in defeating villains, his compassion when dealing with sympathetic villains like Freeze or Harley Quinn.

Newborn to 6 Years Old: Batman: First and mightiest. I must have seen a thousand hours of Batman: The Animated Series, and Kevin Conroy will always be the true Batman to me. I adored his theatricality, his cleverness and logic in defeating villains, his compassion when dealing with sympathetic villains like Freeze or Harley Quinn. Now that I\u2019m older, I also appreciate that Bruce Wayne spends his time on philanthropy and running Wayne Enterprises as a kooky but competent businessman rather than an airheaded, arrogant playboy, as much as I loved The Dark Knight trilogy. There was something pure in his heroism and in the writing of the show. I spent just as many hours demanding that family members take command of the Batman action figure so I could pit orcs and Emperor Palpatine and the Joker and the family dog against him. I didn\u2019t think I was capable of the swift thinking and action that Batman\u2019s plastic avatar needed, and I was right, as I was pretty slow as a kidlet. Luke Skywalker: A walking stereotype of the Heroes\u2019 Journey, I honestly thought Luke was an annoying ass throughout A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. But Luke in The Return of the Jedi? There was a clarity of purpose to him that the other characters lacked. Again, we get down to there being something pure. Luke in A New Hope is a teenager just itching to go on an adventure. The Empire Strikes Back sees him as a mess of conflicted priorities between his Jedi training and his friends, torn apart by Vader\u2019s revelation and Obi-Wan\u2019s seeming betrayal. Now that I\u2019m, er, probably about Luke\u2019s age when he first shows up, I actually love and appreciate all iterations of Luke, from snot-nosed teenager to Jedi Knight to happily married Grandmaster of the New Jedi Order. Luke is brave and compassionate, and the rescue operation in Jabba\u2019s Palace and near the Sarlaac\u2019s Pit is fantastic. But what absolutely entranced wee Joseph was everything that transpired in the Emperor\u2019s Throne Room. Utter dignity and a refusal to break his principles. I was astonished that the final fight was won by throwing away his lightsaber (and his dad throwing an elderly man to his death, I suppose) rather than a climactic duel. 7 Years Old to 12 Years Old It was around this time we undertook a horribly long drive somewhere. (It was probably thirty minutes long.) Just in case I got bored of making my Skywalker and Batman dolls swing dance, my dad handed me a book to read during the drive. I almost left behind the action figures, and I\u2019m still not entirely sure what happened the few days after that because my nose was buried in that damn book. Charlemagne: It was a book about Charlemagne, the Father of Europe and Grandfather of Christopher Lee and pretty much everyone Genghis Khan doesn\u2019t claim. In retrospect, it should have been fairly obvious why the life of Charlemagne would get me fired up. It involved a man that loved reading and learning and history so much he kicked off the Carolingian Renaissance by sponsoring the nerds in the Church, and a man that kicked copious amounts of Saxon pagan ass. I had no idea what Saxons or pagans were, but I had a feeling I wouldn\u2019t get along with them. Charlemagne was the gateway drug to other historical figures, like Napoleon, since they were all also big fans of his. Nowadays my opinion on Charlemagne is that he\u2019s a crucial figure to study to understand his times, and that he was impressive. I have, however, grown quite fond of both Saxons and pagans, as anyone looking at my Crusader Kings or Total War savegames can attest. At this age I had an unhealthy fascination with war and nationalism and stirring anthem music. Again, it felt pure, it kicked off an emotional high in me and made me feel part of something greater, something that school and social groups didn\u2019t offer. Napoleon was another hero, but even as a kid I admitted that he was a bit of a prick, but I couldn\u2019t help but like him. Alexander: I had to write up a report on a historical person for my third grade class. I naturally typed in, \u201cNOT AMERICAN famous generals,\u201d and finally stumbled across a short story about Alexander taming Bucephalus. I became an ardent admirer, reading every story I could get my hands on and swallowing every legend down and demanding more. I edited files in Rome: Total War to be able to play as Macedon in his name and fancied myself a hacker. Again, I loved the theatrics of it. I adored him for his ridiculous feathered helmet, his ego the size of Mount Olympus, his gallant chase of Darius and brutal execution of Bessus for Darius\u2019s murder. Alexander of Macedon was my first celebrity crush, to be honest. I was irritatingly insistent that the losses at the Hydaspes weren\u2019t Alexander\u2019s fault, and only privately admitted how cool I thought Porus was to have nearly beaten him in a straight fight. I tried to see his god-complex, alcoholism, and glory-hounding as tragic flaws rather than as something that would make me despise the man in person. Today, Alexander is a supernova. Gorgeous and fascinating to study. From a distance. 12 Years Old to 16 Years: My political views and values, and to an extent my religious ones, were upturned in the seventh grade. While middle school was miserable for a host of reasons, what shook me to my core was a single news article I read that year, in the closing months of the Bush Administration. All of my gleeful patriotism and hero-worshipping of generals wilted when I read the reports on the torture going on at Guantanamo Bay, the utter perversion of what I saw as America\u2019s values. I started to study what was actually going on in the Middle East, what the United States had been doing for decades, what states actually did just as a course of business. While I was still fascinated by war and battle and government, it wasn\u2019t pure. It was the filthiest mess I\u2019d ever come across. It was during this period that I leaned heavily into fantasy and literature for relief, and even started writing myself. The dopey Morrowind, but with a Cheers set-up is probably the best thing I wrote in the early part of this period, which should tell you just how terrible the rest was. Terry Pratchett: Right around the same time I was disillusioned with, well, everything, along came an author who turned language into something as much science as art, and made me cry with laughter at the same time. I read as many Discworld books as I could find in the school library. Those of you who have read Night Watch will probably understand why Samuel Vimes became an idol to me. I still struggle to read Pratchett books after his death, even though I have many left to go. Gaiman\u2019s comments after his death, that Pratchett was not a lovable gnome, but a very angry man, a man that fumed because he was intelligent and moral and couldn\u2019t help but see all that troubled people. Rather than screaming at people, he made brilliant jokes and heartrending scenes, and I\u2019ll always be grateful for that. Neil Gaiman: Neil Gaiman is every bit as flashy with his writing as Alexander was with his tactics, but he\u2019s British enough to make it look humble. American Gods humbled me, with the book very nearly being perfection in my eyes. Gaiman continues to write as a sort of master artisan of language, combining genres in ways I never thought of, always finding the perfect word. 17 Years Old: It was at this point that I came to a stop on my religious identification cruise ship. I\u2019d originally identified as Protestant Christian. In retrospect, the only time I ever actually spoke or thought about Jesus when I was a Christian was asking God to tell him happy birthday on Christmas. My religious beliefs were closest to a strange blend of Judaism and Islam, though I have no idea how that happened as I was only exposed to those theologies years later. I slowly drifted through religions, happily identifying as a heretic and apostate, and just grabbed bits I liked from Buddhism, Hinduism, Greeco-Roman mythology, and even some fantasy religions because why not. To my embarrassment, my Junior Year of High School was my Angry Atheist year. I tried to keep it aimed at genuinely horrible people, but I\u2019m fairly certain I made an ass out of myself more than once. I e Christopher Hitchens: A polemic, albeit a very witty one. I have complicated feelings on Hitchens nowadays, and disagree with him massively on many issues. But I respect his ability to express those opinions, and was always fascinated to see him unleashed in a debate arena. I\u2019m honestly not sure how to sort out my view of him. There are times when he expressed views that I consider quite ghastly to have, and times when he beautifully expressed worries and criticisms that had been wordlessly nagging at me for ages. He became a hero of mine when I first saw the video of him voluntarily undergoing waterboarding so that he could be a journalist that offered a researched opinion on whether it was torture. (He came conclusively down on the side that it was.) I somewhat sheepishly admitted to a coach in my high school year that my ambition was to become the next Christopher Hitchens, but I really didn\u2019t want to visit North Korea or smoke and glower at cameramen like some godless heathen from the depths of noir film. Richard Dawkins: Another of the Four Horsemen of the Atheist Apocalypse. While Hitchens was more attuned to the polemic side of debate, Dawkins focused on the science. I did my best to emulate the Scientific Method. Judging by my grade in Biology, I did poorly. I became obsessed with arguing over the theory of evolution with New Earth Creationists at my school, and started bringing science and zoology into arguments over LGBT rights, pointing out how homosexuality is literally older than humanity. While I appreciate Dawkins for this, he\u2019s since lost a lot of favor with me for his questionable comments on women and letting his view on religion turn into attacking religious people simply for being religious, rather than abusing other people using their religion as a shield. 18 to 19 Years Old: Malala Yousafzai: When I first heard of a woman getting shot by the Taliban for trying to get more girls to get an education, I was horrified and quickly bypassed the story because I was already sad enough about the state of the world. Years later, I came across the story of a heroic and well-spoken teenager that campaigned for education reform for women in Pakistan. I was cheering her on through the article when at the very end it explained the Taliban\u2019s assassination attempt. The article was old, and didn\u2019t describe whether she lived or died. I decided to watch an episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart later that week, when who should show up but Malala Yousafzai herself? I\u2019ve seen her in several interviews, and she never fails to put me at least a little bit in awe. Bernie Sanders: While I liked both Democratic candidates, I\u2019d grown up in one of those households that spat whenever someone dared to utter the name \u2018Clinton\u2019. For whatever reason, the hatred was stronger against Hillary than it was Bill, despite it supposedly being Bill\u2019s time as President that sealed the hatred. While I ultimately concluded that Sanders was the worse candidate, and that he wasn\u2019t an outsider, I admired his attempt to shake up the system, and still didn\u2019t know too much about Hillary Clinton at that point. I hoped that Sanders\u2019 grassroots movement would galvanize Clinton into realizing she could get away with a much more liberal platform than anyone thought. Sanders and I got our wish. Well. To a point. 20 Years Old: I haven\u2019t wrapped this one up yet, but I can name-drop Hillary Clinton, Angela Merkel, the Obamas, Patrick Rothfuss, Chris Avellone, Sarah Parcak, Jon Stewart, Bernard Cornwell, JK Rowling, and a few Quorans as contenders.

I love this question! \"How have your personal heroes changed over time?\" Well, they have changed as I have changed, really. What I hope and aspire for evolves, and thus the people I admire or call \"heroes\" do as well. As a young, scared child, my heroes were the police, soldiers, and firefighters. They were so brave and they helped others and they were looked upon as heroes. (My uncle was a very senior firefighter in New Westminster, so that also helped.) I was fearful so I admired the fearless. As a young teenager, I became a bit more aware of the state of the world. It seemed so complicated and at the time I lived in a very black-and-white world, where I viewed everything was good or bad, right or wrong. I wanted a simple answer for the world's issues, so (and it pains me to say this) my next hero was Ronald Reagan. (Remember, people, I was like 14-15 at the time.) I wanted easy answers, so I admired the man who had them. They turned out to be na\u00efve, dangerous, and often ridiculous answers, but dammit they were easy! After Iran-Contra and more then ten dozen indictments against Reagan's staff, I was in need of a new hero. I turned to music. My two new heroes were musicians. I'll take them one at a time. With Reagan and the easy answers now discredited in my mind, I was looking for someone to fix things. Enter Bob Geldof, whom I liked as the lead singer of the punk-ish band \"The Boomtown Rats\" (\"I Don't Like Mondays\", \"Rat Trap\") who organized a charity record to alleviate starvation in Ethiopia. As the driving force behind \"Band Aid\", my admiration of his skyrocketed. Someone who could fix the world's problems! (I never said I wasn't still na\u00efve at that age.) Band-Aid led to \"Live Aid\" (and later Live-8) and spawned a whole series of artists making charity records to help. (Remember \"USA for Africa\"? They released a single. In Canada we had the single \"Tears Are Not Enough\".) The other musician hero I had was Roger Waters of Pink Floyd. As an angst-filled introverted teenager, I could really relate to the themes behind \"The Wall\" and his other scathing attacks on society. To skip over the next few decades, let me summarize. In the time when I felt like the challenges were too great for me to overcome, another hero was Franklin Delano Roosevelt; a man who was paralyzed due to polio, yet achieved the presidency of the United States and was elected four times. In the same vein, I looked at punk singer Joey Ramone as an inspiration. As a kid, he was a bullied, myopic, kid with OCD and a learning disability named Jeff Hyndman. No matter how many times he was knocked down in life, he just rolled with it, and I needed that inspiration. He still made something of his life. While battling the cancer that would end his life, he released a solo album which became his final message to the world. The album was titled \"Don't Worry About Me\" and the single that drove the album was a cover of the song \"What a Wonderful World.\" Most recently, as the world becomes a more volatile place, my heroes are those people who can either A) rise above it, or B) put it into perspective. In the former category, there is no greater example than Malala, the young lady who (as a child) was shot by the Taliban for the heinous crime of thinking that women should have the right to an education. That she survived is the whole world's gain. She was not bitter or hateful, she showed a strength of character and grace that people many times older than her could only dream of achieving in their lives. In the latter category, I would name the likes of Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, and Bill Maher. To a lesser extent, Stephen Colbert. They have a way of making a scary, frustrating, and seemingly dysfunctional world and boil it down into its base elements. My biggest heroes, however, have always been my family. My parents set a terrific example of ethics and decency which I have always aspired to emulate. My children remind me daily of what sort of person I need to be to help them shape their own lives. I learn as much from them as they learn from me. You know what else is funny? I am still very much appreciative and admiring of those firefighters, soldiers, and police whose sole job is the protection of others in Canada. Some heroes don't seem to diminish.",

Not only that, but he was the youngest North Korean fighter pilot of the Korean War. His day job therefore consisted of flying these:This is a MiG (Mikoyan-Gurevich)-15. It was developed using research on swept wings taken from the Germans, and powered by a reverse engineered British Rolls-Royce Nene engine which the British Minister of Trade, Sir Stafford Cripps, had for some inexplicable reason sold to the Soviets under the agreement that they would not put it in a jet fighter. When the Korean War broke out with North Korea\u2019s surprise attack on South Korea, the North Korean air force consisted of World War Two vintage propellor driven fighter aircraft, which were both outnumbered and outclassed by the American straight winged jets (Such as the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star) facing them. The result was American air superiority, and free rein for American B-29s to bomb North Korea. Then suddenly, the MiG-15 appeared in the skies over Korea, and proceeded to utterly outclass the American fighters in turn. This handed control of the air back to the North, and suddenly the B-29s were not having such an easy time of it. Indeed, the Americans were so desperate to get their mitts on one that they offered a reward of $100,000 and political asylum to any pilot who would defect with one. Meanwhile they rushed their own swept wing jet fighter, the F-86 Sabre, to Korea to counter it. Meanwhile, No was progressing through pilot training, first in the Navy and then in a Manchurian flight training programme, but he had a secret that would have landed him in deep trouble had it been revealed; He was not a communist at all. In fact he was quite anti-communist and pro-American, views dating back to his childhood in Japanese-occupied Korea. Indeed on one occasion, when he and his aircraft were being inspected by Kim Il Sung himself, he seriously thought about just pulling out his pistol and shooting the \u201cGreat Leader\u201d right there and then, but he decided against it. No ended up flying his MiG on many combat missions during the Korean War, but he always held off from actually engaging in air to air combat, partly to avoid getting himself killed and partly so he wouldn\u2019t end up killing any American pilots. No had had dreams to go and live in the United States for a while by this point, but he hid it by essentially appearing to be the most devoted Communist in the entirety of the Second World. He started his own newspaper (Ardently pro-communist) and generally appeared to be every bit the loyal Communist. Secretly, however, he was plotting his escape. In July 1953, after the Korean War finally settled into stalemate around the 38th Parallel, an armistice was signed that ended the war, and established the DMZ around the area of the front at the time. On the 21st of September 1953, a few months after the end of the war, No Kum Sok was taking off on a routine flight from his airbase, or so everyone thought. In fact, what he was actually doing was stealing his MiG and defecting. He turned south, and flew across the 38th Parallel. The North Koreans did not attempt to stop him, mostly because he had taken them by surprise and any aircraft they did send to stop him would not have caught him in time, and the Americans did not shoot him down (they did not know of his intentions any more than the North Koreans did) because their radar had been shut off for routine maintanance, which was a stroke of frankly incredible luck for the defector. Eventually, after 17 minutes of flight, No began to approach an American airbase, the Kimpo airbase which is now the Gimpo international airport. Because he did not really have time to plan his approach properly, No was forced to land facing the wrong way down the runway, forcing another aircraft who was also landing to swerve out of his way at the surprise MiG coming straight at his face. No landed successfully and immediately jumped out of his plane. He tore up the picture of Kim that he and all North Korean pilots kept in their cockpits before surrendering.No Kum Sok in full pilot\u2019s uniform, immediately after landing his MiG-15 at Kimpo He was eventually awarded the $100,000 reward for his MiG, despite his insistence that he had never even heard such a reward was available and that it was not his motivation for defecting. He eventually realized his ambition of moving to the United States, and he still lives in Florida today.

Captain Zuyev was a MiG-29 Fulcrum pilot and was married to the daughter of the Chief of Staff of the Soviet Air Division. He applied for training to become a test pilot, and despite his excellent record, his request was denied. It was shortly after this that a bitter Zuyev began having marital troubles and deeply questioned the virtues of the Soviet system. It turns out that Zuyev had a friend that was a long time radar technician. This friend told him the truth about what happened to Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which the Soviets shot down in 1983, killing all 269 people aboard, including US Congressman Larry McDonald. Arctic gales had knocked out radar systems on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and local officials had lied to Moscow, saying that it had been fixed. \"Some people lied to Moscow, trying to save their ass,\" Zuyev would later say of the incident. He also learned that the public evacuation of children from the towns affected by the Chernobyl reactor meltdown was delayed for two weeks, while prominent Communist Party members and their families were rushed out of the area within 48 hours. \"How would you feel?\" he later said. \"Would you feel like this is a fair system? Would you feel like you would be happy to defend this system?\" For these reasons and others, he decided to defect to the United States. At the time, he was stationed with the Baku PVO regiment at Gudauta, along the northeast coast of the Black Sea. Zuyev's plan to defect was unique, to say the least. The night before he planned to leave, the Soviet fighter pilot baked a large strawberry cake and put a number of sleeping pills in the batter. He told his fellow pilots and ground crew that his wife was pregnant and invited them to celebrate the joyous occasion. During the party, Zuyev personally handed slices of cake to 18 of his fellow pilots. He waited for the pills to take effect, cut the phone lines, and then made his way to a hangar where the MiG-29s were stored.** The escape vehicle Zuyev had drugged his comrades so severely that later they all had to be hospitalized. At the hanger, Zuyev ran into an armed guard and told him he was there to relieve him because his replacement would be late. The guard left but quickly returned and confronted the MiG pilot. A scuffle ensued where Zuyev was shot in the arm, and the guard was shot and wounded. Leaving a small trail of blood, he made his way to the jet and attempted to start it, but nothing happened. It was then that he thought he would be shot again for trying to desert. He would later say about the incident, \"This is it, this is really the end of my life.\" But it wasn't. The aircraft started on the second attempt, and he managed t...",

At 1:10 p.m, Japanese radars picked up a plane. Where had it come from? Ten minutes later, two jets of the Japanese air force were scrambled. Belenko was soon in a dilemna. Where should he land? He was low on fuel. At Hakodate Airport, it was a normal day. Suddenly, a fighter jet came in to land, but it was not one they had seen before. It also had a red star. Almost hitting a passenger plane, it landed, deploying a parachute in an attempt to stop. It ran off the runway, and finally slowed to a halt next to an antenna. People and airport workers began to gather and take pictures, but the man in the plane fired a pistol. One hour after the mystery plane had been detected, it had arrived at a tiny airport. The police arrived and closed the airport, and took the man into custody. While in custody, the man gave his name: Viktor Belenko. Then, he requested asylum in the U.S., which was granted two days later. For two weeks, soldiers, ships, and jets guarded the Soviet plane, under fear Russian agents would attempt to get the plane back or prevent it from falling under U.S. control. On September 25, the Mig was given to the U.S. Soviet pressure kept the plane in Japan on the ground, but not from American technicians from taking it apart and inspecting it. One and a half months later, it returned to Soviet hands. The Americans, much to their surprise, had learned the Mig-25 was not an air combat fighter, and only effective against bombers.

            "Several Russian political analysts suggested that between Putin's meeting with Xi Ping on September 15 and the announcement of \"partial\" mobilization on September 21, several high-ranking \"siloviki\" floated to Putin the idea of a \"partial\" retirement.

It went as follows: Putin's leadership complicated any international negotiations, not only with the western countries but with India and China. Meanwhile, the Russian army is in disarray after the Ukrainian lightning offensive in Kharkiv - it either needs a respite or way more bodies. If someone else - possibly a temporary governing committee - becomes Russia's face for some time, it would go a long way to ease international tensions and perhaps even negotiate a peace treaty with Ukraine. The solution, therefore, was for Putin to step down - temporarily - due to health issues, sit out the storm and come back when things normalized somewhat. There's a precedent in the Governmental Committee for Extreme Situations that briefly replaced Gorbachev (though unwillingly) in 1991, and Putin played a similar \"tandemocracy\" game with Medvedev. Unlike in 1991, the proponents of this maneuver did not intend - or were too afraid - to stage a coup, so they openly discussed the \"swapping\" with Putin. It appears that Putin entertained this solution but backed down at the last minute, fearing that his stepping down would become permanent and irreversible (which, honestly, it probably would). Instead, he quickly ramped the stakes by proclaiming mobilization and annexing Ukrainian territories. Again, the supposed plan to swap Putin is just a theory, but the hastily arranged mobilization (even the proclamation itself aired with an uncanny 12+ hours delay, to say nothing about the lack of preparation and logistics) lends some credibility to it. There's little doubt that by the end of September Kremlin faced a critical situation of a collapsing front, and it had two options: escalate the conflict or cut the losses. As we know, Putin opted to escalate: now, RF openly targets civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, thus cementing its reputation as a pariah state and a war criminal; and - even more importantly - it has declared mobilization, which Russia has resorted to only in WW1 and WW2, with one of those resulting in the execution of the tzar (and both in the death of millions of Russian subjects). Contrary to the world wars, The Russo-Ukrainian war is not an invasion of Russian territory. It is not, by any measure, a fight for the survival of the Russian nation. It is 100% a Putin adventure. If it were to end, the only consequence for the Russian people would be that they go home - and most would be grateful to do so instead of digging trenches and being battered by Ukrainian artillery. In fact, by issuing mobilization, Putin gave whatever provisional government that would replace him a \"get out of jail card\" - the only thing they'd need to do to get the initial popular support in Russia is to call off the mobilization and put an end to the war. The closest analogy to this is the 1956 Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that followed Stalin's death. The Congress recognized the \"mistakes\" of Stalin's rule and set a correction course in both internal and international policies, thus preventing turmoil. And that's likely will be the script in case of Putin's sudden demise: a committee government that pulls the troops out of Ukraine as their first order of business.",

The leadership would disperse to undisclosed locations, in case there were a coup or an attack. Doctors would work around the clock to (a) attempt resuscitation, (b) figure out what triggered the heart attack, and (c) look for anything suspicious. There would be no surprises here. Passport control at the airports would be tightened for high officials. Special police and guards would be deployed at strategic locations, and armed police would patrol large cities. NATO would also go on high alert, to match the posture of the Russian military. NATO and Japanese Aegis destroyers would fan out through the Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic Oceans within 4-6 days, for a month or two. US, British and French nuclear submarines would be deployed in the Arctic and Pacific oceans for three months, possibly longer. In the meantime, the West will try to find out who controls Russian nuclear launch codes and for how long. No announcement would be made in Russia for about 24 hours, until stock markets in Europe dropped by 2% (and by 5% in Russia). Markets would drift lower for a few days, but reverse half the losses when nothing outrageous happened in Moscow and everything was explained in state media. Oil prices would go up on the uncertainty and stay high for longer. During a short period of mourning, mainstream Russian media would act a little lost. There would be a lot of classical music on Russian TV channels, including the Swan Lake. After the surprisingly modest burial, one would see an unusual amount of statistics, used to substantiate both positive and not-so-positive opinions about Putin's reign. Towns and landmarks would be renamed after Putin, or at least some officials would try that. Within a week, the media would raise the \"What now?\" issue. In the meantime, a predetermined temporary replacement, most likely Dmitry Medvedev, would formally take Putin's place and continue essentially the same policies for about a year. Behind the scenes, several groups of power-players -- (1) the political elite, (2) the military, (3) the state security and interior ministry, as well as (4) professional economists and the business elite, - would duke it out for influence. There would be no fireworks for a while. Russia is up for parliamentary elections in 2016 and presidential elections in 2018. So, whoever ended up running the show would be legitimized through elections, and their opponents would be handicapped. Some candidates might not be allowed to run. Some would  be investigated for corruption or other crimes. Others would be praised by the state media as trustworthy politicians, capable administrators, experienced managers, and true patriots. My money is on the state security camp making a deal with the business elite, and also making promises to the military not to break glass for some time. In this case, the elections optics will be \"new and improved\", and the West will praise the elections (but really, just the optics :) A number of figurehead politicians will lose their jobs, and it will look like a big change, but many of the movers and shakers will remain. What happens next is going to be very interesting, but is really beyond the scope of the question. P.S. The likelihood of Putin dying of natural or unnatural causes before 2018 is small. For one, his demise would not solve any serious questions, and might only complicate them. It would also create uncertainty and geopolitical risk. IMHO, Putin has already made key decisions that only he could make. He appears to be in reasonable health (despite various rumors) and, in any case, has access to superb medical care. He is not sanctioned by the West, so could receive treatment abroad if necessary. Update: if the MH 17 investigation convincingly implicates Putin, this could make him toxic even to his own people. Still a long shot, but I revised \"tiny\" to \"small\" in the first sentence of this paragraph. P.P.S. This question brought some memories from 1982, when Leonid Brezhnev died, and several Soviet leaders followed him quickly, until Mikhail Gorbachev was assigned the leader of the USSR in 1985. Incidentally, the USSR shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983, killing all passengers, and did not accept responsibility. Yeltsin accepted it ten years later on behalf of the Russian Federation. Russian TV has a saying for such cases, \"Coincidence? - I think not!\" (I am being facetious). Update: there is a more conspiratorial scenario, where Putin is replaced by one of his body doubles for some time, while a shadowy committee runs the country. This would look as if nothing happened until the replacement holds negotiations with foreign leaders. For one, foreign leaders have the right to know whether they are dealing with the real Putin because any negotiations held with a replacement and any treaties signed by him would be null and void.",

And it\u2019s hurricane season. According to the revered and prestigious laws of the Russian lands (nowadays replaced by an handwritten addendum stuffed into the law book stating 'I do as I damn well please\u2019, signed V. V. Putin, the succession is clear and the ultimate power of the Russian federation goes to this illustrious person:I\u2019m running the show now\u2026 (oh dear) Who\u2019s he? Well let me introduce you to Mikhail Vladimirovich Mishustin, Prime Minister of Russia. Formerly the head of the board of the International Computer Club of Russia, formerly the head of the Federal Tax Service of Russia and since January 15, 2020, Prime Minister of Russia. It\u2019s not his good looks, charm, abilities or wit that put him in that position, I do assure you. Oh no, he\u2019s the number 2 in Russia for precisely one thing. He has the personality of wet cardboard, the powerful alliances of absolutely diddly squat and is at most a threat to the cockroaches outside of his corridor in Kremlin. The perfect wingman with other words for Mr. Putin since Mr. Mishustin\u2019s threat level against his employer is color coded as Cream Latte. This poor sod is now suddenly thrown out deep into the stinking midden of Russian Byzantine political power struggles. How fun indeed his days to come. He'll have the life expectancy of a wafer thin mint chocolate in a blast furnace. The whole corrupt house of cards regarding the power structure of Russia has just met the proverbial outhouse hurricane and it will soil anyone close to the throne with it full stinky mess. So he will live in interesting times, however brief. What will come upon the agenda? The Army The army will have neither bearing nor goals to accomplish anything suddenly and no-one will know what the will is or will be of the current (or coming) cushion warmer on the throne in Kremlin. As long as it\u2019s Mr. Mishustin, he\u2019ll probably be more pressed by, and acutely in need, of a new pair of pants. Without the illustrious leadership of Mss. Putin's Boy Blunder the general staff of the armed forces of Russia will be at a loss regarding what orders to give? Who will they be loyal to? Who\u2019s fingers have they stepped upon and who\u2019s hands have they been stabbing on their way up? What will the new leader say about it? Or will they only show their scarred hand before the are dragged away to the closest open window? What will happens with their ill gotten gains and European villas and appartment\u2019s? Many will probably long for the silicon stuffed embrace of one of their many mistresses awaiting them in Europe who\u2019s making sure their ill gotten gains are always diminishing. The ground will be heated under many a commanders feet. Coals will be raked and bellows will be busy. Especially since it probably will be open window season in Kremlin. For many suffering in the trenches this will be a make or break situation. For many Putin has been the bogey man driving people into fatigues and forwards towards the enemy. If nothing else for the sheer terror he would unleash on you and your family should you not appreciative his military genius. Who's mere presence drives you into the hail of bullets and artillery from the Ukrainians. Why fight for someone that's no longer a threat to you or your loved ones? Morale among the troops, already fickle, will stagger, fall and probably never raise again, clutching the vodka bottle, while having a quiet tear in the corner. The Nobility The Siloviki, the Dukes of Russia, and the oligarchs, the lesser nobles, will be eyeing each other carefully. Mr Putin has been very, very careful in making sure that not one of them has had enough power to challenge him while leading them into the dance of power in the corridors of Kremlin. But that leaves Russia without an successor who cannot be challenged. So everyone will challenge each other in the race to acquire as much power as possible. Have you seen the movie \u201cThe Death of Stalin\u201d? That was a comedy, this will be a tragedy. The People Without the dear leader the people, already burden, will be despondent to say the least. For decades the dear leader has groomed them in his propaganda basement as the proverbial kidnapper, to make them like him above no other, to endure his fondling of their privacy and look upon him cultwise almost as Christ risen. Now without their cult leader, they\u2019ll have a hard time and their attention and affection will be flapping in the wind, ready to hook on who ever will come next, as long as they promise the same sense of imaginary security, even if they once again will be lead down the basement to learn to love the new leader.

I'm not so sure if it's still disabled).Also they get more information out of GPS signals as discussed later in this answer. If the satellites are 'broadcast only ' and they are transmitting \"blindly\" to the Earth, how can the US military disable it for certain areas? There are primarily two codes that are transmitted from satellites (yes, yes I know this is changing). These codes are the C/A code and the P code. C/A is civilian access and P is military. The main difference between the two is that P offers a higher degree of accuracy (obviously) through a much longer and more complicated algorithm. The main way that you can stop GPS from being used is to jam the frequencies. This is done by broadcasting a loud signal over the C/A code frequency from the ground. Sort of like how you can't hear a conversation at a concert - the noise around you is just too loud. However, the P code is at a different frequency, so jamming at the C/A frequency won't affect the military GPS. Keep in mind that GPS signals are buried in the noise floor (very, very, very weak). You don't need a strong jammer to block the signal. The P code is encrypted such that you have to have a very complicated algorithm to decode it. Note that if you were to try and build your own GPS jammer, you would probably be arrested. It's illegal. It's also not very hard to track down the signal much as it's not very hard to find the screaming kid in a daycare at naptime. Is it possible to disable GPS for an entire country?  Or can the signals be jammed for small areas only? One can only jam small areas. But think about cell phone towers. They provide cell signal to huge ranges of people. Now imagine if that was a GPS jammer. For an operation as big as the US military, it wouldn't be too hard to set up a few of those and boom. An entire country is jammed. Throw it on a predator drone and now you have an unmanned mobile jammer. What stops the \"enemies\" to jam P code frequency? Is it the encryption? Nothing really stops enemies from jamming the P code. However, there are signal techniques in place to make it harder to jam than the C/A code. But when you think about it, guerilla fighters (such as in the war that the US was fighting in Iraq) wouldn't want to broadcast such a loud signal. The US can pretty much take out anything, anywhere against such a small guerilla force. And a P-code GPS jammer would be so easy to find that it would be destroyed fairly quickly. Think of it like how I said above. There's a daycare at naptime, everyone is quiet. Then, all of a sudden, one kid starts screaming. While it's a little harder in reality than in this example, the principle remains the same. It's really, really easy to find the source of a loud signal at a certain frequency.",

It\u2019s the same basis on which it provides roads, police forces, farm subsidies, not to mention all the industries which depend on the defence industry. It all helps economic growth, which helps everyone in society. Left to the free market, we would have no satellites, let alone free ones.

The event that prompted the US Government to make sure that the C/A code was universally available was the shooting down of the Korean Airlines flight KAL007, when it inadvertently strayed into Soviet airspace on 1st September, 1983. The fact that the airliner was working with limited navigational capabilities on the long haul from Anchorage to Seoul meant that it had wandered well off course.

I\u2019m white British and if I could get OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) I would. I\u2019d be back out there in a heartbeat. I lived in India for three years and visited many times. I speak Hindi relatively well and have a working knowledge of Tamil. Why do I want to live in India? I lived in a little town called Ooty up in the Nilgiris Hills of Tamil Nadu. It\u2019s a rather beautiful place surrounded by rainforest. The town is served by a railway, part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Mountain Railways of India, that snakes its way up the hills providing views like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Ooty is pretty clean - cleaner than London at least. (For the record, I don\u2019t particularly enjoy living in cities anywhere - Mumbai is great for a visit, but I wouldn\u2019t want to live there!) Most single-use plastics are banned there, and they\u2019re getting stricter every year. For someone who loves the natural world, Ooty is spectacular. At the weekends I would just hop on my motorbike and ride around the mountains through the tea and eucalyptus plantations. If I fancied it, I could ride down the mountain through all the hairpin bends (great fun!) and head into the national parks and see elephants, bears, peacocks, monkeys and, if I was lucky, the big cats. If I fancied going even further I could quite easily pop into Kerala and go to one of the beach resorts. I could go from the cool drizzly Nilgiris Hills and be on a warm tropical beach in a few hours. Not many places you can do that!This is a photo of me (I\u2019ve got the green rucksack) and some visitors doing a trek in the mountains around Ooty. We\u2019re right at the edge of them - just behind us are the Mysore Plains and it\u2019s pretty much a straight 1000m drop from here to there! The variety of natural landscapes is a big attraction for me - you don\u2019t get that in Britain. I could even get to the Himalaya quickly and easily through a cheap domestic flight or an even cheaper (and fun) train journey! If I fancied going scuba diving one holiday I could go to Goa or the Andaman Islands. I\u2019m also fortunate in the sense that I earn a reasonably decent salary. By UK standards I don\u2019t, but by Indian standards I\u2019m rather wealthy. It meant that when I lived out there I could afford to have a maid - this is impossible for most British families, even relatively affluent ones. I had a nice house out there - comfortable and I never really had to worry about money. I basically did what I liked, ate out regularly (masala dosa for about Rs 50? Fantastic, and that was the inflated price I paid for being white!), went on holiday to exotic locations and had a nice motorbike. I worry about money constantly in the UK. The cost of education is frightening (gotta love all that student debt), my rent (small flat) is ridiculous, my bills go up every year (my salary doesn\u2019t), etc. etc. I haven\u2019t taken a proper holiday in YEARS.I made it to the top of Thorung La in Nepal on a trekking holiday doing the Annapurna Circuit - one of the best experiences of my life. Getting to Nepal is dead easy from India. The standard of living in India is higher - much higher - for middle-class families than in the UK, and that\u2019s nothing something you\u2019d necessarily realise unless you\u2019ve experienced both. I could do half as much work as I do now and still have more disposable income in India than I have in the UK. Contrary to popular belief, you can still get hold of just about everything you can get hold of in the West - even Marmite. I appreciate this is because there\u2019s a large portion of the country that doesn\u2019t have a lot of money. I love the people. India has just over a billion of them and they speak dozens of languages and practice several major religions (and many more minor ones). It is genuinely incredible that, for the most part, the country functions pretty well. My first few hours in India took me from Bangalore Airport to Ooty. On that journey I went through three states speaking three different languages with three different writing scripts (Karnataka, Kannada; Kerala, Malayalam; and Tamil Nadu, Tamil). I love that linguistic diversity. On the street I lived on were Christian families, Muslim families, Buddhist families (Tibetan refugees), Jains and Parsis. It is very rare even in the more cosmopolitan parts of the world to have that. While tensions do flare up from time to time, they are unusual. I once took my motorbike on an epic trip from Ooty to Goa and ended up breaking down just outside Mysore. I ended up pushing it to a mechanics (you can get anything fixed in India - no need to chuck stuff away) and we managed to have a conversation despite me not speaking a word of Kannada. The mechanic spoke a smattering of English, Tamil and Hindi, and so did I. We just switched between the three! [Photo deleted because someone reported this answer for being \u2018inappropriate\u2019, citing this photo. Not sure what was so inappropriate about it, but thank you anonymous internet police for making me a better person.] I was a geography teacher and here with one of my classes. There are six languages represented in this photo. I met some unpleasant people too, including some people who mugged me in New Delhi, but that\u2019s no different to anywhere else in the world. For the most part, Indians across the country are helpful, polite people. The food is incredible (and if you don\u2019t like Indian food you can have Chinese, pizza, fried chicken, whatever - it\u2019s all there), there are amazing landmarks (the Taj Mahal really is worth seeing) and it\u2019s an extraordinarily exciting place with a lot going on and rapidly evolving. I could go on and on. India is my second home and I\u2019d very much like to go back! Samuel LickissWriter and broadcasterwww.samuellickiss.com Edit: This answer has, extremely quickly, become my most upvoted and commented-on answer on Quora\u2026by a very long way, as shown by my 30-day stats:So, wow, and thanks! I normally hang around in the science/linguistics/geography section of Quora and get a few dozen upvotes for answers I spend several hours researching and writing. This answer took me a little bit of my lunch break and required no research at all beyond a quick scroll through Facebook to find some photos. Quora\u2019s funny like that. I have responded properly to most comments individually and in detail so far, but quite a lot are getting added every day and I have a feeling I\u2019m going to find it prohibitively time consuming to do so. I\u2019ll respond to common points here. Most comments are positive, which is great because this answer was supposed to be positive. Some are more critical, and that\u2019s great too because I like being kept on my toes and it gives me a chance to clarify a few things. Something I do understand is that India is highly divided country with a lot of poverty, particularly rural poverty. There\u2019s no sense in denying that. I\u2019ve travelled widely in the country, including to adivasi villages, a prolonged stay in Dharavi, Mumbai (which locals don\u2019t seem to visit themselves), and a long summer in suburban Varanasi teaching English and geography at a summer school for children from poor backgrounds (while studying Hindi myself). The question, however, was about some people, and I\u2019m a person and I can only speak from my own perspective. I am fortunate to have been born into a middle-class family and had a stable upbringing. I\u2019ve also had a good education and I\u2019m well-qualified. I had a particular desire to go to India because my godfather was born in Chennai back in the late 1940s (actually the year of independence) and he actually attended the same school I went to teach at with his brother. Growing up, a close family friend of ours also attended the same school. For me, it\u2019s a country I\u2019ve long been interested in and had a connection with. When an opportunity to teach there came up, I took it. I\u2019d never been to India and never left Europe before. I\u2019d never lived more than two hours away from the town I was born in, so it was a significant change for me! I went out there for one year and stayed for three, and I\u2019ve been back on holiday several times since. I mentioned finances. Money has never motivated me really, though I do enjoy some expensive hobbies like scuba diving! I worked in India on a local salary (and you can earn quite a bit more teaching than I did at some of the more famous/wealthier international schools) and I made very little effort to save money. I had fairly long school holidays and I took full advantage of them. That included trekking in Nepal, scuba diving in the Andaman Islands, and travelling by train and motorbike all over the place. I even had a maid (never had a maid before or since!). Among middle-class Indians, a maid is pretty normal. It\u2019s very abnormal in Britain. I still ended up saving money - I still have savings there in a bank account collecting a nice amount of interest (much more than in Britain). From my perspective, I had much more disposable income in India than in Britain. I had a nicer house there too, a maid, could eat out whenever I liked, etc. In Britain, I earn pretty much average. That money does not get you very far. I\u2019m not poor or anything like that, but I can forget about going on scuba diving holidays. Saving is challenging, and I\u2019m actually trying to now because I would like to buy my own home! Housing costs in the UK are genuinely ridiculous. Slums don\u2019t exist here, at least not ones like Dharavi, but slum-like conditions are emerging in parts of London and other parts of the country (The families living in modern day slums). It\u2019s getting worse. Proportionally, the salary I could command in India is miles above what I can command in the UK, with a corresponding difference in quality of life. The key word here is \u2018proportionally\u2019. Forget about absolute numbers. I both appreciate and understand that this difference is because there are a large number of people in India who have nothing because there is so much wealth division. In geography we talk about the Gini coefficient as a measure of wealth disparity. You can look up some stats here (Human Development Reports). It\u2019s worth pointing out that India is gradually becoming more equal, which is a good thing, while the UK (and especially the USA) are becoming less equal (bad). All that said, from my perspective, and mine alone, the quality of life is higher. Some people have also mentioned the wisdom of having immigration from the west to India. Why does a school need me when there are plenty of perfectly well-qualified teachers in India? Good question. Something I quickly learnt in India was that the term \u2018international\u2019 is basically meaningless when discussing education. Check out this answer: Which are the top 10 international schools in India? The school I worked at is mentioned in a few of these answers, and actually is an international school. It followed the British exam system and had roughly 50% of its students and staff come from India. The other 50% came from all over the place: South Korea, USA, UK, parts of Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Nepal, Thailand, etc. I.e. it\u2019s actually international. Most international schools in India are not like this: their students and staff come almost entirely from India. Teaching British exams requires knowledge of the British syllabus and western teaching methods. This is very, very different to ICSE/Indian teaching methods. I worked with Indian teachers who were exceptionally competent, highly talented people, but adapting to a different style of teaching and syllabus is challenging and having such a diverse school does require diverse teaching staff to reflect that. International schools exist in Britain too. They exist all over the place. I grew up next door to a Japanese school where, naturally, most of the teaching staff were Japanese. Today\u2019s economy is global and India is a major part of it. Whether globalisation is a good or bad thing is a whole other discussion, but it\u2019s here to stay whether Trump, Modi and British Brexiteers like it or not. India\u2019s economy benefits directly from it - major Indian firms operate overseas (e.g. Tata Steel and Cobra Beer in the UK) and the same is true in reverse. For that to work, cultural exchange is necessary. I have a profound respect for India and its people, a genuine one, not because of yoga and ashrams and that pseudo-spirituality that many westerners seem to like. I don\u2019t pretend to understand everything about the country - it\u2019s a complex and diverse place, and I find that fascinating, and that\u2019s why I continue to learn. I also acknowledge that it\u2019s not perfect. I experienced first-hand the corruption and violence that exists there. I also had an unpleasant experience getting mugged in New Delhi once and went to the police, who were downright useless. They kept trying to get me to change my statement from, \u2018my wallet was stolen\u2019 to \u2018my wallet was lost\u2019 and said it meant the same thing, which it really isn\u2019t. Britain is a great place too, and I especially think the British police are fantastic! I love my country (in a non-weirdly nationalist way), its culture and people. I have a good life here. However, I\u2019m not blind to its own flaws and will happily point them out. I\u2019d quite like to combine the both of European and Indian living - that\u2019d be perfect!",
            "I was born in India. Traveled to 10 countries so far, the largest country, the richest country, strongest country - I have been there. What\u2019s the difference? There\u2019s no one.

We stopped at Singapore while going to Australia and at Hong Kong while returning. In Australia, we visited Gold Coast and Sydney in addition to Melbourne. It was our first experience of going abroad and we were truly mesmerized and deeply impressed by the development of these countries, particularly Australia. Australia was extremely beautiful and appeared to be an ideal country to live in. But, we also encountered problems.All the services including transportation were extremely expensive.It was almost impossible to get vegetarian food. It was too expensive in any decent restaurant.You can\u2019t talk to locals even in English as their accent is quite different.The racial superiority complex of the locals was quite visible.In our hotels, we had televisions which showed many local channels. However, there was too much nudity on these programmes that we would not dare to play any of these channels except the news channel as our children were sharing rooms with us. We stayed in these countries for more than two weeks. However, by the end of the tour we got exasperated and bored of these journeys and desperately wanted to come back to India. I still remember the joy we felt when we boarded the Air India flight from Hong Kong. They served us hot Indian food including mattar-paneer and started showing \u2018Munna Bhai MBBS\u2019 on the screen. It was great joy to see many Indians on the plane. We were extremely happy to return to India. India is us and we are India. You can\u2019t separate India from Indians irrespective of where they go and where they live. There is nothing like living in India, if you are an Indian. However, you can realize this truth only if you have been abroad for some time.",
            "Alright, I\u2019ll do this in alphabetical order.Algeria: The Sahara Desert engulfs about 90% of Africa\u2019s largest country. Last year in January, the Algerian Sahara experienced snowfall, something that has only happened to the world\u2019s largest hot desert 3 times in the past 40 years.Angola: In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, part of Angola was ruled by a nation-state called the Kingdom of Ndongo, also known as Dongo. The king or queen of Ndongo was called an ngola - hence the country\u2019s modern name.Benin: In Benin, it is considered bad etiquette to eat with your left hand, or worse still, giContinue ReadingAlright, I\u2019ll do this in alphabetical order.Algeria: The Sahara Desert engulfs about 90% of Africa\u2019s largest country.

The king or queen of Ndongo was called an ngola - hence the country\u2019s modern name.Benin: In Benin, it is considered bad etiquette to eat with your left hand, or worse still, give a handshake with your left hand.Botswana: Botswana is home to the Okavango Delta, the largest inland delta in the world. The Okavango river doesn\u2019t flow into a sea or lake, it just peters out in the middle of the land. The delta has an area of 15,000 square kilometres and some 150,000 islands.Burkina Faso: This country is one of the richest in art and culture in Africa. One Burkinab\u00e9 ethnic group, the Bobo, are known for their exquisite masks. During fertility ceremonies, painted butterfly masks are worn to invoke a god known as Do.Burundi: The Ruzizi River of Burundi is the haunt of the infamous Gustave. Gustave could be the world\u2019s largest Nile crocodile, and the deaths of over 300 people have been attributed to him. He\u2019s also survived direct gunfire and allegedly kills and eats fully grown hippos. He was the inspiration for the (mediocre) 2007 film Primeval.Cape Verde: This often-forgotten archipelago was the first-ever tropical European settlement, as it was colonized by the Portuguese in 1462. It went on to become an important stop for sailors on long voyages and both Columbus and Elcano (Magellan\u2019s successor) resupplied there.Cameroon: Cameroon is the primary home of the aptly named goliath frog, the largest frog in the world. About a foot long, the adults have been known to eat very large prey like other frogs, turtles, snakes and even bats.Central African Republic: The CAR is the possible hideout of Joseph Kony, one of the world\u2019s most wanted men. The warlord and his supporters - who believe him to have mystical powers - have led a brutal 26-year campaign to overthrow the Ugandan government, committing unspeakable atrocities along the way.Chad: Thousands of years ago in the African Humid Period, the Sahara was green, and Lake Chad was probably the largest lake in the world. At over 402,000 square kilometers in area, it would have outsized the Caspian Sea and made its modern equivalent look like a pond.Comoros: Comoros is home to the main population of West Indian coelacanths. In 1938, a trawler first turned up one of these strange fish, and it was later identified as a coelacanth - a type of animal which was thought to have gone extinct hundreds of millions of years ago! The discovery shocked the world.DR Congo: After a 5-year term starting in 2006, Congolese president Joseph Kabila secured a controversial second term. Then, in 2016 when his time was up, he refused to leave office. Elections were delayed three times, and Kabila bought himself a further two illegal years as president.Congo Republic: Here you can find Diosso Gorge, also known as the \u201cGrand Canyon of the Congo\u201d because of its spectacular red cliffs. Despite its natural beauty, the country\u2019s director of environment once approved the dumping of 1 million tons of toxic waste into the gorge.Cote d\u2019Ivoire: In this nation\u2019s capital, Yamoussoukro, you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s largest church, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. It was completed in 1989, and estimates say it may have costed up to 600 million US dollars.Djibouti: The lake of Lac Assal, Djibouti, is the second-saltiest water body in the world, after a pond in Antarctica. 10 times saltier than the ocean, the waters are so saline that they are devoid of any aquatic fauna whatsoever.Egypt: According to archaeological evidence, the Great Pyramids were not built by toiling slaves, but trained, salaried workers. These free men would have worked for shifts of 3\u20134 months, living in a nearby camp where they were fed, watered and received medical attention.Equatorial Guinea: The capital of Equatorial Guinea is Malabo, situated on an offshore island - making it one of the only countries with a capital not on the mainland. However, a new capital, Oyala, is under construction, set to be complete by 2020.Eritrea: What is now Eritrea was the site of the mysterious Iron Age kingdom of D\u2019mt, one of the first advanced civilizations in Sub-Saharan Africa. The kingdom emerged at around 1,000 BC, and disappeared for unknown reasons in ~400 BC.eSwatini: Never heard of this one? That\u2019s because, until 2018, it was known as Swaziland. It was renamed eSwatini, meaning \u201cland of the Swazis\u201d, by King Mswati III, pictured below. He\u2019s allowed to do that because he\u2019s one of the world\u2019s very few absolute monarchs.Ethiopia: Though it\u2019s very controversial, some say Ethiopia was never colonized by Europeans. In the famous Battle of Adwa, an Italian colonial army of less than 18,000 was met by an Ethiopian force of 100,000 soldiers, many of them wielding swords and spears. And the Africans won.Gabon: This is one of the most promising African countries for wildlife conservation, as it is fairly prosperous, politically stable and biodiverse. Of the nation\u2019s rainforests, which make up 85% of its area, a whole 11% is dedicated to natural parks and wildlife reservations.The Gambia: The highest point in all of the Gambia is the aptly named Red Rock - which is a measly 53 metres above sea level! I couldn\u2019t find any good pictures, but from what I\u2019ve read\u2026 yeah, it\u2019s basically just a red rock. Here\u2019s a random picture of Gambia instead.Ghana: The Akan people of Ghana often name their children after the day of the week they were born on. Similar to a horoscope, the day of birth is also thought to influence the child\u2019s future personality and profession.Guinea: Despite being rather small for a country (though as an Irishman I can\u2019t say much), roughly a quarter of all the known bauxite in the world is found in Guinea. Bauxite is a reddish rock and the world\u2019s main source of aluminium, and is mined on a huge scale in Guinea.Guinea-Bissau: Unfortunately, despite once being hailed as a potential model for development, this is one of the poorest countries in the world. In a typical sample of 1,000 Bissau-Guineans, 15 have Internet access, 8 have a landline and only 1 has a mobile phone.Kenya: Some of the earliest human remains known have been found in Kenya, leading some to hypothesize that humans first evolved in what is now this country or near it. As a result, the region is nicknamed the \u201cCradle of Humanity\u201d.Lesotho: This is the only country in the world situated entirely over 1,000 metres above sea level, and one of two where the average altitude is more than 2,000 metres. Hence, it\u2019s often referred to as the Kingdom of the Sky.Liberia: This nation was founded and created exclusively for the purpose of being a place where freed African-American slaves could migrate to and live. Its first ever president, Joseph Jenkins Roberts, was a former slave from Virginia.Libya: Overall, Libya is perhaps the driest and hottest country in the whole world. Its average annual precipitation is 55 millimeters - compare that to the USA\u2019s 1,035. Sometimes, here, a drop of rain doesn\u2019t fall for decades at a time.Madagascar: Excluding Antarctica, Madagascar was the second-last significant landmass to be reached by humans - it was only settled at around 500 AD. And despite it being less than 400 km off the African coast, African colonists were beaten to the island by Austronesians from across the Indian Ocean!Malawi: Lake Malawi is Africa\u2019s third largest and second deepest lake, and has more fish species than any lake in the world, at an estimated 1,000. In the rainy season, millions of midges hatch beneath the surface and emerge, forming impossibly huge swarms like plumes of smoke. This is, in fact, the largest gathering of animals on Earth.Mali: The Bandiagara Escarpment, Mali, is a huge sandstone cliff dotted with Dogon villages of cliff-dwellings. While the architecture is very impressive, it is extremely inadvisable to visit as violence occurs there on a daily basis.Mauritania: Mauritania was the last country to abolish slavery, which it only did in 1981. Despite this, it\u2019s thought that there are still over 90,000 slaves still in Mauritania.Mauritius: The famous dodo bird of Mauritius is usually depicted as a plump, awkward bird with dull grey plumage. However, a 1625 painting by Ustad Mansur, famed for his accuracy, confirms that it was slimmer and more elegant than we thought, with a rich brown and gold colour scheme.Morocco: The Ouarzazate Solar Power Station, Morocco, is the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. When finished, it will produce 582 megawatts, saving us from over 700,000 megatons of CO2, and have cost an expected $9 billion.Mozambique: Mozambique\u2019s Gorongosa was once a national park rich in wildlife - however, in the \u201880s, the area was ravaged by brutal civil war and turned into a wasteland. But thanks to a $10 million, 8-year restoration effort, it is once more a thriving ecosystem of spectacular fauna.Namibia: In Namibia\u2019s Namib Desert (the oldest desert in the world, having been around for 80 million years) you can find the tallest dune in the world, known as Big Daddy. Big Daddy is indeed big, as it\u2019s a staggering 325 meters tall. It faces another large dune, appropriately named Big Mama.Niger: In 1796, the Scotsman Mungo Park became the first European to travel the course of the river Niger, having brushes with death with hippopotamuses and tribal armies along the way. He went on a second expedition to the river in 1803, and drowned as he was chased into the water by spear-wielding natives.Nigeria: Nigeria has its own film industry, known as \u201cNollywood\u201d, which produces an impressive ~10,000 films every year. Nollywood films are famously cheesy and often repeat clich\u00e9s. They\u2019ve also been the source of a few memes well-known in the Western World\u2026Rwanda: The Rwandan capital, Kigali, is hailed as Africa\u2019s cleanest city. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on reducing traffic, improving services and cleaning up waste, and the head of the UN Environment Program went so far as to call it the \u201ccleanest city on the planet\u201d.S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe: As Africa\u2019s smallest country in terms of both area and population, there are only six banks in the whole island nation.Senegal: The world\u2019s largest collection of megalithic structures is in Senegal - the Senegambian Stone Circles.

The RUF, a brutal revolutionary group, were making $125 million yearly from diamond mining, and so the UN imposed sanctions on diamonds until the war ended.Somalia: In 2010, professional badass Mike Spencer Bown shocked Somali authorities by declaring himself a tourist - the first in the war-torn nation in decades. Over 23 years of travel, Brown has been to every country in the world, visited Saddam Hussein\u2019s home town, caught malaria twice and been arrested countless times.South Africa: What do you think of when you hear \u201cAfrican wildlife\u201d? Penguins? I doubt it. However, many South African beaches are home to colonies of African penguins, unique to SA and Namibia. Chances are you\u2019ve seen an African penguin, too, as they\u2019re very popular with zoos.South Sudan: In 2016, inflation in South Sudan soared to a shocking 835.7 percent, one of the highest inflation rates recorded. Despite the nation having abundant oil, most in South Sudan are crippled by poverty.Sudan: At 350, Sudan has well over twice as many pyramids as Egypt does - only its were not built by the ancient Egyptians. Rather, they were the work of Nubia, an early African civilization which had mixed relations with Egypt.Tanzania: The Tanzania-Kenya border, which is otherwise fairly straight, swerves unusually so that Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania. This is because of a 19th Century agreement between Britain and Germany - British Kenya got the port of Mombasa, while German Tanganyika got the mountain.Togo: In 2005, the Togolese president died and a man called Fambare Natchaba was supposed to take his place - however, he was out of the country at the time.

The takeover resulted in mass uprisings and countless deaths.Tunisia: Matmata is a town in southern Tunisia where the local Berbers build underground dwellings to take refuge from the blazing sun. The houses consist of large pits with artificial caves around the perimeter. Matmata was also the site of most scenes on Tatooine in the Star Wars films.Uganda: Roughly one quarter of Uganda\u2019s area is taken up by lakes and rivers - the highest ratio of water area to land area of any country, I think. Among these water bodies are Lakes Victoria, Kyoga, Albert, Edward and George. For a landlocked country, it certainly has plenty of water.Zambia: Zambia\u2019s Lake Kariba is the largest man-made lake in the world, at 5,580 square kilometres. Before filling Kariba, they burnt all the plants to clear the land. This has created a layer of highly fertile soil, and as a result, the reservoir has a thriving ecosystem of big game, fish, birds and more.Zimbabwe: In Medieval times, Zimbabwe was ruled by an empire known as the Kingdom of Zimbabwe. There are ruins of a huge stone city - known as Great Zimbabwe - which was likely the capital of this kingdom.Well, that\u2019s got to be one of the longest answers I\u2019ve ever written.

            "Alright, I\u2019ll do this in alphabetical order.Algeria: The Sahara Desert engulfs about 90% of Africa\u2019s largest country. Last year in January, the Algerian Sahara experienced snowfall, something that has only happened to the world\u2019s largest hot desert 3 times in the past 40 years.Angola: In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, part of Angola was ruled by a nation-state called the Kingdom of Ndongo, also known as Dongo. The king or queen of Ndongo was called an ngola - hence the country\u2019s modern name.Benin: In Benin, it is considered bad etiquette to eat with your left hand, or worse still, giContinue ReadingAlright, I\u2019ll do this in alphabetical order.Algeria: The Sahara Desert engulfs about 90% of Africa\u2019s largest country. Last year in January, the Algerian Sahara experienced snowfall, something that has only happened to the world\u2019s largest hot desert 3 times in the past 40 years.Angola: In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, part of Angola was ruled by a nation-state called the Kingdom of Ndongo, also known as Dongo. The king or queen of Ndongo was called an ngola - hence the country\u2019s modern name.Benin: In Benin, it is considered bad etiquette to eat with your left hand, or worse still, give a handshake with your left hand.Botswana: Botswana is home to the Okavango Delta, the largest inland delta in the world. The Okavango river doesn\u2019t flow into a sea or lake, it just peters out in the middle of the land. The delta has an area of 15,000 square kilometres and some 150,000 islands.Burkina Faso: This country is one of the richest in art and culture in Africa. One Burkinab\u00e9 ethnic group, the Bobo, are known for their exquisite masks. During fertility ceremonies, painted butterfly masks are worn to invoke a god known as Do.Burundi: The Ruzizi River of Burundi is the haunt of the infamous Gustave. Gustave could be the world\u2019s largest Nile crocodile, and the deaths of over 300 people have been attributed to him. He\u2019s also survived direct gunfire and allegedly kills and eats fully grown hippos. He was the inspiration for the (mediocre) 2007 film Primeval.Cape Verde: This often-forgotten archipelago was the first-ever tropical European settlement, as it was colonized by the Portuguese in 1462. It went on to become an important stop for sailors on long voyages and both Columbus and Elcano (Magellan\u2019s successor) resupplied there.Cameroon: Cameroon is the primary home of the aptly named goliath frog, the largest frog in the world. About a foot long, the adults have been known to eat very large prey like other frogs, turtles, snakes and even bats.Central African Republic: The CAR is the possible hideout of Joseph Kony, one of the world\u2019s most wanted men. The warlord and his supporters - who believe him to have mystical powers - have led a brutal 26-year campaign to overthrow the Ugandan government, committing unspeakable atrocities along the way.Chad: Thousands of years ago in the African Humid Period, the Sahara was green, and Lake Chad was probably the largest lake in the world. At over 402,000 square kilometers in area, it would have outsized the Caspian Sea and made its modern equivalent look like a pond.Comoros: Comoros is home to the main population of West Indian coelacanths. In 1938, a trawler first turned up one of these strange fish, and it was later identified as a coelacanth - a type of animal which was thought to have gone extinct hundreds of millions of years ago! The discovery shocked the world.DR Congo: After a 5-year term starting in 2006, Congolese president Joseph Kabila secured a controversial second term. Then, in 2016 when his time was up, he refused to leave office. Elections were delayed three times, and Kabila bought himself a further two illegal years as president.Congo Republic: Here you can find Diosso Gorge, also known as the \u201cGrand Canyon of the Congo\u201d because of its spectacular red cliffs. Despite its natural beauty, the country\u2019s director of environment once approved the dumping of 1 million tons of toxic waste into the gorge.Cote d\u2019Ivoire: In this nation\u2019s capital, Yamoussoukro, you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s largest church, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. It was completed in 1989, and estimates say it may have costed up to 600 million US dollars.Djibouti: The lake of Lac Assal, Djibouti, is the second-saltiest water body in the world, after a pond in Antarctica. 10 times saltier than the ocean, the waters are so saline that they are devoid of any aquatic fauna whatsoever.Egypt: According to archaeological evidence, the Great Pyramids were not built by toiling slaves, but trained, salaried workers. These free men would have worked for shifts of 3\u20134 months, living in a nearby camp where they were fed, watered and received medical attention.Equatorial Guinea: The capital of Equatorial Guinea is Malabo, situated on an offshore island - making it one of the only countries with a capital not on the mainland. However, a new capital, Oyala, is under construction, set to be complete by 2020.Eritrea: What is now Eritrea was the site of the mysterious Iron Age kingdom of D\u2019mt, one of the first advanced civilizations in Sub-Saharan Africa. The kingdom emerged at around 1,000 BC, and disappeared for unknown reasons in ~400 BC.eSwatini: Never heard of this one? That\u2019s because, until 2018, it was known as Swaziland. It was renamed eSwatini, meaning \u201cland of the Swazis\u201d, by King Mswati III, pictured below. He\u2019s allowed to do that because he\u2019s one of the world\u2019s very few absolute monarchs.Ethiopia: Though it\u2019s very controversial, some say Ethiopia was never colonized by Europeans. In the famous Battle of Adwa, an Italian colonial army of less than 18,000 was met by an Ethiopian force of 100,000 soldiers, many of them wielding swords and spears. And the Africans won.Gabon: This is one of the most promising African countries for wildlife conservation, as it is fairly prosperous, politically stable and biodiverse. Of the nation\u2019s rainforests, which make up 85% of its area, a whole 11% is dedicated to natural parks and wildlife reservations.The Gambia: The highest point in all of the Gambia is the aptly named Red Rock - which is a measly 53 metres above sea level! I couldn\u2019t find any good pictures, but from what I\u2019ve read\u2026 yeah, it\u2019s basically just a red rock. Here\u2019s a random picture of Gambia instead.Ghana: The Akan people of Ghana often name their children after the day of the week they were born on. Similar to a horoscope, the day of birth is also thought to influence the child\u2019s future personality and profession.Guinea: Despite being rather small for a country (though as an Irishman I can\u2019t say much), roughly a quarter of all the known bauxite in the world is found in Guinea. Bauxite is a reddish rock and the world\u2019s main source of aluminium, and is mined on a huge scale in Guinea.Guinea-Bissau: Unfortunately, despite once being hailed as a potential model for development, this is one of the poorest countries in the world. In a typical sample of 1,000 Bissau-Guineans, 15 have Internet access, 8 have a landline and only 1 has a mobile phone.Kenya: Some of the earliest human remains known have been found in Kenya, leading some to hypothesize that humans first evolved in what is now this country or near it. As a result, the region is nicknamed the \u201cCradle of Humanity\u201d.Lesotho: This is the only country in the world situated entirely over 1,000 metres above sea level, and one of two where the average altitude is more than 2,000 metres. Hence, it\u2019s often referred to as the Kingdom of the Sky.Liberia: This nation was founded and created exclusively for the purpose of being a place where freed African-American slaves could migrate to and live. Its first ever president, Joseph Jenkins Roberts, was a former slave from Virginia.Libya: Overall, Libya is perhaps the driest and hottest country in the whole world. Its average annual precipitation is 55 millimeters - compare that to the USA\u2019s 1,035. Sometimes, here, a drop of rain doesn\u2019t fall for decades at a time.Madagascar: Excluding Antarctica, Madagascar was the second-last significant landmass to be reached by humans - it was only settled at around 500 AD. And despite it being less than 400 km off the African coast, African colonists were beaten to the island by Austronesians from across the Indian Ocean!Malawi: Lake Malawi is Africa\u2019s third largest and second deepest lake, and has more fish species than any lake in the world, at an estimated 1,000. In the rainy season, millions of midges hatch beneath the surface and emerge, forming impossibly huge swarms like plumes of smoke. This is, in fact, the largest gathering of animals on Earth.Mali: The Bandiagara Escarpment, Mali, is a huge sandstone cliff dotted with Dogon villages of cliff-dwellings. While the architecture is very impressive, it is extremely inadvisable to visit as violence occurs there on a daily basis.Mauritania: Mauritania was the last country to abolish slavery, which it only did in 1981. Despite this, it\u2019s thought that there are still over 90,000 slaves still in Mauritania.Mauritius: The famous dodo bird of Mauritius is usually depicted as a plump, awkward bird with dull grey plumage. However, a 1625 painting by Ustad Mansur, famed for his accuracy, confirms that it was slimmer and more elegant than we thought, with a rich brown and gold colour scheme.Morocco: The Ouarzazate Solar Power Station, Morocco, is the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. When finished, it will produce 582 megawatts, saving us from over 700,000 megatons of CO2, and have cost an expected $9 billion.Mozambique: Mozambique\u2019s Gorongosa was once a national park rich in wildlife - however, in the \u201880s, the area was ravaged by brutal civil war and turned into a wasteland. But thanks to a $10 million, 8-year restoration effort, it is once more a thriving ecosystem of spectacular fauna.Namibia: In Namibia\u2019s Namib Desert (the oldest desert in the world, having been around for 80 million years) you can find the tallest dune in the world, known as Big Daddy. Big Daddy is indeed big, as it\u2019s a staggering 325 meters tall. It faces another large dune, appropriately named Big Mama.Niger: In 1796, the Scotsman Mungo Park became the first European to travel the course of the river Niger, having brushes with death with hippopotamuses and tribal armies along the way. He went on a second expedition to the river in 1803, and drowned as he was chased into the water by spear-wielding natives.Nigeria: Nigeria has its own film industry, known as \u201cNollywood\u201d, which produces an impressive ~10,000 films every year. Nollywood films are famously cheesy and often repeat clich\u00e9s. They\u2019ve also been the source of a few memes well-known in the Western World\u2026Rwanda: The Rwandan capital, Kigali, is hailed as Africa\u2019s cleanest city. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on reducing traffic, improving services and cleaning up waste, and the head of the UN Environment Program went so far as to call it the \u201ccleanest city on the planet\u201d.S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Principe: As Africa\u2019s smallest country in terms of both area and population, there are only six banks in the whole island nation.Senegal: The world\u2019s largest collection of megalithic structures is in Senegal - the Senegambian Stone Circles. Covering an area of 30,000 square kilometres, there are some 29,000 pillar-like stones forming a total of 17,000 rings, built by some mysterious ancient civilization.Seychelles: This archipelago is the sole home of Lodoicea maldivica, a palm species which holds 5 botanical world records: the largest fruit (42 kilograms), the largest seeds (17.6 kilograms, pictured), the longest cotyledons (4 metres), and the most efficient recovery of nutrients from dead leaves.Sierra Leone: During its recent civil war, Sierra Leone was an infamous producer of blood diamonds - diamonds mined to fund war. The RUF, a brutal revolutionary group, were making $125 million yearly from diamond mining, and so the UN imposed sanctions on diamonds until the war ended.Somalia: In 2010, professional badass Mike Spencer Bown shocked Somali authorities by declaring himself a tourist - the first in the war-torn nation in decades.

Rather, they were the work of Nubia, an early African civilization which had mixed relations with Egypt.Tanzania: The Tanzania-Kenya border, which is otherwise fairly straight, swerves unusually so that Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania. This is because of a 19th Century agreement between Britain and Germany - British Kenya got the port of Mombasa, while German Tanganyika got the mountain.Togo: In 2005, the Togolese president died and a man called Fambare Natchaba was supposed to take his place - however, he was out of the country at the time.

I mention that I grew up \u201cin Florida\" because most people don't know what Florida is. They know what The Beach is, they know what Disney is, but they don't know diddly about the FLA. Florida wants to kill you. It hates you. It hates humans. It wants to return back to the ocean floor. There are insects as big as your hand. The palmetto bug is a gigantic roach. It's disgusting, but generally harmless. The Asian Cockroach is a harbinger of doom. It can fly, it is agressive and it considers you the pest. You will have them. But, again, relatively harmless. The black widows, brown recluse, scorpions and fire ants will hurt you. They will hurt you bad. The snakes will kill you. If it is venomous or poisonous (there's a difference; you know), it lives in Florida. We've even imported boa constrictors and pythons to spruce things up a bit. We also have the wonderful alligators and odd croc to contend with. Oh, and don't forget that the flies and mosquitoes were known for spreading some serious diseases. The plants will kill you. Many are poisonous. If the word poison is in the name, we got it: ivy, sumac and oak. Palmetto smoke isn't particularly healthy. The Spanish moss is chigger-infested. The ground will kill you. Sink holes are a serious thing. They make Earthquakes seem quaint at times. One day, you're enjoying your day, amd the next, your home is swallowed by the Earth. The heat. If you live north of I-70, you're going to die. Sure, the desert is hotter, but it\u2019s nice and dry out there. Sweat works. Shade works. Not in Florida. If you go sit in the shade in Florida, you are hot in the dark. Rain cools nothing off. It just makes it more muggy. The humidity is 100% on a dry day. You take a shower and towel off and towel off and towel off and towel off, and then you realize, I'm just sweating. If you want to know what it's like in Florida in August, get a heat lamp, take into a sauna then pee on yourself. Get the sauna as steamy as you can, and then get under the lamp. Welcome to the Sunshine State. The people. There are three types of people in Florida: old people, tourists and people waiting to go insane. My neighbors were Harold and Natalie Goldstein. Great people. I loved them dearly. When we moved in next door, they were in their early 70s. Harold was a retired NYC mail man. His wife was a housewife all her life. They were born, raised and lived in Brooklyn. Harold learned to drive in WWII. Natalie never did. Until she moved to Florida. She got her first driver's license at the age of 69. Think about that. Her story was not unique. Florida is the home of the worst drivers on Earth. People in Boston drive differently from people in LA. People from Minneapolis drive differently from those in St. Louis. Jamaicans aim their cars differently than Koreans and Cuban aim their cars. They all end up in Florida \u2014 either as old people or tourists. Tourists are angry. They've traveled a long way with the family to spend all of their money, sweat, get a sunburn and then return home more exhausted than when they arrived. I go to Orlando International to watch misery. Disney is called the happiest place on Earth. Orlando International is the home of despair, anger and lost souls. Because of the other two groups, everyone else is waiting to snap. And it happens a lot. I got out before it happened. But my county, Pasco, is the land of the lost. Eventually, you become Florida Man. Search it. As a matter of fact, search your birthday and month with \u201cFlorida Man\" just to see what pops up. It's called the \u201cFlorida Man Challenge.\u201d You won't be disappointed; or maybe you will. I won't mention the hurricanes. They're kind of fun. PCB and Mexico beach are already up and running after last year's big storms. The worst thing that usually comes is a few days of the liquor stores being sold out. So, go ahead, move to Florida. You've been warned.",
            "Don't. We arrived on the east coast of Florida two weeks ago from Colorado.

My husband, a subcontractor for a large nationwide company, and also a small business owner, was promised a ridiculous amount of business to transfer to Orlando, where the rent is half of what we were paying up North. Upon arrival he learned that business doesn't happen in December, in January, or in February. The office managers play Candy Crush from 8\u20135 and don't sell jobs, the salesmen aren't very motivated or very good, and apparently they take winters off. Surprise! Plan B, obtain reasonably paid work until he can establish his business here. My husband just returned minutes ago from a job interview in Melbourne where the owner of the company said the f-word a dozen times in the first five minutes. He offered my husband, who typically averages $60\u201380 per hour, $10 to \u201croll screen.\u201d My husband was a bit confused, as he was there to interview for a metal roofing position. Also confused because although he did not expect $60, he certainly didn't expect $10 on 20 years of experience either. According to the owner, not everyone can roll screen, it takes a real smart person to do it. It's evidently quite difficult and takes a great deal of skill to unroll window screen and use a stapler or small soldering gun to attach it to a frame, apparently. The owner included he normally only hires Brazilians as they are \u201cgrateful\u201d and don't call in sick all the time. My husband overheard from the secretary that his resume had too many big words in it. This is actually similar to the other five interviews my husband had this week along the Space Coast. He returned, incredulous and bug-eyed. \u201cWe're going back North,\u201d he stated matter-of-factly, \u201cWhere people aren't intimidated by talent and education, and aren't slow.\u201d Dang, I thought, that's a bit harsh. Then he relayed his experience. You wanna move here? Be a professional before you show up. I mean a doctor, a lawyer, even a nurse. Otherwise, I'd say, don't. Not because nature is against you, not because of tourists and the elderly, but because you will be treated like dirt by fat fucks who look like they escaped Farmer Brown's pigpen. Employers here are looking to low-ball and abuse a certain population, not pay for quality. We hated Orlando, it reminded us of a thousand episodes of \u201cCOPS\u201d we watched growing up. Also several episodes of \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d Perhaps it will be different for you. This may not be everyone's experience, but it was ours. Take it with a grain of salt.",

The fact that most people are from someplace else means that you aren\u2019t trying to break into a circle of friends who\u2019ve been pals since grade school and you can make your own friends. I also like that there are people here from all over: WASPS, immigrants, Crackers, African Americans, Conchs, etc. we don\u2019t always get along but we usually try and also succeed. If you don\u2019t want to have only work-friends, volunteer somewhere even one evening a week to meet new people. Look at the elections map. If you are more conservative you are probably going to be happier on the Gulf Coast. If you are more democratic/progressive, look at communities on the Atlantic Coast. There are exceptions to this but it\u2019s something to consider. Be nice to the tourists\u2014the tax on hotels makes up for you not paying income tax. Enjoy the wildlife. We have great bird sanctuaries etc. For serious culture, live close to a big city. Same thing for serious health problems. The air is very clean here (where I\u2019ve lived anyway) and the humidity is good for your skin. If you relish the breeze, live near the coast. The middle of the state is considerably hotter. Hurricanes are not to be taken lightly but then there are earthquakes, floods, or tornadoes to deal with in other states. Pick your disaster. If you hate the heat, don\u2019t come. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s much hotter here, it\u2019s that summer goes on forever and one longs for an autumn day. Where I live, summer lasts from May to October. We had hotter days in Kentucky and certainly in Manhattan but not nearly as many. Use the weather app on your phone to compare where you live now to your location in Florida. Finally, don\u2019t be sure you are settled until a year has passed. We have a different lifestyle here\u2014-usually more casual and laid back.",

It\u2019s no joke here it\u2019s hot all the time and if your air conditioner breaks in the middle of August it\u2019s not a pleasant feeling and it can take a long time just to find someone willing to fix it. I found that you really have to have a good paying job when moving here. Most good paying jobs are away from the beach so I would think about not moving to Miami Beach unless your industry is in hospitality or real estate or remote work. I feel like Miami Beach is a bit overrated. It\u2019s very tourist oriented and it\u2019s always busy. Again you should realize that before moving to the beach. If I could have changed things I would not have moved to the beach for those reasons. The rent is very high and you really need at least 5,000 per month or more to survive. People are not very friendly and mostly keep to themselves. It\u2019s very materialistic stores shops everywhere luxury rentals and cars; it\u2019s good if you have the funds to frequent the stores and I know a lot of them promote tourism. Just like people have said Miami is for some people and not for others. Also good to remember that Miami is a different city from Miami Beach. Our rent due to inflation is going to be 2,500 or 2,600 per month I really wish we would have saw this coming or we never would have relocated here so we\u2019re trying to move back to where we are from. Our original rent was 2,000 per month for this year which was a good deal I now realize. Do not move here blindly you must come and visit first. You should visit around July or August to see if you can handle the weather. The traffic is not good and the drivers are not very kind it takes a long time to get places. The cities are beautiful here. The parks by the beach are very nice. There is a lot to do all the time. Those are all positives. The food is delicious. If you can afford Miami Beach then you will do fine but if your on a fixed income it is not a good idea to move here or you will struggle. The rent waiting lists are so long that my husband and I are looking to move back to where we are from. I really am beginning to think people are right that most people in Miami live at home because with the scarcity of high paying jobs I\u2019m not sure how people survive here. My husband lived in Miami several years ago and said it was very different than it is now it wasn\u2019t as popular back then. We did not realize how many people were moving down here to south Florida looking back on it I wish we would have done more research and not have moved here at this time to have contributed to the inflation and soaring rent prices. I really feel bad for the locals who live here because the visitors are raising the rent and housing prices. Please do your research before moving here. It\u2019s coming from a person who wishes they did. You may want to wait until the soaring rent prices stabilize."

Death rates in some groups and some countries are much higher. Some of those who become infected will become seriously ill and require specialized treatment in ICU. Some will have longterm health problems, even after a mild infection. The biggest problem that I see is that we simply do not know who is vulnerable to Covid-19 until they get it and become seriously ill or die. At first it was thought that Covid-19 was a respiratory system infection. But then young people started dying of strokes caused by blood clots in their brains. People started turning up with gut issues. Children in Europe, the UK, and the USA are being hospitalized with Kawasaki\u2019s disease caused by Covid-19. Some people are experiencing damage to their kidneys. The virus has already mutated to the point where there are a couple of strains that can be identified to region. This is how we know that the USA was infected by people coming from Europe, not from China. The virus could mutate again, and again, and again. Some strains might be more virulent, and others could be weaker. To be honest, I think we\u2019re going to have to learn to live with Covid-19. I think that there\u2019s...",

But I\u2019m not exactly sharing the same conclusion. Let\u2019s review some facts or findings. SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus, which means it mutates on average faster than a DNA virus. Therefore, more virus strains for which we need a workable vaccine. Also that means lower longevity of antibody based immune response. To be really effective, to eradicate the disease, we need to hit it hard, with over 1 billion of vaccine doses (conservative number), and as soon as possible. The fact that another Spanish flu level influenza epidemic didn\u2019t emerge since 1918 doesn\u2019t means the virus lost its appetite to kill us or we are significant more immune. Sure, a virus (or a bacteria for that matter) doesn\u2019t really want to kill its host, but shit happens and the virus is not that smart to make always the right decision. It just means we are on average immune enough for the average influenza mutations. Leishmaniasis has, untreated, a CFR (case fatality ratio) of 100%, it kills every time and it\u2019s produced by a protozoan, considerably smarter than a virus. At any time we can see a mutation that makes influenza a bit more worrisome. Unlike influenza strains, SARS-CoV-2 is an unknown for our immune system. And it has significant heavier systemic (whole body) effects. No wonder it has a CFR of over 2% with over 10% in polymorbid cases. Compare with CFR 0.1% for influenza. It\u2019s quite hard to predict if it\u2019s going to become a tamed virus or it will want to challenge the Yersinia pestis historic records. It seems the most effective immune response is T-cell based immune response because it can kick in earlier than antibody-based immune response. But it will not if it is depleted. That should explain why elderly people develop more severe symptoms, the virus has more time to multiply at leisure. The T-cell based immune response can put pressure on the virus to evolve a mechanism to avoid it. It also gives time and a fecund ground for that, most asymptomatic or mild cases in younger people are not tested and isolated. I should add another point. While a good hygiene mentality (social distancing, masks wearing, hand washing and related) will not stop the virus getting to us 100%, it will reduce the viral load, giving our immune system more time to engage a more normal and effective response (antibody-based, without major inflammations or cytokine storms). In the long term, a culture based on those 3 principles can play a significant importance whether we get a vaccine or not. At least that\u2019s the lesson we get from South Korea and Japan experience. Bottom line, there is no reason to select the brighter outcome, as the things can get quite fast a lot more complicated and nasty. Most probably we will be able to develop a set of working vaccines, but we need them in huge enough quantities to reach some sort of global herd immunity and the sooner, the better. It\u2019s also possible that the exposed organism to develop a certain long-term partial immunity to not treat every seasonal infection as a new one, because if not, and in the absence of a vaccine, those young people who surfed today the disease will drown in it when they will grow old. This virus really has the potential to transform the human society and I don\u2019t really know if for the better or worse. My comments above can\u2019t close to a definitive answer, I think nobody can offer that, but merely more food for thought.",

My wife is one of those skilled office workers. In mid-March my wife, and about a thousand of her Chicago-based coworkers, were told to work from home for two weeks. She already worked from home two days per week anyway, so it was a smooth transition for her. Many of her coworkers had the same hybrid work in office/work from home setup. Two weeks became a month, then \u201cthrough August.\u201d Then her employer gave every worker a new desk and chair for their home offices if they wanted one\u2026 a really nice, corporate executive-type chair. Then they made the announcement: work from home for the rest of the calendar year. From everything I\u2019ve heard, their productivity has actually increased as they\u2019re all working from home. Employees are happier, more is getting done, and the company is saving money on things like making their office more comfortable, the office cafeteria, cleaning the office, etc\u2026 There is a strong possibility that, even when the pandemic is over, my wife will only have to go into the office once or twice per month. Some of her coworkers who had summer houses in other states have already moved out of Illinois and turned their summer homes into their permanent homes. We\u2019ve decided, for now at least, to invest in making her home office more comfortable for her. We\u2019re getting a separate AC/heat unit for it installed next week. Before this pandemic hit, we were looking to move out of Chicago and to the suburbs, for better schools, less crime, a bigger yard, and lower taxes. You know, the regular reasons people move to the suburbs. But we were still limited to suburbs around Chicago, all in Illinois, because she didn\u2019t want to commute very far. But now? If she only had to drive to her office once or twice per month, we could move to Indiana, where taxes are much, much lower. I can be a teacher anywhere, or just not work anymore if I wanted to. If this pandemic accelerates the growth in the \u201cwork from home\u201d model for office workers, and makes it the norm rather than the exception, millions of families like mine: affluent, two-parent, both college graduates, least likely to commit crimes and most likely to pay a lot in taxes\u2026 aka the exact types of citizens you\u2019d want in your city\u2026 millions of families like mine will leave the urban areas of America and flee to less dense, lower-taxed areas of the country. Note that, not only did the tax base flee Detroit, but Detroit\u2019s pension obligations from the 50s and 60s remained. Fewer people had to pay more in taxes for services that were performed a generation earlier. The same thing would happen in Chicago and other American cities. Fewer people, most of whom are lower on the socio-economic ladder as well, will be stuck with the bill for inflated city employee pensions\u2026 constantly paying more and more while getting less and less in services from the city. All of the things about urban living that appeal to younger, single people: nightlife, culture, public transportation, etc\u2026 Those are all temporary for most people. Once you settle down and begin raising a family, those quickly lose their appeal. Plus, with the money you\u2019d save from not living in the city, you can vacation to the city every now and then and get all of the culture you want. The property annual taxes on my house would more than cover a week-long stay at a 5-star downtown hotel, admission to every museum in the city, a couple of dinners at nice restaurants, and a couple of concerts.",

Now, I'm not usually someone who gets jealous, but this girl was taking things a bit too far. My boyfriend is super friendly and good looking. Sometimes people take this the wrong way. My boyfriend asked some questions about the ice cream and sizes. He got a large size with two different flavours. When she handed him the ice cream she winked and said \u201cyou look really familiar, have I seen you before?\u201d (* Which I know is a standard pick up line). My boyfriend replies \u201cI don't think so\u201d and looks the other way. Then she asked if I wanted anything, I asked for the exact same flavours and size as my boyfriend. Then she proceeds to give me HALF the size! Then she asks my boyfriend if it will be together or separate. He says it will be together. She gives me a dirty look, and upon giving him the receipt she says \u201coh wait, I have something else to give you, let me write it on the back of this receipt!\u201d It was her phone number. My boyfriend said he won't be needing it and to have a nice day. I was pretty upset but of course was too polite to tell the lady anything. EDIT: After reviewing the comments and reflecting more on the situation, I decided not to be so polite, and complain to the management. They apologized for her rude behaviours, gave a refund and free ice cream. Luckily, she was not working so I didn\u2019t have to see her face again either.",

And then I saw my sister in her wedding dress. She was looking like younger version of my mom. Tears started coming from my eyes.As you could see..I was controlling my emotions and she pulled my cheeks and started consoling me. After marriage she started meeting everyone during Bidaai ritual and I was hiding in public so that I could control myself and make myself not to cry. She came and stood in front of me as I was wiping my tears and said \u201c what happened to your song which you thought of singing ?\u201d I bursted out.I literally cried for straight 2 hours.

Some folks would start weeping when they realize that no longer would they be updated that their favorite celebrity posted a picture of themselves standing on a corner waiting to cross the street - but looking good in Jimmy choos and expensive jeans. A tweet would be the sound a bird makes and many would remember the times when the only popular tweet was \"tweety bird\" from loony tunes. Folks would dread the fact that they sold or donated the encyclopedias that used to be the way to find information because google and wikipedia would be unavailable. Libraries would see an uptick in subcribers and one of the most popular trending terms would be \"The dewey decimal system\".....through word of mouth. Google and Wikipedia would merge and become larger than the \"Library of Congress\" as a resource of information with annexes across the globe where patrons pay a monthly fee to access the stored information, becoming a hangout spot similar to starbucks where information is gained. Letters start to be written again but with unbelievable spelling errors. Since google's spelling assistance and automated spelcheck arent as accessable, people once again have to memorize the proper way to spell words. The memorization of phone numbers also upswing's as smart phones dont sell as well without internet access. English teachers and especially skilled voice coaches and acting teachers would have a phenomenal increase in the need of their talents because all of the celebrities whose claim to fame was \"facebook\" exposure, would now have to develop a skill to keep their incomes high. At home Teila Tequila gets on her knees thanking her higher power that this happened after she became famous. Amazon would buy the US postal system because people would still want stuff but since web commerce is no more, people would be forced to use snailmail to get the things that they want. Amazon improves efficiency sooo much that the shares that the US post office kept in the deal to Amazon, grows to an amount that satisfies half of the 10 trillion debt that the United States has on its books. Since online buying of stuff is no longer possible they would also buy up 500 cable channels turning them into the ultimate QVC and HSN's (home shopping Network) channels. Ebay does the same by buying up another 500 cable channels. The new \"Amazon shopping channel's\" and \"Ebay shopping channel's\" are born. For the first time in TV history something is always on, even if its only a channel selling something. When the channels go live, credit card issuers wipe their proverbial brow's as impulse spending slowly go back to former amounts. Netflix goes back to sending out Dvd's and Blurays because streaming video is no longer possible, but they have to sue Amazon first because Amazon has a monopoly on postal service and Amazon has to be forced to deliver a competitors items. They do, as the Federal Trade Commission steps in. The folks in the darknet that made their careers by doing all types of backroom stuff, would find out that all of the McDonalds, Burger King and other entry level jobs are already taken, forcing them to put on Suits and tie's to get the remaining tech jobs that may hire someone with their experience. Wall street is interested. Cd sales experience an serious rise in sales as downloading them goes to zero and the investment of the day are cd pressing plants as more needs to be built. All of the record companies contact AOL not because of their past position as the #1 internet service provider but because they also held the title as the most prolific user/purchaser of cd's - remember those AOL cd's that you got in the mail. How they did it is really important today. We gotta start making cd's. Conversely more albums are created with really bad \"Side B\" tracks since albums are again sold by the cd and not singular tracks - good bye itunes and 0.99 cents single track buying. Blockbuster again becomes relevant as people, still wanting an instant gratification experience by getting their videos \"now\" move blockbuster to reopen locations around the world. Lines are formed around the corner as former \"darknet'ers\" succumb to being in such close proximity to the movies that they formerly traded online and try to get employment. Coversely global warming gasses increase because of all of the cars that now fill blockbuster parking lots - familes weekend blockbuster rental days start again. Its possible the increase's are countered by the electricity no longer needed by all of the servers and equipment that used to make the internet work. Mom and pop video rental stores also experience a upswing. They mainly specialize in pornography because the free access to porn online is no more and Blockbuster, Netflix and Amazon dont do porn. Mom and pops stores are renting porn, causing an outcry by AARP because they feel that the occupation is beneath their values. Mom and pops fight back as they can now afford many of the things that they once could not. People faces start glowing, not by the glow of their smartphones while looking down.....walking down the street....not looking where they are going, but by the joke told to them by someone standing in front of them - LOL is an actual thing and not just something at the end of a text. Landlines start being sold again. The need to be umbilically tied to their phones so they can be updated constantly to facebook and twitter is no more, but since there arent any more voip services, prices increase. The NSA realizes that all of the free information given by folks who were constantly posting all types of questionable and unbelievable information on the web would make all of the computers that they had dedicated to sifting through all of this web created info...useless. Instead of mothballing them they decide to reorganize all of the extra computers and create \"NSATSI\" - The National Security Agency Technologies and Science research institute. With all of the computers now dedicated to science instead of spying, a cure for most cancer's is discovered in a month and plans for a real starship is finally realized. Unfortunatly: Someone at \"NSATSI\" realizes that the technology used to connect all of the computers together could be used to connect different and even distant computers and a new NSATSIconnect net is born.

As the narcissist understands that you are intentionally ignoring them will deflate their inflated ego. Their self-esteem is connected by how much attention they can get from you or others. A person with high levels of narcissism can get more aggressive when being ignored. When they think you are ignoring them, some won\u2019t be able to control their temper, so they may lash out or change their approach by being aggressive with their calls or text messages demanding to talk or communicate with you. They will never be ready to discuss or be accountable for what they did or said to you. They will just expect you to accept what they want or need while they will be very hypocritical by ignoring their actions. Yes, they will be mad or upset at you for ignoring them, but when or once you call them out on their behavior, they will get mad at you, and in return ignore you. Even if you ignore a narcissist for whatever reason that may be, they will eventually get bored and seek attention from someone else. The narcissist may replace you with someone else who won\u2019t ignore them and give them the attention, and control that they seek. This is why ignoring a narcissist should be more about you, and less about them. This is how they operate, and how they satisfy their narcissistic supply. Solution: Ignoring them is one of the easiest ways to redeem your control, regain your sense of clarity, and restore your power by focusing your attention on yourself. As far as what happens to a narcissist when you ignore them is really irrelevant. May you know the signs. May you not become a victim. And may you be more concern about your healing, recovery, and emotional-mental health. If this content was helpful, please consider clicking the upvote button. Thank you!",

They feel narcissistic injury, followed by narcissistic rage; however, take a different approach. The shunned covert narcissist may\u2026Get into a car accidentSustain a physical injuryGo to the emergency department for an illnessFaint at workAttempt suicideGet themselves firedEliminate all hygiene, becoming disheveledOnce they\u2019ve got your attention, they\u2019ll say\u2026What did I ever do to you to be treated this way?How can you be so cruel?I\u2019d never do this to you.This is only part one of their approach. Part two involves crafting overwhelming sympathy for them and hatred for you from their flying monkeys. What happens to YOU when you ignore a narcissist? Once you\u2019ve become truly indifferent, once you are no longer impacted by the narcissist\u2019s drama and chaos, they become much easier to ignore. The changes you\u2019ll notice are vast.You see their behavior so clearly.You think about the narcissist less.You have time for other people, places, and things.You cultivate healthy relationships.You create new healthy habits.You find yourself again.You get clear about where you\u2019re headed.You own your value.You realize you have nothing to prove \u2013 to anyone.You feel whole.You feel at peace.Intention is everything.
