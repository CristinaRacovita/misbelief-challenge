            "I was 13\u201314 when my grandma died. My grandpa lived another 6 years or so beyond that.

He died late winter when we were ages 20\u201324. Once Spring rolled around, we started going through the house, cleaning up stuff to get it ready for being sold. My brother and I were cleaning out his garage, which had lots of storage shelves. On one of them we found a box full of thin paperback books. Dozens of them. They were all erotic stories! He had close to 100 books, many with really kinky titles and stories, like:Billy\u2019s Sister in the ShowerMom loves the Neighbor\u2019s DogMom and Dad, and Uncle JoeCarolyn in the DungeonHelping Aunt CharlotteMandy and the StallionThat\u2019s right, I was faced with the knowledge that my 80 something grandpa read and liked stories about incest, bestiality, and S&M!!! At that moment I wished for some bleach to wash my eyes out. My big brother had the same reaction. There was no way we could let my mom find this out about her dad. Luckily, there was an apartment complex across the street with dumpsters. We tossed the books in one of those to get rid of them. I loved my grandpa, but I could have done without that knowledge in my life! Edited 1/22/17 - I just wanted to clarify a couple things: This happened in the Early 1980\u2019s, my Grandma died in 1977, and based on the situation, there is virtually 0% chance that he was keeping them for a friend. Also, I\u2019m not judging my Grandpa, I\u2019m just saying it was totally unexpected and a shock to see.",

I heard loud sounds coming from my parents\u2019 bedroom in the early morning. Loud sounds were usual in my family, but these captured both my fear and intense curiosity. Curiosity won out. I hesitated at their closed door, but still couldn\u2019t figure out what was happening. When I entered, I saw my parents\u2019 bed pulled apart, bedding everywhere, top mattress upright between my father and mother, sandwiching her to the wall. She was actually hidden from my view, simply a lump, and my father was holding the mattress firmly with one hand, beating at the lump with his free hand. No arguing, no raised voices. Only a small, muffled whimpering coming from between the wall and mattress, and the steady, heavy thumps of my father\u2019s fist. How could I intervene, stop them? I screamed, ran from the room, ran to the basement, which fortunately dead-bolted from the inside, and refused to come out for the day. My mother tried to urge me, saying she was fine, they\u2019d had an argument, it was actually very thoughtful of my father to protect her with the mattress. When I finally emerged, it was as if nothing had happened, as if I had somehow dreamed it, as if two people could never be so horrid and toxic to one another. I was born into arguments, swearing, doors slamming, dinner plates flying because the food wasn\u2019t cooked properly (it had been). This was, to young me, merely how people lived life: \u201cYour father has a temper. We must understand how stressful his job is.\u201d I worked hard for many years to become an incredibly understanding person. They would so often laugh together, debate intelligently together, go to parties and bring us back favors, play records and dance in the front room, and organize audio for theatrical events. Even then, I knew they had frequent, passionate, loud sex \u2026 and it didn\u2019t shock me. Every day I grasped for any evidence of loving in my life. But I had never known such violence was possible. I knew it was light years from loving or understandable. That morning, I learned the truly black abyss that domestic abuse filled and would continue to fill. Almost six decades later, I still cannot remove, from so many ugly memories, that one. I\u2019ve been through ages of therapy, and I turned my life around in ways general statistics suggest would be highly unlikely. I learned to live a healthy, responsible life. I raised a healthy son. I stopped the cycle of abuse. I think of that as a phenomenal personal achievement. But I\u2019d give oceans, worlds, universes to never have seen that surreal moment.",
            "I was in another room, and I overheard my father say to one of his tenants, that because he had only one child, \u201cI wish I had a son instead.\u201d I\u2019m a female, an only child. These words will always remain in the back of my mind. I wish I didn't hear, and even if so, I wish I could forget.",

I had massive exposure to English prior to my move (due to my interests) and I would say my English in general was very good, speaking being the obvious weakness. It took me 2, maybe 3 weeks to adjust and from that point it felt natural to be around my classmates and school friends. I don\u2019t think there was a single moment when I felt uncomfortable due to being Polish. Furthermore, people I only met occasionally often didn\u2019t notice I was Polish. I recently moved to Edinburgh, Scotland. Again, I work in software development and my English is still good. I work remotely from home, so you can imagine I have little exposure to English (which by the way I\u2019m trying to change). What can I say, we have lovely neighbours - all of them either Scotish or English. I haven\u2019t had any problems being Polish despite very distinctive Polish accent. I meet a lot of people from different backgrounds, cultures and everyone, literally everyone is friendly. So, if you ask me, personally, I am very fond of British culture, the way people behave and treat one another. I also love the place I live at, I have chosen to be here remembering how it was to live in UK. If you want a general answer, I would say it depends. I can think of two types of Polish people living in UK. Those who are here with \u201cmake money, go back home\u201d still in their minds - these will probably stick to their Polish friends, rarely make new connections (other than required by their jobs) and try to make their lives here to be as close as their lives back in Poland (by this I mean food, friends, habits, behaviour). Those who live in UK and, just like me, are proud of living here, people enjoying their lives. They feel more British than Polish, they either assimilated or are in process of assimilating with British culture, British people and the way of life that was waiting for them in UK. This may be quite simplified, there are obviously people who falls in-between these two types. The bottom line is - the more we want to be here for reasons other than securing better future back in Poland, the better is our opinion about British people.",

It also make me think that\u2019s the reason why is quite hard to get to know people well. Becuase there is this mask they put on when leave home. I always want to be told when I\u2019m doing something wrong but no, it\u2019s not that easy in this country. Even if you annoy people, they will still smile and pretend they\u2019re your best friend. I had the first experience like this when I started my first job in UK. Most people where genuinely nice and chatty (or so I thought). One of my supervisors was always so friendly and chatty. Later on when my girlfriend was in a staff room during her break (nobody knew she is my girlfriend) she heard the same lovely supervisor talking to her friend something like \u2018\u2019Have you seen this new Polish bloke? Because of this bastard my friend didn\u2019t get this job. They should go back to their fucking country.\u2019\u2019. Later on I went to see general manager of the place and explained what happened. She was really helpful and really gave this lady some hard time. I also confronted the lady herself and said something like \u2018\u2019Thank you so much for those nice words you said in the staff room. I really appreciate how welcoming you are.\u2019\u2019 But that was one of the very few bad situations I\u2019ve came across. Mostly I find Brits polite and always helpful, but quite a few of them don\u2019t know how many pints are too much (especially on Friday evenings). And I found the amount of trust they have in strangers amazing. Like my first day in the UK when I gave my landlord one week worth of rent. And he was perfectly okay with it. That would just never happen in Poland. The next thing about English friends is, if somebody really likes you they will stay friends with you forever. I\u2019m still getting cards from a British lady who went to work in Dubai. And the love for cards. For every occasion. Did you have a birthday? There is a card for it. Are you unwell? Broke? Sad? Happy? Changing jobs? Moving out? Changing car? There is a card for everything. The amount of cards in casual Tescos is just astonishing. The only thing which I find strange (not bad or good) is the surprise when you want to develop. They are so many people that stay in minimum wage jobs for 30+ years. Very often in the same place. I keep developing, improving qualifications, doing my second degree and worked for minimum wage for 28 days. I mean there nothing bad about the fact that somebody doesn\u2019t mind this kind of lifestyle. It perfectly okay. The strange thing is the surprise on everybody faces if you want to pick up some extra shifts to earn some more money, study at the same time, gain some extra qualifications. And it happened in both low end jobs and those 50k+ ones (where you would presume people are more likely to constantly develop). But I generally like British people more than Polish, however bad it may sound. Polish people are a bit to grumpy for me. And love moaning about everything, everywhere. PS I forgot about British love of cars. Doesn\u2019t matter how much money you have, you\u2019ve got to have a better/newer car than your neighbour. Does he have 14\u2032 plate Ford Focus? Just imagine the look on his face when he will see yours, with 17\u2032 plate on it! (it\u2019s completely irrelevant it\u2019s exactly the same car).",

I have, however, lived in the UK for over 10 years and have had numerous comments thrown my way! Someone else said that the British, by and large, like France and the French more than what the French would think - and I think that\u2019s true. French people who haven\u2019t been to Britain probably imagine that the Brits do not particularly like us, seeing that we are rivals (and have been for a long time), that a significant part of British humour is to poke and deride the French, and that our press often gleefully reproduce headlines from the less savoury side of the British press (the Sun etc) that often doesn\u2019t hold back in crudely mocking and disrespecting foreigners. But I think this misconception is due to a very British trait that we do not really understand unless we go and live there for a while: British humour. You see, it is different from French humour. British humour will mock mercilessly what it holds dear. Starting with themselves (the Brits are champions at laughing at themselves). It ensues that if the Brits mock the French, they must somehow like them. But French humour is quite different, we tend to mock things/people that are different from us, or what we consider to be \u201cus\u201d. We love Belgian jokes, we mock the rich if we\u2019re poor and vice-versa, we mock regions other than ours. (we also love wordplay and things like contrepeteries but that is different, the British equivalent would be double-entendre jokes). But anyway, there is not a lot of self-mockery. The best-known and popular British humour in France is not that self-mocking, but rather the absurd humour of the Monty Python. But back to what the Brits think of the French. In my interactions with Brits while living there as the \u201ctoken frog\u201d, beyond the \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkey\u201d and \u201cwhite flag factory\u201d banter, there was quite a lot of things my Brit friends and colleagues liked: the food of course, the wine, the sense of a more \u201cdolce vita\u201d type of life, the natural environment, the architecture, the literature and arts (not modern music though!), the importance of family life, our government-guaranteed protections (health service, welfare, workers rights), the language and the welcome they (usually) get. I thought there was also a sense that in a world with lots of polarisation and ignorance-filled hate, the fact that Brits and Frogs share a lot of common history should mean that we know each other very well, and this familiarity is quite reassuring and should make us allies. The best analogy I can come up with is that the Brits and French are like brothers: squabbling a lot, vying for attention, but often not far from each other, and when the chips are down: united. Well, we have been on the same sides for over 100 years now: quite a long time in our common history! Having said that, I also noticed a few things the Brits genuinely do not like much about France, some of which I agree with, some I don\u2019t: the petty bureaucracy (fair enough), the electrical wiring (fair enough too), the driving (not sure that\u2019s fair but there you go), the lack of orderly queueing (ha!), the beer (OK), the fact that we diss English cheese (of course!), our politicians (OK, but are yours much better?), our tradesmen (I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever fully understand why), our music (of which they usually only know a superficial amount). I probably forget a few things. But we all agreed that it is great that France and Britain are indeed quite different cultures. I for one hope that it remains that way, as the joy of visiting and discovery comes from exploring the differences.",

If we\u2019re being distantly and coldly polite, you\u2019re probably in trouble. And of course, there\u2019s no one we enjoy mocking more than ourselves (except possibly Americans. Bless them, they take themselves so seriously, it\u2019s just far too easy). We love the food, the weather, the culture, the sport (which in the case of football, they nicked from us and had the gall to become better at) and the language. While English is a Germanic language at its roots, a very large chunk of its vocabulary is derived from French. Indeed, almost a quarter of the British population can speak/understand French - and I suspect that a good deal more than that can muddle their way through the basics if they have to. It is by far the most commonly spoken non-English language in the British Isles, far ahead of native languages like Welsh and Scots. Granted, we can\u2019t always speak it very well, but many of us try. In my own experience (I speak competent conversational French, understand a good deal more, and read it quite well, but when I do speak it , I apparently have the most stunningly English accent imaginable), the French are quite understanding of this, and tend to smile kindly, before switching to what is often embarrassingly good English. Important Note: this only tends to happen if you at least try to speak French first. If you don\u2019t, then unless their job depends upon it, they will probably pretend not to understand a word of English. This is one of the things that makes the French contrary little whatsits, which both infuriates us and makes us understand them all the more, because we are also contrary little whatsits. That above point probably sums up our view of the French, really - they annoy the hell out of us, just as we annoy the hell out of them, and both of us enjoy doing so immensely. They\u2019re that friend who gleefully pushes all of your buttons, but who\u2019s also far too much fun to be around (especially because you can push their buttons back). It\u2019s a \u2018can\u2019t live with them, can\u2019t live without them\u2019 sort of situation.",

But, there are no clear rules as to what is considered masculine, feminine, or neutral. So, you need to learn the noun with its corresponding article. You need to memorize them. Some words are clearly masculine (like der Mann - the man), feminine (die Frau - the woman), but neuter (das M\u00e4dchen - the girl). Yes, girl in German is not feminine but neuter. There are rules that each case follows, depending on the gender of the noun.So, you really need to know the genders of the nouns to use them properly in the different cases. German has what are called separate verbs. So, when you are listening to someone speak you need to really pay attention to understand if someone has used a separable verb or not. Many prepositions have different cases depending on the situation. So, for example, a preposition will be used in the dative case in a certain situation, and in the accusative, in other situations. Many prepositions use only one case. Some verbs can only be used in one case, as well. Example:  Ich gehe ins Kino (I am going to the cinema or I go to the cinema), accusative case, preposition: in. Ich bin in dem Kino (I am at the cinema), dative case, preposition: in. The word Kino is a neuter word: das Kino.In the accusative, the neuter nouns use the das article. So, Ich gehe in das Kino. But, in das can be shortened as ins, so you get: Ich gehe ins Kino.In the dative case, the neuter nouns use the dem article. So, Ich bin in dem Kino. But, in dem can be shortened to im, and you get: Ich bin im Kino. Another example:  Ich gehe in die Schule (I go to school or I am going to school), accusative case, preposition: in. Schule is a feminine noun: die Schule. In the accusative case, feminine nouns use the die article, so you say: Ich gehe in die Schule.Ich bin in der Schule (I am in school), dative case, preposition: in. Schule is a feminine noun: die Schule. In the dative case, feminine nouns use the der article: Ich bin in der Schule. The above examples show why you need to know the gender of the nouns.If you do not know the genders, you won't be able to use the cases properly, and hence, won't be able to speak properly. Another aspect is word order. Verbs are used in the second position in the sentence: Ich lese ein Buch (I read a book or I am reading a book.), the verb lesen is on the second position. But, have a look at this one: Aber, es ist nicht m\u00f6glich (But it is not possible), appears to have the verb ist in the third position, but the word Aber takes position zero, es position 1, ist position 2, and the rule is met. German has many prepositions. If you combine the same verb with two different prepositions, you create two different verbs. For example: anmachen (to switch on), zumachen (to close), prepositions: an, zu; verb: machen. So, you need to know the prepositions and how combining them with verbs changes the verb completely. Prepositions are quite hard to understand because when translated, they have many different meanings. They normally cannot be translated to a single meaning.  The preposition von can mean from, of. The preposition auf can mean from: Ich komme auf Mallorca (I come from Mallorca), but it can mean on: Der Teller liegt auf dem Tisch (The plate lies on the table.) Some prepositions can only be used with a particular case: mit (with) can only be used in the dative case. The preposition f\u00fcr (for) can only be used with the accusative case. So, there are many aspects that make the German language difficult.I've just written about a few of them. I hope this helps.",

Strong verbs involve changes in the vowel of the verb root, while weak verbs involve tacking on an ending. These vowel changes can be divided into classes, but they're not obviously systematic or regular. Examples: German singen --> sang --> gesungen, English sing --> sang --> sung.Weak verbs with a dental ending (that is, -d or -t). This is from a very reduced form of the verb 'do', and is attested from the earliest written samples of Anglo-Saxon and Gothic.Plural forms in certain noun classes involving umlaut --- a type of vowel change conditioned by following vowels. In most Germanic languages, the only kind of umlaut is 'i-umlaut'; that is, back vowels get fronted because the plural ending was historically an -i or something similar. Hence, German Fu\u00df --> F\u00fc\u00dfe, English foot --> feet, and Swedish fot --> f\u00f6tter. Some of the Scandinavian languages have more umlaut categories, including u-umlaut (involving a rounding of the stem vowel), like in Icelandic \u00e9g talar --> vi\u00f0 t\u00f6lum ('a' changes to '\u00f6' in the plural stem due to the presence of the 'u' in the second syllable).Question formation through shifts in word order. German du hast gesehen --> hast du gesehen?, English you are here --> are you here? Though English is kind of strange, since it added on 'do-support' at some stage in its history, but even still, shows the same shifts in word order: you did see --> did you see?Large vowel inventories, typically including a full set of front and back vowels with at least three (and usually four) height distinctions, plus in most Germanic languages, front rounded vowels (with English once again as the exception). My dialect of English has at least thirteen vowels. German has fifteen. Swedish has somewhere around eighteen.A three-gender system in nouns, adjectives, and pronouns (masculine, feminine, and neuter). However, in most of the mainland Scandinavian languages, this has collapsed into a common-neuter distinction, because the masculine and feminine are no longer distinguished in nouns (but still are in pronouns). Icelandic still distinguishes all three, and some dialects of Danish still do (perhaps under German influence?). As far as I am aware, all Germanic languages still distinguish masculine, feminine, and neuter in personal pronouns.The word for 'bear' is derived from a taboo alteration meaning 'the brown one', while in many other Indo-European languages, it is either derived from the Indo-European root word (something like that which gave Greek arktos) or a word meaning something like 'honey-eater' (hence Russian medved).",

Hillbilly Elegy My grandfather used to say that you could tell an intelligent person by their sense of humor - regardless of formal education. It requires intelligence to banter or make a witty comment. You can\u2019t banter with someone who is not quick - it\u2019s like throwing a super ball against a mattress. Throughout time, women have valued a sense of humor in selecting partners because it is a subliminal cue that someone is intelligent. Humor is just one trait. Other noticeable traits of an intelligent person might be the ability to express themselves, recall, alertness and curiosity\u2026. Some people leave an impression of intelligence that you form just by looking in their eyes (their eyes seem to have an alertness or sparkle that suggests intelligence). As an example, I recently exchanged quips very briefly (30 seconds) with an elderly man, probably in his 80s, at a coffee shop. My impression that he was smart was confirmed when I overheard one of the women at his table mention that he had been a full admiral (3 stars) prior to his retirement. So, even in casual conversation we often quickly form a sense about someone\u2019s intelligence. I also have learned not to measure intelligence by academic credentials. Some very intelligent people, by choice, culture, or circumstance, did not go to college or went to a lower ranked college. They may be just as intelligent (or maybe more intelligent) as others who have Ph.Ds from prestigious schools. Your friend who makes a witty remark or that didn\u2019t go to college, but always crushes you in chess, may be very intelligent. I have encountered sharp people who are self conscious of the fact that they don\u2019t have a college degree - don\u2019t worry about it. I have come to understand that many people in the U.S. from other countries, who are very intelligent, may struggle to express themselves because they do not speak or comprehend English well (imagine how depressing it would be if you are very articulate in another language, but can\u2019t communicate your thoughts in English). You should not conclude that their lack of fluency or current position reflects their intelligence. Countless times I\u2019ve run into highly educated people who were forced to give up their careers only to accept menial jobs when they moved to the U.S. Or, people may have an illness or disability that masks their intelligence during brief encounters. Wealth also is not necessarily correlated with intelligence. I have met wealthy people that are not intelligent, who have reptilian greed or that inherited their wealth. I also know many highly intelligent people who have made life choices and pursued careers that are not lucrative. One academic is said to have met with a Wall Street executive who contemptuously said: \u201cIf you\u2019re so smart, why aren\u2019t you wealthy?\u201d The professor replied: \u201cYou\u2019re very wealthy, why aren\u2019t you smart?\u201d Note: I have been around very smart people (at least top 10% - many top 1%) all of my professional career. Some are introverts and some are extroverts, and most have at least reasonable social skills or they would not be successful. I would discount any of the answers which suggest that the cast of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d is the norm. And, since the question relates only to \u201cabove average\u201d intelligence, I would imagine that includes the diversity found in hundreds of thousands of screaming alumni and students at college football stadiums every Saturday in the Fall. One other important note: intelligence is just one characteristic of a person. They may have others, like kindness, loyalty, or empathy that make them a great partner, friend, parent or child\u2026.. Finally, a person can be very intelligent, but not a good leader or wise.",

I've lived in the US for 15 years and worked as a dentist in the US for 3 years. I've seen a lot of mouths. To me, British teeth are inexplicable, considering how the UK is a happy, healthy and wealthy place. The British are often (note how I don't say always) vain about their clothes, hair, house, their neighbourhood, the cut of their suit, the shoes they wear, their job their partners... just like most other people, including those in the USA. However, there is an exception to this vanity in many British over 30's:Teeth. I get tired of hearing / reading how British people have 'healthy teeth' based on a cursory glance by an untrained observer. These are not data. Even my opinion isn't peer-reviewed published data - it's just the disinterested observation by a dual citizen. US patients are highly varied. More so than in the UK where anyone with modest motivation can see a NHS dentist by using the NHS website (a very polished and effective site). The US has vast income and wealth disparity, more so than the uk, but without broad access to basic care like in the UK. 50% of the US population doesn't see a dentist regularly. Many have limited access (not really an issue in the UK as mentioned). There is a misconception by many who claim to be British online that 'all Americans (US citizens presumably, not all people living on the continent of America) have white / large teeth'. *Sighs* The USA is largely populated by Europeans. The gene pool is quite similar. I assure you in all the text books I've read about dentistry in the past 10 years I've NEVER read that the US population has larger teeth. Whiter? Perhaps. Whitening treatments are fairly popular as they work very well and I've never heard someone say they regret getting their teeth whitened. Also smoking is notably less common in the US, especially amongst educated urbanites and suburbanites (read:those who actually go to the dentist regularly). Furthermore, tea drinking is far less common in the US. Tea is my favourite drink, but it really stains badly. Just try leaving a cup of tea and coffee out overnight and try to clean them the next morning. The tea cup will need an abrasive pad, while coffee's stains wipe of with a finger. Lastly, I've had my British parents as patients. My patents used to swear by their dentist whom they visited every 6 months for decades. I found no less than 4 sites of open decay ('caries') in my mother's mouth. She also had a crown placed over a dead tooth that was cracked, infected and had terrible margins (read: shoddy work that'd get you an F in dental school). I spent days clearing up her 'healthy' mouth and now she is disease free... with a whiter, more youthful smile to boot. Actually, it was a pleasure to be able to help my mum in this way. Interestingly, before I treated her I sent her back to the UK with a note outlining those 4 undiagnosed problems. After a consultation with her UK dentist she was told \"American (Sic.) Dentists tend to over-treat\". Decay is by far the most obvious disease that dentists treat (that and periodontal disease). For him to describe removing decay and clearing infected root canals as over treating was akin to an oncologist saying \"it's just cancer, best not to over-treat\". Absurd. If you are OK ignoring the poorest US citizens who don't have access to care, then yes, the US clearly has healthier mouths. Also, fewer missing teeth. Also straighter teeth (not just a cosmetic issue, BTW ) and whiter teeth. It seems the younger British have adopted US attitudes to their teeth. Every time I go back their teeth look better. I'm happy to see the change.",

If you fluoridate the water, the kids don\u2019t develop cavities. I had a college roommate who grew up in an area which had naturally fluoridated water, and he had never had a cavity. My wife grew up in a city which fluoridated its water and hardly ever had any had any cavities either. I grew up with non-fluoridated water and most of my teeth developed cavities.Dental plans. All these kids had parents who had dental plans provided by their employers. It was a standard perquisite that all employers offered. Every six months they took their kids to the dentist, and if there were any problems, the dentist fixed them. If their teeth came in crooked, the dentist straightened them before the problem became serious. The result - perfect straight teeth. All paid for by the employer.Diet. This is a bit arcane, but before the invention of agriculture, nobody had cavities. Our paleolithic ancestors never had cavities because they never ate anything that caused them. Scientists can tell when agriculture was introduced to an area by examining the teeth of bodies in graveyards. In looking at the teeth of corpses from ancient shipwrecks, only the officers on the ships had cavities, and the crew members had much better teeth because they couldn\u2019t afford to buy sugar. Our diet is too high in sugar and other cavity causing foods.So, there is nothing to prevent the British from having perfect teeth except their abysmal diets and apparently their lack of dental plans. Also, it would be a good idea to fluoridate all their water supplies. Some people may disagree with the latter point, but I have a degree in Chemistry and can go on about this topic at considerable length.",

I think they do because they\u2019re not good at English and don\u2019t want to be embarrassed. They do not have the confidence to talk English because they know they do so many mistakes and have too much pride to begin a conversation they don\u2019t feel comfortable with. They should understand you improve your level \u2026 by practicing. However, my friends who talk a good English are pleased to talk this language. The truth is, in France, not a lot of people can talk a correct English (even people who did long studies) so they feel intimidated because they don\u2019t understand everything, and are not able to say everything they want to say. So it might seem French people are rude and don\u2019t want to talk English \u2026 but not all of them obviously!! I\u2019ve met someone at a party, he was Finnish and didn\u2019t know how to speak French, I talked with him some time (in English), and a lot of my friends approached us to talk during this time \u2026 but when they heard we were talking English, they just left. I thought that was crazy and realized how French people can seem inconsiderate. However, I think that French people should understand that English is necessary in the business world, I had many jobs in my life (even if I\u2019m still young) and 3/4 of these jobs, I could never have done them if I didn\u2019t know how to speak English. It\u2019s also a good way to make friends because not a lot of international people can talk French, but most of them can talk English!! Hope this will be useful. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask question if you want to know more about French people\u2019s habits.",

Despite I use this english language everyday through my expat life,I really cant stand it. First, french people are very Cartesian and need to explain more deeply, we need to avoid ambiguity and being able to explain things clearly. The fact that a huge amount of common words in English can be used as noun and verb, is sometimes tricky for us. We love long explanation, and in some ways, the English language is too efficient. So it is easy to use, but it has a huge lack of \u201cje ne sais quoi\u201d special taste. Even I speak english, I may be the type of person wanting to write long sentences to say nothing more than a native will do with only three words. This logic may also be the difference you can find between native speakers from Europe and native speakers from America (especially the one used in the west of the USA and Canada), I often find the English used in Europe is more dense. As living in China, chinese is also a language in which you can use the minimum of words that you need to be understood. From what I have experience lot of asian american in California tend to minimize compare to the european speakers. Secondly, \u201cEnglish is bad pronounced French\u201d as Clemenceau said. For most European using Latin alphabet a A is pronounced A or sometimes something else if it is next to a vowel or some specific letters. English complain about languages using genders and silent letters, of course I agree with the fact that \u201cun oeil, des yeux\u201d is complicated and that pronouncing \u201ceau\u201d-> O is not logic. But english native often forgot at which point the way they pronounce things is totally strange and bizarre. But this can stand for most of other languages speaker. Remind that the writing of French and the speaking are very far from each other, but it is a non tonal (or same-position tonal language). Some french can find accentuation sexy, especially in songs, the use of tons are not something they understand well. So they won\u2019t be able to master it easily and they may not like the move of an english speaker mouth. From my point of view, italian, russian and japanese are much lovely to hear than english. An english speech look like someone is surprised of something and try to breath as explaining the things at the same time. I do prefer the british accent, because the american looks like the speaker do not care about what he said. Thirdly, English is easy accessible so it becoming the language of the easy ones. So it look like very rude towards the english literature, but this one is more specific with the use of English as lingua franca. A lot of French are jealous about the domination of English language as the international language. As me, they will always explain that english power is just the result of 3\u20134 really bad strategic move from France during the last centuries, and that there is no natural reason why english is the international language. And at the same time, a lot of us won\u2019t be ready to listen to someone pretending mastering french with a huge foreigner accent. Most of the english speakers from UK and other native countries may be more tolerant than the French even mocking the Belgians and the Swiss. So everybody can learn English and hold english as their own. Texans, Scottish, Singaporeans, Filipinos, Aussies they all don\u2019t speak the english from London. Nowadays French people are more tolerant with speakers from Quebec and Africa for example, but it is still very hard for people in France to accept other accent. I have a lot of friends within the Francophone world, I of course understand them totally. But when I come back metropolitan France, I am chocked to see that the main french TV channels put subtitles on native speakers from our overseas territories. It is one of the stupidest things french are able of. As I said at the beginning, french hate most of the foreigner language. Most of the hate towards in english is primary because it is dominant. So French are jealous, and because they are all forced to learn it at school, you will hear more french complaining about english than against any other one. If you look deep in the grammar system, the easiness of english is not seen as beauty among french people. Plus the fact that the pronunciation may be less cute than other foreigner languages."

I've lived in the US for 15 years and worked as a dentist in the US for 3 years. I've seen a lot of mouths. To me, British teeth are inexplicable, considering how the UK is a happy, healthy and wealthy place. The British are often (note how I don't say always) vain about their clothes, hair, house, their neighbourhood, the cut of their suit, the shoes they wear, their job their partners... just like most other people, including those in the USA. However, there is an exception to this vanity in many British over 30's:Teeth. I get tired of hearing / reading how British people have 'healthy teeth' based on a cursory glance by an untrained observer. These are not data. Even my opinion isn't peer-reviewed published data - it's just the disinterested observation by a dual citizen. US patients are highly varied. More so than in the UK where anyone with modest motivation can see a NHS dentist by using the NHS website (a very polished and effective site). The US has vast income and wealth disparity, more so than the uk, but without broad access to basic care like in the UK. 50% of the US population doesn't see a dentist regularly. Many have limited access (not really an issue in the UK as mentioned). There is a misconception by many who claim to be British online that 'all Americans (US citizens presumably, not all people living on the continent of America) have white / large teeth'. *Sighs* The USA is largely populated by Europeans. The gene pool is quite similar. I assure you in all the text books I've read about dentistry in the past 10 years I've NEVER read that the US population has larger teeth. Whiter? Perhaps. Whitening treatments are fairly popular as they work very well and I've never heard someone say they regret getting their teeth whitened. Also smoking is notably less common in the US, especially amongst educated urbanites and suburbanites (read:those who actually go to the dentist regularly). Furthermore, tea drinking is far less common in the US. Tea is my favourite drink, but it really stains badly. Just try leaving a cup of tea and coffee out overnight and try to clean them the next morning. The tea cup will need an abrasive pad, while coffee's stains wipe of with a finger. Lastly, I've had my British parents as patients. My patents used to swear by their dentist whom they visited every 6 months for decades. I found no less than 4 sites of open decay ('caries') in my mother's mouth. She also had a crown placed over a dead tooth that was cracked, infected and had terrible margins (read: shoddy work that'd get you an F in dental school). I spent days clearing up her 'healthy' mouth and now she is disease free... with a whiter, more youthful smile to boot. Actually, it was a pleasure to be able to help my mum in this way. Interestingly, before I treated her I sent her back to the UK with a note outlining those 4 undiagnosed problems. After a consultation with her UK dentist she was told \"American (Sic.) Dentists tend to over-treat\". Decay is by far the most obvious disease that dentists treat (that and periodontal disease). For him to describe removing decay and clearing infected root canals as over treating was akin to an oncologist saying \"it's just cancer, best not to over-treat\". Absurd. If you are OK ignoring the poorest US citizens who don't have access to care, then yes, the US clearly has healthier mouths. Also, fewer missing teeth. Also straighter teeth (not just a cosmetic issue, BTW ) and whiter teeth. It seems the younger British have adopted US attitudes to their teeth. Every time I go back their teeth look better. I'm happy to see the change.",

If you fluoridate the water, the kids don\u2019t develop cavities. I had a college roommate who grew up in an area which had naturally fluoridated water, and he had never had a cavity. My wife grew up in a city which fluoridated its water and hardly ever had any had any cavities either. I grew up with non-fluoridated water and most of my teeth developed cavities.Dental plans. All these kids had parents who had dental plans provided by their employers. It was a standard perquisite that all employers offered. Every six months they took their kids to the dentist, and if there were any problems, the dentist fixed them. If their teeth came in crooked, the dentist straightened them before the problem became serious. The result - perfect straight teeth. All paid for by the employer.Diet. This is a bit arcane, but before the invention of agriculture, nobody had cavities. Our paleolithic ancestors never had cavities because they never ate anything that caused them. Scientists can tell when agriculture was introduced to an area by examining the teeth of bodies in graveyards. In looking at the teeth of corpses from ancient shipwrecks, only the officers on the ships had cavities, and the crew members had much better teeth because they couldn\u2019t afford to buy sugar. Our diet is too high in sugar and other cavity causing foods.So, there is nothing to prevent the British from having perfect teeth except their abysmal diets and apparently their lack of dental plans. Also, it would be a good idea to fluoridate all their water supplies. Some people may disagree with the latter point, but I have a degree in Chemistry and can go on about this topic at considerable length.",

It's a subject that has been beaten to death by comedians, perpetuated in pop culture, and even believed by some misinformed souls. But let's dive into this dental enigma and unravel the truth, shall we? Firstly, it's important to note that generalizing an entire population based on their dental health is not only unfair but also quite inaccurate. The idea that British white people have uniformly bad teeth is a gross oversimplification and perpetuates an unfounded stereotype. Now, if we were to explore the origins of this stereotype, we can find a few factors that may have contributed to its development. Historically, dental hygiene practices were not as advanced as they are today, and this was not exclusive to the British Isles. Dental care, in general, has evolved significantly over time, and modern dental practices have greatly improved oral health worldwide. It's also worth mentioning that British cuisine has traditionally involved a fair share of sugary treats and starchy foods. The consumption of these items, coupled with inadequate oral hygiene practices, could potentially contribute to dental issues. However, it is important to emphasize that this is not unique to the British population. Many cultures around the world have traditional diets that may impact dental health. In recent decades, the dental health of the British population has significantly improved. Public awareness campaigns, advancements in dental technology, and a greater emphasis on oral hygiene have all contributed to a positive change in dental health across the country. Moreover, it's crucial to understand that personal choices and socioeconomic factors play a significant role in an individual's dental health. Factors such as access to dental care, education on oral hygiene, and even genetic predisposition can affect the condition of one's teeth. These factors are not exclusive to any specific racial or ethnic group but are universal concerns. Now, let's address the satire element of this response. Stereotypes, no matter how prevalent or humorous they may se..."

I think I\u2019m qualified to share some thoughts, especially a young immigrant Chinese view. Being Chinese in New Zealand allows me to perceive all things with two different cultures, systems, mindset etc. Furthermore, build my independent critical thinking. I often felt China and New Zealand are the two extremes in country spectrum by many aspects. Huge population VS small population, complicated geographical politics VS island geographic, HARD mode VS EASY lifestyle, rich entertainments VS various sports etc\u2026 it\u2019s exciting to experience these differences from inner to outside. For an instance, I never bought in all Chinese media and nor just believe in western media, especially on China topics. When I argue with an English-speaking native, I am able to identify the bias and truth in comparison . I came to understand better for everything behind what\u2019s going on and this motivates me to keep open and learning on both. This is a dual identity which I accept and enjoy for now. The confusionism rooted in my heart on co-existence and harmony led me to embrace this dual culture and evolve in a healthy way. In reality, I have disadvantage in English proficiency compared to local kiwis and thus have less opportunities in career. But thanks to Chinese tradition on investment in education, I am seeking new pathway by the intelligence advantage , for example mathematical capacity. Not to mention other my personal attributes in hard working, determination. In life, my Chinese appearance is standing out in any circumstances and I am still in the process of integrating into New Zealand. I found many Chinese are prone to live in Chinese community: just shopping in Asian super market, working for Chinese employers, using Chinese social media , hanging with Chinese people and most time speak mandarin. I did some among above, but I don\u2019t appreciate this way. I think it\u2019s Chinese group isolate themselves in comfort zone and never grow. What\u2019s the point of living in new country then? In this way, I am trying to learn more about New Zealand, like Maori history and culture, British-colonized impact, New Zealand lifestyle, and would like to get involved with community service to contribute to the society. Btw, I love playing Touch Rugby and did a lot in promoting such great sports to Chinese. I chose to live in New Zealand more for future and for personal reason. It doesn\u2019t mean I deny my origin or give up home country. Instead, I know where I come from, I know where I am going. I am happy who I am now.",
            "I am an Australian born Chinese, and I have studied and lived in this country for my entire life.

Life in Australia feels quite \u2018normal.\u2019 I\u2019ve never felt discriminated by my peers, with only some occasional stereotypical jokes. Since I grew up and was educated in Australia, I am proficient in English. I do not suffer from having an accent problem like many other Chinese immigrants. I celebrate both Australian and Chinese festivals. When I was growing up, being an Asian wasn\u2019t very common. In a standard Australian class of roughly 25 kids, there were only 3 Asians. Nowadays, I am starting to see more and more Asians and non-caucasian people in those classes. Australia is a very multicultural country, so you won\u2019t feel like you\u2019re a minority living here. Thanks to my Chinese ancestors who came here during the gold rush, there are Chinatowns across all major Australian cities so if you ever felt out of place, you\u2019d know there\u2019s always a place filled with people like you. In primary school, every couple of weeks we\u2019ll have an assembly where students from all year levels gather together. During the assembly, we all sing the national anthem and there\u2019s always someone making a statement of the nation. The statement is about how the land we live on originally belongs to the Aboriginal people and that nobody owns it. During lessons, we are often taught about Australian values such as Harmony and Excellence. This trend will continue on with your secondary education/college. For some reason, I prefer to hang out with other Chinese people. I guess due to our similar Chinese background, we can relate with each other more closely. I think it\u2019s in my genes as the Han Chinese is a homogeneous culture. Chinese loves to gather in group or at least share bonds with the other Chinese around, hence why our families always gather during New Year. However, that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t make friends with non-Chinese people. I have other friends from across many different cultural backgrounds, and we all identify as being Australian. Recently, there\u2019s been a slight growth in the anti-immigration sentiment (usually aimed at Chinese) thanks to our media. In big cities such as Melbourne and Sydney, there\u2019s some negativity towards Chinese because of wealthy Chinese from China who are buying up Australia\u2019s houses. A few years ago, the anti-Chinese sentiment was stronger due to the baby powder incident (where wealthy Chinese are seen buying up shelves of baby powders) and \u201ctaking all the jobs\u201d scare. This saddens me since the Chinese and English people have co-existed on this land for hundreds of years. The Chinese arrived in Australia en masse during the Victorian era due to the gold rush. Our Chinese ancestors were here for a very long time, even before the Federation of Australia. Chinese people also contributed to the foundation of our young nation equally, and I don\u2019t think we deserve discrimination and to be kicked out of the country (like some right-wing people have suggested). If you want to kick us out, then we should also take back all our contributions to this nation since 1818, when the first Chinese immigrant Mak Sai Ying arrived. However, overall, Australia is a very friendly and safe country. There\u2019s rarely an issue as a Chinese living in Australia. Ethnic issues are not exclusive in Australia, and the actual chances of you being discriminated are very rare. I really love Australia, Australia is my home. I just really hope there\u2019s no serious conflict between Australia and China since Australia is my motherland and China is my ancestral land.",

            "I\u2019m not an Australian Chinese person, but I studied and lived in Australia for a bit and also made several first generation immigrant Australian-born Chinese (AuBC) friends whose families were originally from Singapore/Malaysia/South China.

Things are quite similar to the United States in that regard. So, if you\u2019re Australian and just \u2018happen\u2019 to be Chinese while fitting in everywhere else, you usually won\u2019t face many problems except from racist types. Places like Melbourne and Sydney are very multicultural and liberal and don\u2019t take kindly to racist sorts (outlined by Dos Apichart below). My Chinese friends (and myself) faced unique discrimination experiences particularly linked to us being mistaken for Vietnamese, especially during ANZAC Day celebrations. Regular discrimination\u2019s always there, though, with gook being thrown easily as an all-encompassing, nasty insult for all East/Southeast Asians \u2013 but mostly at night and preferably, for the people making the slur, made while they\u2019re hopping onto a train and you\u2019re still on the platform. Yeah, we heard you, bogans! In the diverse, multicultural cities such as Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney, there\u2019re usually fewer instances of harassment for being Chinese \u2013 and again, even fewer if you\u2019re an eloquent English speaker and have a native English accent (be it English, American, Australian, Kiwi, etc). They still occur, just not as frequently. Other than the general growing anti-immigration sentiment (thanks, fearmongerers under the Tony Abbott administration) \u2013 there\u2019s also a lot of simmering negativity about the influx of wealthy Chinese buyers snapping up properties all over Australia and messing up the property market there. This blanket negativity is then extended towards Chinese people in general, be they Australians, tourists, expats or students. I mean, if we equated all the rowdy types in Bali who just happened to have Australian passports to all Australians, that\u2019s rather pointless\u2026 Markers of how you dress are noted as well \u2013 it\u2019s easy to differentiate between the well-dressed locals / expats and tourists from mainland China, with the latter being even more unwelcome in Australia due to what I outlined above with the property issue. (And if they\u2019re poorly-mannered, dickish mainland Chinese tourists, they give the entire demographic a bad name.)",

In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn\u2019t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don\u2019t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It\u2019s also tough to put your writing out there when you\u2019re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you\u2019re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance, Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way.Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly\u2019s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as \u201con\u201d instead of \u201cin\u201d), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers. Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium, speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag \u201cfalse friends,\u201d or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one\u2019s primary language but don\u2019t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium\u2019s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar.

With both brides and grooms getting wedding money from the guest to cover the costs of the wedding. But fear not as husbands will ask for wedding money from the parents and then arrangements are made from there. Many opt for the Western style wedding while some prefer to do both Korean and Western wedding. The Korean one can take a lot longer. One time I was at a wedding hall with automated chandeliers that dropped as the husband and bride went down the aisle. You can donate money and often times there will be a buffet reception area where all the guest can mingle.You can actually sit down and eat at a convenience store in Korea.These are some of the more obscure service based perks.How about retail?Fast Food chains often run out of ingredients and it makes purchasing certain items impossible.Pajeon (\ud30c\uc804) is traditionally eaten on a rainy day. It is like a round dinner pancake and the ingredients are blends of vegetable and flour. My favorite Korean food is Haemul Pajyeon (\ud574\ubb3c\ud30c\uc804) which is Seafood PanjyeonActually most of the kimchi is imported from China. (If there are any doubts regarding this, please see side note #3)Korea (as it has been brought to my light) is actually very protective towards it\u2019s rice industry and has only opened and lifted tariffs towards it in 2017. As for why Kimbap Heaven uses U.S. made white rice, remains a mystery to me. Someone pointed out to me that this could perhaps be certain blends of flour.You can buy a certain amount of things and get one extra item free (1+1 purchases). It happens more frequently than in America.Alcohol is often used as a free sample.Now let\u2019s talk about rent.Real estate is extremely high with house purchases being nothing for of 6 figures for a 2 bedroom condo. Houses are often sold by the room and usually doesn\u2019t come with land.Pyeong is a unit a measurement for an apartment. People are starting to forget pyeong though. Square meters width is how most real estate agents are starting to rent apartments. I still ask how many pyeong as it is easier for me to use.Rental Cars can be done with an international driver\u2019s license. Contrary to popular belief, you can take an English test to get your Korean license.Many apartments may have a western toilet, but subway stations have the eastern one. Those are one of those sit down and squat toilets. In regards to apartment toilets, I\u2019d check with friends to see if it is okay to put toilet paper in the toilet as many of the bathroom\u2019s plumbing are weak and it might back them up. Usually there will be a tissue for the trash bins. Upper class apartments often have bidets which are toilets with remotes to clean your hindquarters. This is not to confuse with the French bidet which is a type of sink. (Note: use with caution!)One room rentals often require a couple thousand to make a rental deposit for rent. In Korean won, that would be a couple million. I paid 3 million for my one room. On average it is 5~10 million won (5~10 thousand dollars (depending on the strength of the SKW))A lot of Korean young adults don\u2019t pay rent. Some have to get married first to have permission to leave their family\u2019s house. It used to be the norm that many could not leave the house until married, but recent times has changed that and times have changed since I first got here. Currently, 30% of families allow their children to stay at home. When I first arrive this was closer to 50%, but when compared to the rest of the world, 30% is still a large percentage. Why adults in different parts of the globe live at home with their parentsYou can rent movies in a DVD room. Just so we\u2019re clear: other things sometimes happens in the DVD room. I guess that was vague\u2026Library books are generally checked out for 2 weeks. But if you didn\u2019t like that fact, then you can always rent Manga in a Manga cafe (\ub9cc\ud654\uce74\ud398)for a few hours.People who do not want to rent a room to study will often go to coffee shops and hang out there all day. They are ideal for the group presentation job interviews (because sometimes companies carry out mass job interviews in Korea). On the other side, I had one job interview with 7 elementary teachers, but luckily that was a fun one. Open spaces and Wi-fi is a bit more comforting after all.Everyone wants to hear about singing rooms right? Well there are basically 2 types: a Noraebang room or a coin singing room. If you have a mass group obviously you need Noraebang room basically you \u201crent\u201d time on the machine and if you sing well or the atmosphere is lively, you may get a time extension. If it is a slow business day, it isn\u2019t unheard of to get 2,3, or 4 time extensions. With coin singing boxes you pay 500 won per song (giver or take a discount). I sometimes will get more songs for paying with paper money in large denominations.Eating out can be quite the adventure. Let\u2019s drop some knowledge about the fast food restaurant scene.When you want to order food, there is sometimes an electric bell attached the table. You press it and within seconds you will get food.Delivery is the best in the world here. Pedal drivers will respond to computer apps or cellphones within 5 minutes (sometimes 10 if they are a smaller chain). While there are no delivery tips, you can pay a \u201cdelivery service charge.)Even though it is considered unsafe the Pedal drivers actually drive their autobikes on the sidewalk for the sake of delivering the food on time.Pizza chains offer a discount on picking up the food in person.Coffee shops dominate the market here. You\u2019d be hard pressed not to find the \u201cperfect cup of coffee.\u201dLike Japan, Korea services up hot or cold canned coffee from convenience stores.If you are a regular and use proper honorifics, generally there will be extra food given for free. This may not apply to younger managed stores.Speaking of free, the best way to save money and get a decent level of nutrition while eating out is to go to Kimbap Cheonguk (a kimbap place in Korea \u201c\uae40\ubc25\ucc9c\uad6d\u201dIn restaurants, there are these little boxes and steel cups. You may wonder what they could be for if you are fresh off the boat/plane. Well, they are actually storage places for chopsticks and napkins, so when you order something you should open them, take out some chopsticks and you can use the napkin for sanitation but it\u2019s actually not for that. Napkins are there so you can wipe your mouth.Here\u2019s something mind blowing: Koreans eat with metal chopsticks and a spoon. For me, I eat my chopsticks left-handed and the spoon in my right. Okay, it\u2019s not really mind blowing, but Japan mainly uses lacquered chopsticks and China uses wooden ones.There is a parody of Fantastic Baby by Big Bang Called Fantastic Chicken. (As a side note you will be made painfully aware at the similarities of \u201cchicken\u201d and \u201ckitchen.\u201d (Please no negativity over this one. I wrote it pre-scandal.)There is a pizza chain called Pizza School. It has thematic pizza. Call it the UN gathering on pizza on the cheap. Corn and sweet potato is often put on pizzas here. For newbies of their menu, I suggest the Mexican Pizza or German Pizza. If country themed pizza not your thing, you can get a pepperoni for about 6,000~7,000 won.There are meat buffets. You can stack mountains of protein on the cheap too. The restaurant chain is known as the Chak-han Dweji (\ucc29\ud55c \ub3fc\uc9c0)(The Kind Pig).There are academies that will collaborate together with restaurants to provide discounts and stipends for their students. Fitness Centers like SpoAny do this, too!Kimbap Cheonguk and Hansot are seen as the \u201cworking man\u2019s place\u201d to get a meal quickly for work.There are special types of burgers called rice burgers. The bread is simply replaced with rice patties. Unfortunately, that means you cannot hold the burger by the bread, but you can still enjoy the difference in taste.There are mandatory Sundays off in certain fast food and retail industries.You can often buy couples sets meals.You can also buy 100 day anniversary and 1000 day anniversary cakes. Yes, love is measured by the day here. So you are literally loved more with \u201ceach passing day.\u201d Just don\u2019t forget the 100th day. That may cause a break-up.Meals items are seriously limited by a few items. You will be hard pressed to find a restaurant with more 20 or 30 menu items. This is perhaps due to not using as many preservatives so organic food must be thrown out after awhile or maybe the palette is limited by the tastes the Korean customers have. However, in actuality many restaurants do indeed have an extended menu called \u201chidden menus.\u201d And no, there\u2019s are not to be confused with specials. They are their own thing that everybody except you knows about! ;)Mom\u2019s Touch is a popular restaurant in Korea. Why is it popular you ask? One reason is that they have chicken burgers. Another reason is that it doubles as Konglish slang for what mom will do when a child gets a bad grade.They have thematic cafes in Korea. I recently went to an English cafe where you get discounts for speaking English. But that\u2019s not all. They have cat cafes, archery cafes (yes, you heard right!), retro cafes, PC cafes and manga cafes. Want to read manga but don\u2019t want it to accumulate in your house? Hit up a Manga cafe.Lotteria is the biggest fast food chain in Korea. I heard it is actually owned by Korean and Japanese joint investors.The number 4 is considered unlucky. Move on to the next number because 44 is twice as unlucky. Ok, you made it this far so I guess I should tell you that \u201cSa\u201d is also a homonym for \u201c4\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d and that is why it is unlucky.On the KTX there are arcades and cafes you can order drinks from and play games. (Yes, I play video games in my not so ample spare time.)I felt like continuing with gaming for a bit. As you all know Korea has a gaming culture unique to the rest of the world with some e-sports teams contributing to the scene, but the majority of such games are not usually broadcasted for streaming on Youtube. They are broadcasted on Naver and Afreeca TV. Google is your friend on the latter.There are Playstation cafes in Korea. But don\u2019t expect the selection to be numerous as many Korean flock to games like Diablo, Overwatch, PES 2018 (now 2019) Soccer. I would expect a handful of games and every time I go to one it is PES night or something because that game always being played.But don\u2019t get discouraged by #47 as this entry all but makes up for it. I cannot vouch for their popularity stateside, but more and more retro cafes have been popping up recently. If there are places with big gaming scenes (i.e. Yongsan, Nanbu or another place famous for gaming) there are private retro cafes to go with them. I\u2019ve been to the one in Nanbu, but I have yet been to the one in Yongsan. I mainly know of these two areas because they happen to be the most popular.Yongsan Gamer Alley is the Akihabara of South Korea. If you want a game go there as they will likely have it. Nambu doe s have a more open selection. If your Korean\u2019s okay, you can go to Playstation (\ud50c\uc218) stores within the smaller towns, but the selection may be limited.Many games will be erroneously labeled as the Korean language version with Korean subtitles by both Playstation and Xbox. More often than not, it is because there is a lack of help to go around game studios for Korean translation assistance so there is a lack of VA talent that will take such gigs. You will find some studios that will go through the trouble of appeasing their Korean audience such as Sega\u2019s Yakuza studio or a private Korean publisher, but more often than not English will be the default language for games followed by Japanese as VA talent in Japan is high in demand in general and English is highly encouraged in Korea due to the English education boom. Note: This thing reached over 20K in views. I never thought people were that interested, but I guess I haven\u2019t experienced the Hallyu abroad as I have been in Korea during its duration. Thank you for supporting this post! I will continue to build upon it as I think of new things to add. To the commenters: please try to keep things civil and most importantly read what I wrote carefully. I understand the apartment one being easy to not experience, but if you go to older apartments some have eastern toilets. I just wanted to point out that more modern apartments have western toilets because quite frankly they are a bit of a nuisance to use. If the apartment is from the 2000s it will have either a Western toilet or a Western toilet with a bidet. So in response to this, I will add a \u201cside note\u201d section as to which these refer to. A good resource on toilets is the Toilet Museum in Suwon. They should also have a website or a documentary about the museum.Side note #1: For those that don\u2019t know what a bidet is:It is basically a western toilet with a dial on the side that gives your hindquarters a good scrubbing. The seat can also warm up. I will not add it to the list, but I think it should be noted that these are popular in Japan/Korea. These are more popular in Japan. This isn\u2019t referring to the bidet sink in France. This is a toilet, not a sink. And yes, you can still \u201cdo your business\u201d without pressing the buttons. Sidenote #2: In regards to Fact #18, I used \u201cManga\u201d because it\u2019s the actual US word. \u201cManhwa\u201d is only used in South Korea. But I am indeed speaking of Korean Manhwa \u201c\ub9cc\ud654 \u201c and not Japanese \u6f2b\u753b. But apologies in advance if anyone is offended by the U.S. choosing the word manga over manhwa. Japan simply introduced it in English first. It is more or less done in a similar artstyle with some differences. Sidenote #3, in regards to rice and kimchi. I have researched this fact upon arriving here 9 years ago. What started my research stemmed from the menus at \uae40\ubc25\ucc9c\uad6d kimbapcheonguk (simply known as Kimbap Heaven) and I noticed that their menus had a list of imported products. Upon learning enough Korean to make out menu items what struck me as odd was \uc0b0 and it\u2019s usage. (\ubc25 \ubbf8\uad6d\uc0b0, \uc18c\uace0\uae30 \ud638\uc8fc\uc0b0, \ub4f1 ) The way it was used was like \u7523 (san) in Japanese which means import. Now I know Koreans make a lot of their own kimchi, I\u2019m not disputing that, but restaurants account for the most consumed kimchi. Since I have gotten an inquiry on regarding that, here are some sources. Kimchi- The kimchi you eat outside of Korea is probably made in China Rice-Successful Online Promotions in Korea I\u2019m keeping up this link for useful information, but will also add a link in regards to how closely guarded the rice industry in Korea is. Korea just recently opened up a little in regards to this in 2017. https://www.kdevelopedia.org/resource/view/05201704110147512.do#.XXI5gigzaUk Recent Edit: I added and rephrased some answers and added a new factoid because the one regarding Kimchi no longer relates to the rice one for different reasons. We\u2019re at 51, so I make this longer at a later date. I also added additional details regarding attending weddings in Korea. Thank you all and a special thanks to Paul Light for helping me spot those 2 discrepancies! If there are any others, please let me know. Second Edit: Took out information that was actually erroneous in #15. No asses were harmed in the making of that edit. There are still eastern toilets, but they are going to be at old restuarants and some subway stations. I had no clue as to why I was stubborn to change that one.",

But I want to add couple of points..Too Many Cults - I don\u2019t know why but Korea seems to have disproportionate number. With cults you get all kinds of loonies and scandals. I absolutely despise these cults, and religion in general. A lot of the churches in both Korea and the US actually have characteristics of a cult. It\u2019s very dangerous and sad at the same time. These people could be putting their time and money into something more productive instead of enriching these shady pastors.Stubbornness and Narrow Mind - Especially true with older people. They are very much set in their ways. They are unwilling or incapable of accepting other people\u2019s opinions or criticism. Disagreement is taken as an offense. This makes them so difficult to get work with. I generally try to have nothing to do with them.Temper Issues - Some Koreans, not all, are extremely hot-headed. They can explode at any moment and become incredibly confrontational. Some will even throw tantrums in public which can be embarrassing and very shocking. Lot of Koreans don\u2019t know how to deal with such aggression so they suffer in silence.Extreme Attachment to National Identity - Koreans are way more nationalistic than Japanese or Chinese. Everything that a Korean does reflects on the entire Korean race especially when they are abroad. That\u2019s why when a Korean achieves something remarkable a lot of Koreans take extreme pride even though they have nothing to gain from this individual\u2019s success. Conversely, when a Korean does something embarrassing in front of a foreigner it\u2019s a national shame. They even have word for it \ub098\ub77c\ub9dd\uc2e0.Extremely Conservative - On the outside Korean culture may seem very progressive and liberal due to kpop, fashion and American influence. The reality is Korean culture is still very deeply conservative in their ways. People\u2019s dreams and desires are often repressed so that they can fulfill the expectations society or their parents have for them. In contrast China is the opposite. It looks conservative on the outside but it\u2019s actually very liberal closeup. A lot more people take risks in China and they are more straightforward about pursuing their needs and desires.White Worship - Although it seems to be improving, Koreans regard too highly of western countries and look down on dark people. They evaluate countries by GDP or some bullshit index. It\u2019s ridiculous. They should go watch some Nomad Capitalist videos to see how it really is in these countries. Unfortunately the Chinese also have this syndrome to an even more extreme extent.Lack of Creativity - Like their fellow East Asian neighbors Koreans aren\u2019t a creative bunch. And it\u2019s not difficult to see why. Their education system focuses way too much on rote memorization and not enough on developing critical thinking skills. Knowing certain historical dates is meaningless when you can just look it up Google now.Extremely Formal and Rigid Social Norms - Koreans are too serious sometimes. Everyone must carry themselves impeccably in their manners and speech. Faux pas are a no no. If you do something strange they will shun you or look at you like you\u2019re a weirdo. This dynamic is the reason why Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. Conformity is forced on the people.I can go and on but I will stop here.",

This has made South Korea one of the most extreme countries in either good or bad aspects. I mean, you may find very attractive characteristics but at the same time, quite toxic characteristics in South Korea. Two sided! But I think it\u2019s rather humane. XD\u203b UPDATED on Dec. 3rd, 2020.12 Bad Things of South Korea: \u203b DISCLAIMER \u203b Following bad things are not merely in the perspective of foreigners. That\u2019s not fair as we don\u2019t have any obligation to adjust ourselves for the non-Koreans. You need to take it into account in the very first place. Otherwise, you may fall in another imperialism-like mindset. So, following things are what even South Koreans don\u2019t like or want to see fixed. #1. Scarcity of Public Consideration (1) The Korean bump Many South Koreans don\u2019t apologize after bumping others or stepping on someone\u2019s foot. They just ignore or see you once, and just go away. Some of them even show you their uncomfortable faces. This usually happens by youngsters in 20\u201330s. (2) Some aged people are too noisy in public areas Public areas like subways, public restrooms, restaurants are what we all use. Of course, simple chatting or talking and using your phone in there is allowed. You may do these as you wish. However, it doesn\u2019t mean you can make any noise as much as you want. In this regard, especially aged people are sometimes too noisy. It\u2019s as if they think the whole place is theirs. #2. Ignorance of Global Systems Although it\u2019s changing fast year by year, but still quite a lot of South Koreans don\u2019t have enough global mindset, because they\u2019re isolated internationally. There are a few reasons for this isolation: one of them is the Korean language. Korean is one of the many language isolates, but the main problem is that the Korean language is almost only spoken and used by Koreans and in Korea. In other words, fairly lots of South Koreans are not able to communicate with foreigners or non-Korean speakers. This leads them into the isolation. One of the isolated systems in South Korea is their age system, The Korean age. Another one is internet purchase. People who experienced this in South Korea will feel related to this. Buying items on the internet is sometimes unnecessarily complicated in South Korea. I\u2019m not sure, but I suspect this is the most annoying online purchase system in the world. #3. Inferiority Complex towards Leading Countries (1) When it comes to leading countries Many people in both North Korea and South Korea have inferiority complex towards other developed and leading countries like Japan, the U.S., and Northern European countries like Norway or Switzerland. As for the complex towards Japan, this is particular compared to that towards other countries. South Koreans don\u2019t want to lose anything against Japan, and always hope to win Japan in every area. This is different in comparison of rightists and leftists. The leftists, so called \u201cMoonbats\u201d, are way too proud of their culture and country that they often get cocky to other developed countries. On the other hand, the rightists, so called \u201cWingnuts\u201d, have another toxic mindset in this manner that they even put themselves inferior to the white and Japanese while they mock and despise Southeast Asians and South Asians. (2) immature nationalism on the internet On the one hand, their inferior complex sometimes makes unattractive and immature faces of South Koreans on the internet. One of the naive faces is their overheating in some situations. A good recent example is when South Korea won Germany in a soccer game in the World Cup in Russia in 2018. After the victory, many South Korean netizens made fun of Germany, but it was too much. They just ridiculed Germany. I believe this is maybe one of the reasons why we often see especially German men feel uncomfortable about South Korea. (3) Ethnocentrism Another toxic mindset out of the inferior complex is their ethnocentrism when there is only a tiny proportion of Korean blood. This also induces them into nationalism and ethnic-Koreanism, which is akin to racism. South Koreans see oversea ethnic Koreans such as Korean-Americans just Koreans. So, if those oversea ethnic Koreans accomplish a great work, then South Korean newspapers feature it and put an emphasis on the \u201cKorean\u201d ethnic identity as if it was accomplished by a Korean in South Korea. All in all, it tells us that South Koreans are obsessed with the hope that they want to be acknowledged by others, especially by people of developed countries. This inferiority complex is also the reason why they like Europeans called \u201cwhite.\u201d If they praise and thumb up South Korea, then Koreans would feel super-flattered. But some of them can behave arrogantly. #4. Prevalent Hatred South Korea is one of the countries with severe social hatred towards everyone different from themselves. It\u2019s especially on the internet. There are major conflicts related with hatred in South Korea: \u2460 The older vs. the younger \u2461 Men vs. women \u2462 The urban vs. the rural \u2463 Capital area including Seoul vs. non-Seoul or non-capital area \u2464 The rich vs. the poor \u2465 Between provinces \u2466 The normal vs. the disabled \u2467 The higher educated vs. the lower educated and so on. Harshly speaking, South Koreans are busy to fight and hate each other, so to speak. In this situation, would their unification with North Korea possible? I highly doubt of this. They need to unify themselves earlier than North Korea. Unless, even if they unify, social hatred would arise more severely, maybe a form of civil war. #5. Spitting on the Street Many people, mostly men spit on the street regardless of their age and generation. This is actually their culture. This may contribute to the high occurrence of tuberculosis in South Korea. If you walk on some streets in South Korea especially in winter, you can easily see many young and aged men clear their throats and spit their phlegm on the street. It\u2019s really disgusting. #6. Crab Mentality The mindset \u201ccrab mentality\u201d is not an exception in South Korea. Let\u2019s suppose there\u2019s a highly reputed person. If people are normal, then they would say, \u201cI have to do my best to become like him/her.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s about achieving your goals and dreams. However, unfortunately, so many people think \u201cI want to drag that dude down from there to make him even to me\u201d. This is the crab mentality. This explains why so many South Koreans seek others\u2019 faults, especially of idols. If an idol makes a fault or severe mistake, then they aggressively attack and drag him or her down finally. A good example is Jimin of AOA who was the target of online assault, related to her knowledge in history. Were those who blamed her actually smarter or better than her in every area? Did they know about Korean history that well to denounce her? Most of all, do idols have to know better than others with such busy schedules? Is knowing less or being ignorant a sin for people not to be idols or a reputed person? Aren\u2019t they the same humans as us? Are they gods? #7. The End Justifies the Means There is a proverb, \u201cthe ends justify the means\u201d in English. As it says, it\u2019s not the only problem in South Korea. However, it doesn\u2019t mean it can be rationalized. Still quite a lot of South Koreans don\u2019t care whether the means they used had been inhumane or immoral if the result is well done. Hopefully, this is also being fixed by stricter laws and regulations. Regulation is the best way to fix bad manners, frankly. #8. Collectivism South Korea is the most collectivist country in East Asia along with North Korea. They don\u2019t distinguish what is different and wrong. They often consider being different as being wrong. This is the reason why we often see so many South Koreans obsessed with trends. They don\u2019t want to be isolated from others and wish to catch up to them. For example, if a certain coat is trendy in South Korea, then you can see people with the very similar or same coat everywhere, about 1 in 5 people. This tendency is especially serious in schools. Students have no choice but to buy trendy things regardless of their hope or taste. If they don\u2019t follow the trend, then they fall in danger of being bullied. This is also more among male students in middle schools. Of course, this collectivism isn\u2019t always bad. Especially about the COVID-19, this worked very effectively and nicely in coping with the spread of the virus. However, this answer is about bad things that I don\u2019t want to tell you about this here. #9. Age Hierarchy South Korean social culture runs largely based on ages. The older you are, the more you can do anything upon the younger. In other words, the younger you are, the less you can do something. The older you are, the more you can order others to do without any adjustment between you and them. The younger you are, the more you don\u2019t have rights to complain about problems even if it\u2019s not fair. #10. Education South Korea is notorious for its stressful education. They don\u2019t teach students with practical and helpful information for their lives and future, but they order them just keep memorizing things and solve as many questions as they can for the Korean SAT, Suneung (\uc218\ub2a5). All school educations in South Korea before colleges are centered at this. Putting it in another way, their goal of education is not students\u2019 future lives but making them enter higher university or college. Many foreigners give good advice like \u201cpassing the exam is not all of your life\u201d for South Korean students preparing Suneung. I really appreciate them. However, unfortunately, their advice doesn\u2019t work in South Korea. Actually, passing the Suneung (K-SAT) decides their destiny and lives in most cases. How sad it is! This is the reason why so many South Korean students commit suicide after the test. Moreover, sometimes even college education is not that objective. Some subjects or areas are driven politically. Of course, it\u2019s not just the matter in South Korea but in other East Asian countries like Japan, North Korea, China, and even some Western countries like the U.S. However, we have to be aware that even South Korea, a democratic country, is not an exception of this. Taking education in South Korean middle to high school is something you must avoid if you can. Why did I include middle school? Because the education in middle school and high school is systemically continuous. #11. Overall Corruption of the Society South Korean society is very corrupt. We often see justice dried up, and corrupt people have higher social stances and power. So, everything is twisted, and everyone is heavily stressed out. I suspect the top tier figures in South Korea have something to do politically each other in any form. The top 1, the president, must have so many fishy things deeply related to countless people in this field and that field. This is maybe the biggest reason why so many former presidents go to jail. #12. Denial and Justification This is what I found especially among Koreans. If someone write about bad sides about South Korea like this answer, then many Koreans deny with justification via cases of other countries. It\u2019s like this: \u201cIt\u2019s not only the case of South Korea. Japan also has it, and the U.S. and many other countries also have this problem. They also have their own many problems!\u201d Sometimes, they seem to think foreigners don\u2019t have the right to criticize South Korea. This leads them to be hostile towards the foreigners. However, it rather proves their criticism unlike the Koreans\u2019 denial. They even say like this: \u201c\u2026 it\u2019s time to look back on yourselves. Just see how your countries are. Every country has its own matters.\u201d \u2026 oh, yes. That\u2019s 100% right. Correct. However, does it solve the problems in South Korea? In my observation, South Koreans tend to consider such excuses are the best key to protect and stand up for their country.Honorary mentions #1. High Prices of Daily Products Well, this one is not what I\u2019m specialized in. The only one I know about this is that prices of daily products are quite high among the OECD countries. One thins well-known to South Koreans is that the prices of bread is most expensive in South Korea in the world. #2. Lookism It\u2019s well-known South Koreans take plastic surgery the most on the Earth. Their goals are diverse, but one of the major goals is their better beauty. One of the most popular plastic surgery is smallering their jaw, having double eyelids, and highering their nose. Because of this lookism, some people blame themselves for their ugly faces. You can share this answer if you want. Hope it helps. :)",

Fact check: In recent years, the Uygur population in Xinjiang has been growing steadily. From 2010 to 2018, the Uygur population in Xinjiang rose from 10.17 million to 12.72 million, an increase of 2.55 million or 25.04 percent. The growth rate of the Uygur population is not only higher than that of Xinjiang's total population, which is 13.99 percent, but also higher than that of all ethnic minority groups, which is 22.14 percent, let alone the Han population's 2 percent. -- Xinjiang enjoys social stability, with the people living and working in peace and contentment. The region has made unprecedented achievements in economic and social development and improvement of people's livelihood. From 2014 to 2019, the GDP of Xinjiang increased from 919.59 billion yuan to 1.36 trillion yuan, with an average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent. The per capita disposable income in Xinjiang increased by an average annual rate of 9.1 percent. Remarkable achievements have been made in poverty alleviation. All 3.09 million impoverished people in Xinjiang have been lifted out of poverty. The absolute poverty problem in Xinjiang has been resolved historically. -- The legitimate rights and interests of the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been protected. All ethnic groups, regardless of their population, have the same legal status and enjoy various rights in accordance with the law, including participation in the management of state affairs, freedom of religious belief, receiving education, using their own languages, and preserving their traditional culture. Lie No. 2: Adrian Zenz released reports claiming Xinjiang has carried out \"forced sterilization\" on the Uygur women, resulting in a sharp decline in the Uygur population. Fact check: Adrian Zenz is not a so-called \"expert on China studies,\" but a member of the far-right group \"Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation\" sponsored by the U.S. government. He is also a key figure in an anti-China organization set up by U.S. intelligence agencies and a notorious racist. -- Adrian Zenz's \"reports\" are full of fabrications and data manipulation. The so-called evidence of \"forced sterilization\" in the \"reports\" claims that 80 percent of the new intrauterine device (IUD) insertion procedures in China for 2018 were performed in Xinjiang and that the natural population growth rate in Hotan and Kashgar of Xinjiang in 2018 was only 2.58 per 1,000 people. The \"evidence\" is extremely inconsistent with the facts. -- According to data from China Health Statistics Yearbook 2019, published by the National Health Commission, the number of new IUD insertion procedures in Xinjiang in 2018 came in at 328,475, accounting for only 8.7 percent of China's total, which was 3,774,318. -- According to the 2019 Xinjiang statistical yearbook released by the statistics bureau of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the natural population growth rates in Kashgar and Hotan were 6.93 per 1,000 people and 2.96 per 1,000 people, respectively, in 2018. Lie No. 3: BBC Newsnight once reported that Zumrat Dawut (Zamira Dawut) was \"forced to go through sterilization\" in a vocational education and training center. Fact check: Zamira Dawut has never studied in any vocational education and training center. Her elder brother Abduhelil Dawut has previously clarified that. -- She claimed that after \"her release\" from a center, she was forced to be sterilized and her uterus was removed because she has already had three children. In fact, in March 2013, when Zamira Dawut gave birth to her third child in Urumqi Maternal and Child Care Service Center, she signed a childbirth consent form voluntarily to have a cesarean section and tubal ligation, and then the center conducted the operation. She was never sterilized, not to mention uterus removal. -- She claimed that her aging father was repeatedly detained and investigated by Xinjiang authorities, and died not long ago from an unknown cause. In fact, her father had been living with his children until he died from heart disease on Oct. 12, 2019. He had never been investigated or placed in detention. Her brothers Abduhelil Dawut and Elkin Dawut have both substantiated the facts. -- She claimed that she was served with pork in a relative's home. In fact, the relative she referred to is her elder brother Abduhelil Dawut's pairing relative Zhao Qilin. In October 2017, Abduhelil was paired up with Zhao as \"relatives,\" as part of an ethnic unity program. In January 2018, Abduhelil was invited to Zhao's home as a guest, in company with his younger sister Zamira Dawut. The meal was prepared by Zhao's mother, who herself is an ethnic Hui and a Muslim, and only eats halal food. It was impossible for her to provide a \"pork meal.\" Lie No. 4: In interviews with foreign media, Mihrigul Tursun said that she was forced to take unknown medications in a vocational education and training center and was diagnosed as infertile by American doctors. Fact check: On April 21, 2017, Mihrigul Tursun was taken into custody by the public security bureau of Qiemo County on suspicion of inciting ethnic hatred and discrimination. During this period, she was found to have infectious diseases such as syphilis. Out of humanitarian consideration, the county public security bureau terminated the measures against her on May 10, 2017. Except the 20 days of criminal detention, Mihrigul was totally free while in China. She was never sentenced, nor did she study in any vocational education and training center, let alone being forced to take medications. There are no records of her undergoing a sterilization procedure in China. Lie No. 5: Xinjiang sets up \"re-education camps\" to detain millions of Uygur Muslims. Fact check: Xinjiang has never had any so-called \"re-education camps.\" -- The vocational education and training centers established in Xinjiang in accordance with the law were education and training institutions in nature and were preventive counter-terrorism and deradicalization measures taken by Xinjiang. The aim was to eradicate the breeding ground for terrorism and extremism from the source. The relevant measures drew on the international community's experience in combating terrorism and deradicalization and implemented the idea of using development, education, and other resources to curb extremist ideologies, as advocated in the UN Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism. It fully complied with the principles and spirit of a series of international counter-terrorism resolutions, including the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Xinjiang's counter-terrorism and deradicalization measures have achieved positive results. There have been no violent terrorist cases for over four consecutive years in the region. -- The vocational education and training centers offered a curriculum that included standard spoken and written Chinese, understanding of the law and training in vocational skills to achieve the goal of deradicalization. By October 2019, all the trainees in such centers had completed their studies and graduated, and most of them have found stable jobs and lived a peaceful life. Lie No. 6: Xinjiang vocational education and training centers exercised \"religious control,\" political indoctrination, intimidation and torture over the trainees. Fact check: The vocational education and training centers fully respected and protected trainees' freedom of religious belief, ethnic customs and habits, and the right to use their own ethnic spoken and written languages. The trainees could decide on their own whether to take part in legal religious activities when they got home; a variety of nutritious Muslim food was provided free of charge; and the regulations, curriculum, and menus at the centers all used local ethnic languages as well as standard Chinese. -- The vocational education and training centers fully guaranteed the trainees' personal freedom and dignity. The centers employed a residential education model which allowed trainees to go back home on a regular basis, ask for leave to attend to personal affairs, and enjoy the freedom of correspondence. The centers strictly prohibited any form of humiliation or mistreatment. There were no such things as \"suppressing ethnic minorities\" or \"persecuting Muslims.\" -- The centers had well-equipped facilities. The dormitories were equipped with radio, TVs, air-conditioners or electric fans. Medical facilities, legal-counseling and mental-counseling rooms provided relevant services free of charge. The centers had sports venues for basketball, volleyball and table tennis, facilities for cultural activities, such as reading rooms, computer rooms and movie-screening rooms, as well as cultural and art performance venues, such as small auditoriums and open-air stages. Extra-curricular activities, such as folk songs and dances, sports competitions, etc., were held regularly to meet the various needs of trainees in study, life and entertainment to the maximum extent. All the trainees were covered in the public pension and medical insurance schemes, and were entitled to free health examinations. Lie No. 7: Some overseas Uygur people have been claiming \"their relatives or friends in Xinjiang cannot be contacted and have gone missing\" on overseas media and social media platforms. Fact check: Xinjiang protects the freedom of travel of people of all ethnic groups, including the Uygurs, and their communication with overseas relatives according to law. -- Verification with relevant departments shows that some allegedly \"missing\" people, mentioned by the \"East Turkistan\" separatists overseas, are living a normal life, while other \"missing\" incident reports are pure fabrications. -- The Australian Broadcasting Corporation once reported that Azmat Omar, a Chinese citizen living in Australia, claimed that he had lost contact with his family in Xinjiang. They included his father, stepmother, three brothers, two sisters, and over 20 other relatives. However, the fact is that all his relatives in China are living a normal life. -- During a UN Human Rights Council session in February 2020, the \"World Uygur Congress\" organized an activity outside the Palace of Nations in Geneva. They posted pictures of so-called \"Uygurs persecuted by the Chinese government.\" These pictures were later discredited as disinformation. Those in the pictures are living normal lives. Separatist groups stole their photos and personal information. Lie No. 8: Xinjiang uses the coronavirus to wipe out Uygurs, with many tragic deaths after infection. Fact check: Since the COVID-19 outbreak, Xinjiang has resolutely fought against the virus and effectively contained the epidemic within a short period. With the support of the expert team from the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism, the local government made all-out efforts to treat patients. The regional government adopted a targeted prevention and control approach with differentiated, scientific measures. It also strengthened epidemic prevention and control in places such as crowded and key venues to minimize the risk of virus spread. The local government has also made every effort to ensure the production and supply of food and other daily necessities while maintaining their sufficiency, quality and stable prices. These measures were widely supported by people of different ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Thanks to concerted efforts, all 826 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Xinjiang have been discharged from hospital after treatment, without even a single death. Lie No. 9: China systematically transferred 80,000 Uygurs out of Xinjiang and assigned them as \"forced labor\" to factories in other provinces. Fact check: The government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region works with a strong sense of responsibility to promote employment. Southern Xinjiang was an underdeveloped area with a low degree of industrialization and urbanization, where many people suffered from poverty due to lack of job opportunities. Based on the realities, local governments at all levels have taken active measures to help those in need of secure employment. These measures included creating job opportunities nearby, facilitating work in other areas in Xinjiang, or transferring work forces to other provinces and cities paired up to assist Xinjiang. Such measures have helped residents rise above poverty through employment and lead fulfilling lives, while guaranteeing various ethnic groups' right to labor and employment. -- Since 2018, 151,000 people in poverty-stricken families in southern Xinjiang have secured jobs away from their homes. Most of them worked in other parts of Xinjiang, while about 14,700 worked outside the region with the help of fellow villagers and relatives, or through human resources agencies. Those who work outside Xinjiang have their rights to customs, language and culture, and religious belief fully guaranteed. Many earn an annual income of 45,000 yuan, several times higher than the income from farming or working in their hometowns. Lie No. 10: Xinjiang forced a large number of Uygurs to pick cotton, contaminating the global supply chain. Fact check: A few years ago, when cotton matured in autumn, many migrant workers from Henan, Sichuan and other places would take trains to Xinjiang to pick cotton. They were called \"the cotton-picking forces.\" Migrant workers of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang would also go to pick cotton. They worked together, cared for each other and forged a deep friendship. These cotton pickers in and out of Xinjiang were all voluntary, and their incomes could reach over 10,000 yuan in just a month. -- In recent years, with the development of science and technology, cotton production has been highly mechanized in Xinjiang. Even in the busy cotton harvesting season, there is no need for a large number of cotton pickers. For example, since 2015, most of the cotton in the Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture of Bayingolin in Xinjiang has been harvested by machines. Lie No. 11: Xinjiang adopts an assimilation policy towards ethnic minorities in an attempt to systematically eliminate the Uygur culture. Fact check: All ethnic groups in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region enjoy full freedom to preserve or reform their own customs and habits. Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region strictly abides by the Constitution and laws, and attaches great importance to the protection and development of excellent traditional culture of all ethnic groups. -- The cultural heritage of all ethnic groups has been protected in Xinjiang. A batch of renowned architectural sites representing the preeminent historical and cultural heritage of the Uygur, Mongolian, Hui, Xibe and other ethnic minority groups have been properly renovated and preserved, including the Tomb of Afak Hoja in Kashgar, the Tomb of Tughluk Tumur in Huocheng, the Zhaosu Lamasery, the Former Residence of a Mongolian Prince in Hejing, and Chimtoghrak Manor. -- The excellent traditional culture of the ethnic groups has been passed on. Traditional cultural events, such as the Uygur's \"Meshrep,\" the Kazak's \"Aytes,\" the Kirgiz's \"Kobuz Ballad Singing Fair,\" the Mongolian \"Nadam Fair,\" the Xibe's \"West Moving Festival\" and the Han people's \"Lantern Festival,\" have been widely carried out. A number of impressive dramas with rich ethnic and regional characteristics have been staged, such as the Uygur play \"Gherip and Senem,\" the Kazak \"Aytes,\" and the Kirgiz \"Manaschi\" ballad drama \"Manas.\" -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has fully protected the customs and habits of all ethnic groups in the diets, festivals, weddings and funerals. Large and medium-sized cities and small towns with Muslim people in Xinjiang maintain a certain number of halal restaurants; \"halal canteens\" or \"halal kitchen facilities\" are set up in major traffic arteries and institutions with ethnic minority employees; beef and mutton supplied to Muslim people are slaughtered, processed, stored, transported and sold according to their customs. All ethnic groups enjoy statutory holidays during their traditional festivals, such as Corban Festival and Eid al-Fitr. -- Currently, people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang mainly use 10 spoken and written languages. Ethnic minority languages are widely applied in various sectors, including the judiciary, administration, education, press and publishing, radio and television, and the Internet. Xinjiang People's Broadcasting Station offers 12 radio channels in five languages: Mandarin, Uygur, Kazak, Mongolian and Kirgiz. Primary and secondary schools in Xinjiang offer courses in ethnic minority languages, such as Uygur, Kazak, Kirgiz, Mongolian and Xibe. Chinese RMB banknotes have five languages on them: Chinese, Tibetan, Uygur, Mongolian and Zhuang. Lie No. 12: Some places in Xinjiang destroyed graveyards of ethnic minority groups. Fact check: Xinjiang has always respected the funeral and burial customs of ethnic minority groups and formulated a series of regulations and policies to protect their basic funeral and burial rights. Measures, including allocating designated land and establishing special public cemeteries, are taken for some ethnic minority groups who traditionally bury their dead in the ground. Their traditional practices such as funeral pray, burial and holding Nazer (memorial activities), are preserved. -- With the economic and social development and the improvement of people's living standards in Xinjiang, governments at all levels have stepped up the planning and construction of public welfare cemeteries. Cemetery facilities and their environment are continuously improving. People of different ethnic groups in some places have relocated graveyards of their own free will. Lie No. 13: The Chinese government sends children of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang to boarding schools and \"forces\" them to be separated from their parents. Fact check: The Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: \"Where necessary, the people\u2019s government at the county level may set up boarding schools to ensure that school-age children and adolescents who are dwelling in scattered areas receive compulsory education.\" Xinjiang is a vast region with long distances between villages and towns, and it is not convenient for some students to go to school, making it hard to ensure their study quality. Parents have a heavy burden to transport their children to and from schools. To solve this problem, Xinjiang built 400 primary and secondary boarding schools in the 1980s. In recent years, Xinjiang, like the rest of the country, made scientific plans and reasonable arrangements for boarding school construction. They comply with the relevant construction standards of the state and the autonomous region to ensure sufficient learning and living facilities. Time has proved that boarding education has become an effective measure to accelerate education modernization and aid targeted poverty alleviation in Xinjiang. Parents of students of all ethnic groups support the boarding school model. -- The construction of boarding schools is an arrangement made by Xinjiang in light of the actual conditions of the autonomous region to alleviate poverty through education and improve the quality of compulsory education. It helps improve education modernization at primary and secondary schools of ethnic minorities and promote exchanges among different ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The practice here is not fundamentally different from that of other parts of China or the rest of the world. Lie No. 14: Schools in Xinjiang replace ethnic languages with Chinese to \"brainwash\" the students. Xinjiang has banned ethnic minority students from using their own languages and closed schools of the Uygur language. Fact check: The Constitution of the People's Republic of China and the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language stipulate that citizens have the right to learn and use the standard Chinese spoken and written language. The state provides them with related conditions. While promoting education in the Chinese language, Xinjiang also offers courses in the spoken and written languages of ethnic minority groups in accordance with the national curriculum plan for primary and secondary schools. This safeguards the right of students from ethnic minority groups to learn their own spoken and written languages. It also effectively promotes the inheritance and development of ethnic minority languages and cultures. -- Primary and secondary education in Xinjiang is conducted in seven languages. At present, preschools and primary and secondary schools across Xinjiang provide bilingual education in the national standard spoken and written language, as well as one ethnic language. Learning to use the national standard language can help people better integrate and adapt to modern society. It brings more convenience in studies, job hunting, communication, business, and work. Lie No. 15: Xinjiang suppresses ethnic minorities under the pretext of fighting terrorism. Fact check: Incomplete statistics show that from 1990 to 2016, ethnic separatists, religious extremists, and violent terrorists plotted and conducted several thousand violent terrorist acts. They killed many innocent civilians and several hundred police officers and caused immeasurable property losses. These terrorist activities inflicted untold suffering on the people of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. -- In the face of a complicated counter-terrorism situation and the demands from people of all ethnic groups to stop terrorism, China's Xinjiang region has taken a series of active measures. Responding to the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and other counter-terrorism resolutions, Xinjiang has upheld the principle of not linking terrorism with any particular region, ethnic group, or religion. It acted within the law to crack down on violence and terrorist activities that violate human rights, endanger public security, undermine ethnic unity, and aim at separating the country. Since 2014, a total of 1,588 violent and terrorist groups have been taken out, 12,995 violent terrorists arrested, and 2,052 explosive devices seized. Such operations have effectively curbed the infiltration of extremism, significantly improved public security, and protected the right to life, right to health, right to development, and other basic rights of people of all ethnic groups. Xinjiang has reported no violent terrorist cases for more than four consecutive years. Lie No. 16: The \"fanghuiju\" campaign, in which civil servants are dispatched to grass-roots communities to offer help to people of various ethnic groups, as well as the \"ethnic unity campaign\" and solidarity activities among cadres and people of different ethnic groups, are all adopted by Xinjiang with the aim of intervening in and monitoring Uygur families. Fact check: Xinjiang has been carrying out the \"ethnic unity campaign\" and solidarity activities among cadres and people of different ethnic groups since 2016. More than 1.1 million cadres and workers of different ethnic groups have paired up with 1.6 million people of different ethnic groups as \"relatives\" and made friends with each other. Among them, Han cadres have paired up with ethnic groups, including the Uygur. Cadres of ethnic minority groups, including the Uygur, have also paired up with Han people. -- Based on mutual exchange, communication, integration, respect and help, cadres and workers of different ethnic groups have given full play to their own advantages, guiding the grass-roots residents to expand their approaches to prosperity, and helping them solve difficulties in healthcare, employment and education, and doing many good deeds that have won public support. According to the statistics, the cadres and workers participating in the \"ethnic unity campaign\" and solidarity activities among cadres and people of different ethnic groups have donated 940 million yuan and more than 49 million material items to the grass-roots people, accomplishing some 18 million deeds that benefit locals. Lie No. 17: Xinjiang monitors Uygur Muslims through ubiquitous cameras, mobile phone apps, the internet and other high-tech means. Fact check: In accordance with the law, Xinjiang has installed cameras in urban and rural public areas, major roads, transportation hubs and other public places in order to improve social governance and effectively prevent and crack down on crime. These measures have enhanced social security and won widespread support from people of all ethnic groups. The measures do not target any particular ethnic group. -- The use of modern scientific and technological products and big data to improve social governance is a common practice in the international community. According to the South China Morning Post, a new study found that Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands are among the top 10 countries in terms of the number of surveillance cameras in the world. Lie No. 18: Chinese embassies and consulates have refused to renew the passports of overseas Uygur people, forcing them to return home to face extrajudicial detention or imprisonment. Fact check: Chinese citizens' personal freedom and rights of exit and entry are protected by law. As long as they are Chinese nationals and admit themselves that they are Chinese citizens, and do not violate Chinese laws and regulations, they can apply to the Chinese embassy or consulate where they live for the renewal or replacement of passports. -- Chinese embassies and consulates conduct their services in accordance with the Exit and Entry Administration Law of the People's Republic of China, the Passport Law of the People's Republic of China and other laws and regulations to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese of different ethnic groups. Chinese citizens from Xinjiang who apply for the renewal or replacement of passports at Chinese embassies and consulates have been accepted and approved after being examined to comply with relevant laws. Lie No. 19: The Chinese government bans foreign journalists from going to Xinjiang for reporting. Fact check: Xinjiang is an open place. Foreign journalists are allowed to report in Xinjiang on condition that they abide by Chinese laws and go through relevant procedures, according to the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on News Coverage by Permanent Offices of Foreign Media Organizations and Foreign Journalists. There are no circumstances in which the Chinese government forbids foreign journalists to report in Xinjiang. -- Since the end of 2018, more than 1,200 people from over 100 countries and regions, including officials from international organizations, diplomats, journalists and religious leaders, have visited Xinjiang. -- From Sept. 3 to 7, 2019, NBC reporters went to Xinjiang for reporting. -- In December 2020, BBC reporters went to Kuqa County and other places in Xinjiang for reporting. Lie No. 20: The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights will be restricted from visiting Xinjiang. Fact check: China welcomes the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to visit China and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and has always maintained close communication with the United Nations. Lie No. 21: Xinjiang suppresses Islam and freedom of religious belief. Fact check: Respecting and protecting the freedom of religious belief is a basic long-term policy of the Chinese government. Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates that Chinese citizens have freedom of religious belief. The principle of religious freedom enshrined in the Constitution has been fully implemented in Xinjiang. Xinjiang citizens' right to freedom of religious belief has been fully guaranteed. The religious feelings, belief-based needs and customs of religious citizens have been fully respected, legal religious activities guaranteed by law, and religious and cultural heritage protected. -- Xinjiang has translated and published religious classics and books, such as the Koran and Selections from Al-Sahih Muhammad Ibn-Ismail al-Bukhari, in Mandarin Chinese, the Uygur, Kazak and Kirgiz languages, providing convenience for religious believers of all ethnic groups to acquire religious knowledge. -- Since 1996, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government has organized local Muslims to take charter flights for a pilgrimage every year, except for the cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and has provided high-quality services in entry and exit, medical care, catering, etc., so as to ensure the safe and orderly pilgrimage activities and ensure that local Muslims of all ethnic groups successfully complete their pilgrimage. Lie No. 22: Xinjiang demolishes many mosques. Fact check: Mosques in Xinjiang meet the regular religious demands of followers in terms of quantity. Governments at various levels in Xinjiang have consistently improved the public services of mosques. The government has funded the introduction into mosques of running water, electricity, natural gas, roads, communication, radio and television, and libraries. Ablution facilities and flushing toilets have been installed. Mosques have also been equipped with medical services and electronic displays. They also have computers, electric fans or air conditioners, firefighting equipment, drinking water dispensers, shoe coverings or machines for shoe coverings, and lockers. These measures have been welcomed by religious personnel and believers. Lie No. 23: Xinjiang \"persecutes\" religious personnel. Fact check: The cultivation and training of clerical personnel have been strengthened in Xinjiang. The region has ten religious colleges and schools, including the Xinjiang Islamic Institute, its eight branches in places like Kashgar, Hotan and Ili, and the Xinjiang Islamic School. These colleges recruit a certain number of undergraduate, junior, and technical secondary school students every year, with student numbers exceeding 3,000. Lie No. 24: Xinjiang bans fasting of Muslims. Fact check: Muslims of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, in accordance with their teachings, canons, and traditional customs, practice regular religious activities such as fasting and Islamic festivals in mosques and their own homes. Such activities are totally of their own free will, without any interference or restriction. -- During Ramadan every year, it is an entirely personal choice for Muslims to fast or not fast. Governments at all levels in Xinjiang make every effort to ensure the market supply and security of religious activities of Eid al-Fitr and other festivals.",

After 1973 (Yom Kippur War) Arab-Israeli War, badly-defeated, outnumbered Arabs were started seeking geo-political support outside their regime with Islamic card. They were trying to establish the image that Arab is Islam and Islam is Arab. Islamic Praying language is still Arabic across the globe, and this comes handy for their cause. Religion and Culture are intertwined and inseparable, but when it comes to a foreign religion, it never go togehter. Hence Islam adapted local culture and spreaded, grown and survived for several centuries in different parts of the world. Only linking thread for rest of the world muslims is the prayer procedures and its language. Arabs were targeting this exactly. This propaganda and continuous geopolitical maneuvers had created a wedge in UN, and pro & anti-israeli groups were formed, and mostly it was only about Israeli-Palestenian issues. In 1979, the Iran revolution happened which was shouting loud about democracy and echoed across Middle East. Kingdoms in Middle East were shaken, and sought US help. With a Peak Oil theory circulating to support the US Military intervention, US foreign policy were focused on protecting US energy security by helping Middle Eastern Kingdoms. CIA has another agenda which is to chase out Russians from Afghanistan. Thus CIA were closely working with Saudis, the child was \u201cWahabbism\u201d. Saudi had spent close to US$1 billion to bring all those mullahs in the poor countries to Saudi and taught them about NEW ISLAM, which is Wahabbism. Mosques were generously funded in all those Asian and African third-world countries by Saudi Arabia. Large number of Muslims were employed, preached and returned to their home countires with a idea of Wahabbism as is the original islam. When the directive comes from Mosque as new tenets of Islam, which is focusing to build Arab is Islam and Islam is Arab, the followers have little leeway to reject those new ideologies which hitherto they were never heard of. This made those culturally aligned local muslims started wearing long dresses, adopted strange practices and forced their women to change their attire completely. The existence of Muslims in those non-Arab countries were not visible all these centuries, but suddenly they look completely foreign now. Alienation started building in the local community. Usual routine cultural practices were replaced or stopped among the local muslim community, and they were becoming more \u201cArabic\u201d than \u201cLocal\u201d. This has helped the saudi-funded mullahs to brainwash and prepare to \u201cprotect Islam\u201d as Jihadhists in Middle East and Afghanistan. Actual quranic meaning of Jihad was distorted for the convenience of CIA and Saudi Arabia. We have seen the consequences for the Islamic community for the last 30 years. Let\u2019s come back to Uighurs in China. China\u2019s Xinjiang is conveniently located at the border of Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, where Islamic influence exists for several centuries, and Xinjiang plays a crucial role in the historical silk route. Uighurs were existing and thriving as Muslims for more than 1000 years in Xinjiang with their local culture. When the CIA-funded Saudi-originated Wahabbism engulfed them, they were found fighting in Middle East for the Islamic Kingdoms and US. At one time, Syria alone had some 15,000 Uighur fighters on the field, beleiving they were fighting for \u201cprotecting islam\u201d. They were returning to China, and this poses a huge headache for China. Actually CCP had ignored them during China\u2019s industrial development years. Uighurs too had their own grievances as if they had felt left out of China success story. China is amending those grievences by enabling them with technical skills and mandarin language, so that they can visit and work in other parts of China. While imparting technical training skills, they were also reminded of their native culture and language, while following their religion. China is bringing them into the mainstream of Chinese society, and empower them with technical skills, and investing billions in infrastructure to improve the Xinjiang region. The results are inspiring. Almost all nations were invited to visit Xinjiang region to witness what is happening. OIC (which comprises 56 islamic countries) visited Xinjiang and felt good about what Chinese Government is doing. Why those 22 countries are not happy? Those 22 countries were thought of using those radicalised Uighurs to destablise China\u2019s growth. It couldn\u2019t be done now. Hence, they started spreading rumours, and at the height of insane, US is banning Chinese Businesses and officials in the name of protecting Xinjiang Muslims, while US itself has banned Muslims visiting US from 8 countries. Muslims are being used as a pawn by US for its own benefits. Those Muslim nations aware of this, hence no Muslim country is supporting the US on blaming Chinese Government on Uighurs. Allies have no choice but to take the toe line of US.",

They did so by filling media with anti-Jew propoganda. If you read / watch Chinese media today, you will find no such anti-Uyghur propoganda (probably to your disappointment).In order to physically exterminate millions upon millions of Jews, Nazi Germany had built many concentration camps (labor camps, extermination camps, etc.) across the country and in occupied territories in France, Poland, etc. If you Google map China, you will find no such facilities. The \u201cconcentration camps\u201d that BBC and other Western media so proudly revealed, are actually primary schools, nursing homes, government buildings, law courts, etc. In other words, they are not real concentration camps. Not every walled facility is a concentration camp, you know.You do remember \u201cCrystal Night\u201d? The event in which all Jewish shops and restaurants etc. were vandalized and torched? If you want to destroy a people, first step is to deprive them of any property. On the contrary, you can find Uyghur shops and restaurants across the country.

It\u2019s Hui (with around 11 million population). In a Nazi-like mind, Zhuang or Hui should be the biggest threat, not Uyghur. But again, if CPC is Nazi-like, why did it grant the other 55 ethnic groups \u201cminority\u201d status and give them a lot of preferential policies? It\u2019s just illogical!If you are really wise and think independently, I believe you have reached your conclusion. Western education always stresses \u201ccritical thinking\u201d.

I was grew up with Kazakh children and my best friend is a Kazakh.Han culture is different from Kazakh culture.Kazakh was once a nationality of leading a nomad's life on history relying on a lifestyle of livestock breeding,however with the improvement of living standards,some of them choose to live in citys.They have their own language.Kazakh who live in XinJiang usually use Arabic alphabet.But many Kazakh in Kazakhstan use Cyrillic alphabet. Most of them are Muslim\uff0cbut compared with the tradition of nomad\u2019s life,Islam is only a small part of their lives.For example,drinking is forbidden in Koran,but Kazakh can\u2019t live without alcohol,they love drink and they can drink a lot. Kazakh are very hospitable.Everytime you go to their family,they\u2019ll serve you the best food and delicious horses\u2019 milk(I guess many of you may not like it,but for me,it\u2019s gorgeous).After dinner,they will play Dongbula\uff08something like guitar\uff09and sing Kazakh song for you and may even dance with you. Uighurs\uff1aUighurs account for forty-seven percent of Xinjiang's population.Most of them live in South Xinjiang. They are very smart and they are good at doing business.They have their own language and use Arabic alphabet.Most of them are Muslim and most of them are very religious.More and more Uyghur women start to use veil to cover their face and hair.They refuse to drink alcohol and smoke cigarette.Uighurs who live in North Xinjiang are more secular,girls don\u2019t use veil and they dare to show their body. I have to admit that most of Uighurs don\u2019t like Chinese government and they are exclusive of Han\u2019s culture.There have been a lot of violence events(or the western media so called \u2018Racial repression\u2019\uff09over the years.A lot of innocent died(Most are innocent Uighurs)because they want to build a independent country called \u201cEast Turkestan\u201d. Ironically,they forget that their ancester cooperated with Tang dynasty and together they beat the Turks. Hui\uff1aThe former Han who converted to Muslim,Han-Arab\u2019s descendants together they formed Hui.They spread all over China,but most of them live in the Ningxia province. Hui don\u2019t have their own language,They speak Chinese and use Chinese character.Some of them are conservatives,the male always in white clothes and white round hat.The female use scarf cover their hair,but they don\u2019t cover their face like the arabs do.The conservatives are devout Muslims. However,others are not very conservative,they accept secular education and Han\u2019s culture,they dress like Han,talk like Han,act like Han.Some of them may even give up their religion and eat pork.You can\u2019t judge if they are Hui or Han until they tell you. ZangMy girlfriend is a Zang.She live with me now in Sichuan province where most of people are Han,but she and her family originate from Tibet. Zang are live in the Qinghai Xizang Plateau,some Zangs live a nomadic life,others live a life of farming.Most of them believe in Tibetan Buddhism.Tibetan Buddihism is differnt from Chinese Buddhism\uff0cbut the two are not as opposed to the Sunni and Shia. Zang are good at sing and dancing,some singer from Tibet are very famous in China\uff0clike Hanhong and Jamyang Dolma(But my girlfriend sucks).Because of the hard living condition,most of them have darker skin than Han,and they are taller and stronger than Han. They are genuine and sincere\uff0cthey will treat you like a family as long as you earn their trust. ManchusI guess you may say,no!It\u2019s not a Manchu,it\u2019s a Han. Manchus are like this:or this:But the truth,Manchus are disappearing.Yes,the people who once rulde China are disappearing.Nowadays,they\u2019re just like Han.They have lost all their national characteristics. Manchus are political ethnic group consist of Jurchens,Han,Mongolian and some Korean.Most of them are Jurchens,they had their own language and words which are different from the language of Han\u2019s. But when they finally conquered China,in order to control massive land and people\uff0cthey have to choose Hanization(accept Han\u2019s culture).They forced Han shaved their hair and wore their clothes,but that is Han\u2019s culture they cannot change. After the collapsed of Qing dynasty,because of the fear of revege of Han,most Manchus change their nationality to Han.The long time of culture invation caused the last person who can speak Manchu language die out. They are totally Han now.Most of them may even accept the fact."

It's the trap so many movies and media have fallen into in the name of diversity. You're writing a person. Imagine that persons life and try to imagine what kind of character that life would produce.

You're writing a female black character when you should be writing a character that is black and female. Don't feel bad. It's the trap so many movies and media have fallen into in the name of diversity. You're writing a person. Imagine that persons life and try to imagine what kind of character that life would produce. Her race and gender would be factors sure, but so would her education, her childhood, her relationship with her parents, her shortcomings, her skills etc. People are more complex than their skin and gender, and we focus on those two factors we end up with caricatures rather than characters. You see it all the time. Movies that promote that tough, black, female character that kicks ass. They never promote the tough, white, male characters in the same way. It shows that fundamentally they don't actually understand the problem they're addressing, because they only recognise a lack of diversity rather than a lack of understanding of their character. If your story is primarily focused on racism and/or sexism, I would suggest hefty research. Don't whitesplain racism. Don't mansplain sexism. Understand them. Speak to people who have experienced it first hand and analyse what it's done to their character. How did it make them feel? What decisions in their life did they make because of it? What decisions didn't they make? Understand the character not the colour. I don't agree with other answers basically saying that you shouldn't write a main character that is something you're not. So all of my characters should be smug, white, kinda arrogant, SJW, musicians who spend too much time eating burritos and watching Netflix? Cos I spend my life inside my own character, God knows I don't want to inflict it on the reader. Does that mean we can't write pirates or serial killers or left handed people unless we are those things? Of course not. The difference is that race, gender and sexuality are touchy issues at the moment due to social shift in attitude. Everyone is walking on egg shells and it's costing us some level of creativity for fear of vilification. Unfortunately this is counter-productive as it restricts the discussion for fear of offence. It further alienates the already bigoted and hamstrings the open minded. We should be embracing discussion and understanding of our differences in any form it takes. The key is respect. Respect isn't making your female lead basically flawless and having her best the overtly sexist manpig in her life. That's a caricature. Understand her weakness and strength. Respect her humanity not her vagina. You may make mistakes and that's okay. You're never going to completely understand anyone elses perception of the world as well as your own, but if you're writing a character who is black and female, rather than writing a black female\u2026 those mistakes will, like your character, make you nothing less than human :) Go forth and create something awesome!",

Men write about women, straight people write gay characters and vice versa, perfectly nice people write through the eyes of serial killers, young people write about old people. Imagination, empathy, and research go a long way. Assuming you are not black, there are two main things to avoid: Treating your character as a stereotype or special (in either a good or bad way) because of her skin color and gender. Regardless of color, gender, sexual orientation or what have you, she is human. Well, unless she's an alien or fantasy character--but even those characters usually act like humans. Writing from a perspective where race is a primary factor in the story. There's no way a white male writer is going to be the next Alice Walker. If the black woman is your protagonist, the main focus should not be on her race and gender. For example, she's a top scientist trying to save the world from Armageddon who happens to be a black woman. As FeiFei points out, research is critical. Read novels and articles by black women. And have a black woman look over the finished manuscript to make sure you're not accidentally doing something cringeworthy with that character. For a good look at writing varied characters well, I recommend Alyssa Cole, an author in my genre (romance) who's also written quite a bit for online publications. She's a black woman whose protagonists are black women, but the love interests are males of various ethnicities, and in one book, the love interest is female. All that said, there are no writing rules, only guidelines. If there's a black woman character in your head demanding that you write her story down, do it.",

This basically goes for any character. Sure, talking things out and getting feedback from someone of that group helps TONS. And sometimes it\u2019s a real slap in the face moment for you. But so long as you are being respectful does it work. I once played with a story of a bunch of gang bangers in Detroit who were being hunted by vampires. I couldn\u2019t get the feel right. I talked to a black guy I knew and he read some and went, \u2018Okay, they\u2019re bangers. What else are they?\u2019 Like, they didn\u2019t have family, hopes, plans, wants\u2026 it was just sex, drugs, and violence. And he said that it would be fine to have one character like that, but not all of them. And then he told me why people get into gangs in the first place: self respect, economics, broken family, and why bangers see their gang as the best they can do in a world set against them. He absolutely loved the premise though. \u2018White dudes coming in, fucking shit up, and literally sucking our blood out and nothing the cops will do shit about? And black folks are the ones to kick their asses and handle it? Dude, I\u2019d be all over it.\u2019 Sometimes wish I finished it\u2026",

Most fans are so enthralled and in love w/ the series\u2026 they\u2019re willing to turn a blind eye or completely ignore aspects that make them uncomfortable. While I really enjoyed Naruto, I\u2019m not blind to the message put forth, or how it tends to smooth away concepts, it doesn\u2019t want to actually deal w/. This could\u2019ve worked in the franchise\u2019s favor if it did own up to the darker aspects of the Naruto-verse whole heartedly. Kishimoto did a great job when it came to piecing together themes and relationships (not the romantic ones lol), but tends to sideline or ignore the deeper ramifications of actions or views that were deemed political. Only dipping his toe in certain subject matter or including hints of it, but never diving deeper than comfortable for the audience. Naruto dealt w/ tons of adult or Seinen subject matter that was intertwined w/ a Shonen aesthetic, but it never commited to intelligently discussing any of it. (Only in shades) It wasn't utilized or at least, realized to it\u2019s full extent. Understandably, it couldn\u2019t be unless Kishimoto had real finesse to pull this off. Or the series took a drastic turn\u2014which I doubt\u2026 Shonen Jump and the fans would\u2019ve appreciated. When compared to other Shonen series like Bleach for example: BLEACH did deal w/ darker subject matter and in this instance.\u2026.I think it did a better job at flushing out the horrors and beauty of Soul Society, Shinigami, Hollow, Vizards, our idealistic and false concepts of war and peace; hero\u2019s and villians. Ichigo carried a lot of weight and changed overtime in a way that felt more authentic and real. The characters and concepts were extremely varied, hard to pin down and often had complicated interwoven relationships. BLEACH wasn\u2019t perfect, but it did a better job of calling out corruption, hypocrisy, elitism, death, and b.s.  (Byakuya cried\u2026. ~fangirl sobs~ oh lord and begged for help\u20262020 what have you done!!)  The Hyuga\u2019sThe Hyuga\u2019s are a noble clan within the walls of Konoha that are extremely beneficial to the village. It has prestige, honor, money, contracts, land and a very unique and expressive Doujutsu that\u2019s well known\u2026 throughout the Naruto-verse. Other villages are willing to kill in order to obtain those mirrory eyes. They\u2019re the greatest trackers within Konoha and are invaluable to the Land of Fire. Despite that\u2014this clan is also known for the strict heirarchy it enforces on those born into the Hyuga bloodline. Those of the Main Branch are left unmarked and free to do as they wish, as long as they stay within the clan, or enrich the clan. They have freedom of choice, freedom to go where they please and are looked after hand and foot from birth till death. They pass along secret techniques that are not known to the Lesser Branch. The Lower Branch however\u2014 is a different story. These relatives are born to a line that is marked w/ a cursed seal from a very early age. They learn to live w/ it.. cause they don\u2019t know any better or are unable to stop it. The jutsu is a secret contained by the Main Branch; which will never be revealed, lest they give up their dominance. These people live and die by the words of those above them. Step out of line and their tortured for it. Their lives are seen as expendable for the Noble clan. These people have no real free will nor can they pursue what they\u2019d like. They are prisoners until the day they die, or are conveniently brainwashed to endure and enjoy their servitude.Hinata is the Main Branch ex-heiress and has a full life. Neji the Lower Branch cousin is dead. This is seen as preferrable and perfectly all right to some of the fandom. I\u2019ve seen fans makes countless excuses for this and claim that nobody forced Neji to sacrifice himself. Yet Neji\u2019s death was seen as a way to obtain freedom. One could even call if a conscious suicide and it\u2019s seen as okay. This truly leaves me baffled at the way some people rationalize the event and the message it gave. Then the series likes to claim Naruto changed the clan, he changed everything. Yet how did this occur? What did he do to change a clan that has never changed under the ruling of any other Hokage before? The Hyuga\u2019s can\u2019t be forced. This is never explained in depth or even makes an attempt to make sense of words that mean nothing really. Why wasn\u2019t this Hinata\u2019s job? She\u2019s the Hyuga and has the intimate knowledge of this, not Naruto. Neji died for her and indirectly because of her. Why does this series like to claim better days are here, but never show us a Branch Member? Why would a tradition of forced slavery and servitude be relinquished for a guy w/ next to no experience on the matter? This serves the Hyuga clans interest. More so than the village of Konoha, because the other Hokages knew they had no say in how the noble clans operate within their own space. These clans are sovereign to themselves, but serve Konoha out of honor, in oaths, and for profit. Everyone benefits. If this clan allowed its lesser members freedom\u2026 than shouldn\u2019t there be other half Hyuga children out there somewhere? Wouldn\u2019t some of these people be bitter or just get the hell outta dodge and live elsewhere? I don\u2019t buy it and think it\u2019s b.s. Something said to pull the fleece over the eyes of fans who rather not look any deeper. This clan has real issues w/ inequality and it\u2019s ugly, but its often glossed over.  Familial Incest Fans also, like to ignore the implications of incest within this franchise and especially concerning major clans. The clans that kept it within the bloodline are usually larger and more prominent than those who married out more.1. The Hyuga all damn near look alike and not one has any diffrentiation when it comes to their eyes. All of them have that ghostly eyed gaze. That comes from excessive inter-breeding. If Hinata and Hanabi are the so called, \u201cpurest\u201d than what does that entail?2. The Aburame clan is another shout out to the dreaded topic. These are breeders of special insects that offer their bodies as nests. These insects share a symbiotic relationship w/ its human host. Yet cause of this\u2026 the Aburame are extremely sensitive, deadly and absolutely not compatible for the average civilian or ninja. Even Shino is covered from head to toe, and he rarely\u2026 if ever, reveals his eyes. Bugs are literally embedded within him. That means\u2026 this clan has to breed among themselves. They\u2019re only suited for each other and are extremely specialized. It be too risky to marry anyone else. ~Ewww~ lol3. The Uchiha\u2019s were similar to Samurai families. They intermarried, but could develop relationships outside of the clan. Maybe resulting in bastard children that were deemed lesser, but absorbed into the Uchiha clan. They held disdain for anyone who married a non-Uchiha, but since this clan is extremely patriarchial and share a warrior fetish. I think the backlash was experienced more by the females than males. The men could have affairs or relationships w/ other non-uchiha women, but the children were taken. (Or they married them) The women however\u2014 were probably seen as a valued resource. Thus resulting in their departure from the clan or pregnancy by a non-Uchiha as scandalous. This probably felt threatening to their dominance. Which is a very real concept. Half Uchiha\u2019s would marry full Uchiha\u2019s. This just kept their bloodline fresh.  Elitism & GeneticsIn the Naruto-verse power and genetics are EVERYTHING. It sucks to say, but the average ninja and civilian doesn\u2019t have a say in anything that goes down. Bloodlines matter, because prestige, influence and heritance all play a major role in this franchise. All of the major players are clan brats; while everyone else is fodder. This series has literally curbed stomped the concept of \u201cThe...",

I\u2019m talking about this\u2026Or more precisely this\u2026  This is an ability that belongs to the Tailed-Beasts and through them to their jinchurikies alone. Remember the sewer in which Naruto often meets Kurama, now that mind world is a similar mental plane like this, just a shallower plane. Now, that place can indeed be invaded by others, such as Sasuke who did it in early Shippuden, or Shin clones in Boruto, or like when Isshiki did it in the manga, he saw Naruto\u2019s conversation with Kyuubi. But this deeper plane cannot be invaded, not even by Rinnegan users. In this world, like any dream, \u2018time works differently\u2019. If you go to Chapter 572. you will see that in that \u2019instant\u2019 Naruto pulls the Chakra Receiver Rods out of all the Bijuus\u2019 necks, he enters this mental plane and has a whole conversation with the bijuus and their jinchurikies and then gets out remembering everything. So, this is an ability that isn't abused as often. I mean, a jinchuriki can enter in here mid-battle and think up complex manoeuvres and reach out to execute them outside, they would not have to worry about the time it takes because, in this dream plane, time works differently, it is up to the will of the bijuus. Furthermore, think of the genjutsu resistance this provides the jinchuriki. Stuck in a genjutsu? No matter, the Bijuu disrupts your chakra and slaps some sense into you. And people like Madara would not be able to get inside the psyche to put the Bijuu in a genjutsu of its own, because even Rinnegan users cannot enter into this deeper spiritual plane. So, as you can guess, this is one of those topics everyone in the fandom knows, but don\u2019t really have much to talk about. Hope, I piqued your interest\u2026 Let me know in the comments\u2026",

Still blows my mind why so many people decided to stay on this tiny island of Manhattan.The people - Nobody is trying to make F.R.I.E.N.D.S in NYC. People can be superficial and cutthroat, only befriending you if you have some sort of social status. While it\u2019s a huge city, it\u2019s also a city of strangers. Took me a while to find a solid group of people who I could call friends.Lifestyle - Super fast paced. Feels like time goes 2x faster in NYC than any other place. People are working 60 hour weeks and can go many months without even seeing the sun (come in around 7am and leave around 2am).The awesome:The seasons - NYC is beautiful in the fall, cold as F in the winter, lively in the Spring and hot as F in the summer. The holiday season was my favorite - you could really see the city light up with smiles and giving.The diversity - You can meet all kinds of people and eat all kinds of food. When I went to Chinatown for the first time, I thought I was back in China. Got to practice my Mandarin.The bustling - There\u2019s a lot going on in NYC from the political to the financial to the media. There\u2019s no shortage of events/things to do. Many times, I would find myself immersed in some sort of event just by walking around the city. One time I took a company car home at 3am and saw the city still lit up. It\u2019s truly a city that never sleeps.The subways - No cars needed, just take the subway to get around. The subways are super convenient and runs all night. You learn to develop a love/hate relationship depending when you take the subway and what subways you take. For me, the G train played hard to get with me at times.The people - Not all people are mean. I found a good group of friends in Brooklyn and a great squad through church. People are generally receptive if you put in the effort to show them that you care.While it was tough living in NYC, it was a great life experience in hindsight. I learned a lot and met a lot of really diverse and smart people. I can testify that if you can make it in NYC, you can make it anywhere. If you\u2019re in your early 20s, go suffer and live it up in NYC :)Me and bunch of clueless 20-somethings with their big boss Mayor Bloomberg.",

My husband and I live in a 650 square foot apartment in Chelsea, which is a neighborhood in Manhattan, and we pay $4,000 a month rent. This rent is typical in much of Manhattan, unless you rent in a four story walkup. There are lower rents in Harlem, but that is starting to change. It\u2019s loud. Noise is everywhere. The traffic, beeping horns, the subway trains, sirens, loud people. It takes a while to adapt. Work. It's a hard working city. Many people put in very long hours, whether to make those large corporate and law firm salaries or working three jobs just to get by. It makes the city incredibly busy and focused. Diversity. Well over 800 languages are spoken here, and the dress, habits and food are from almost every world culture. As a gay man, I feel safer here than anywhere I've ever lived. Speaking of safety, NYC is the safest large city in the US and one of the safest large cities in the world. I walk around Manhattan, from Harlem to the Financial District, anytime night or day, and have never felt unsafe. It's a walking city. We don't own cars, and if we can't walk we use the trains. $2.75 and you can go anywhere, even to the beach. I ride trains almost every day. Crowded and not a great system compared to European systems, but it goes everywhere. You entertain out in the city. People do not have friends \u201cover\u201d very often, because apartments are so small. You meet in restaurants, bars, parks, etc. Oh, and the parks. Union Square. Washington Square, little Stuyvesant Park, Madison Square, the list is long and they are wonderful places to stop and rest and be entertained. And of course, Central Park. What's not to like? You can spend a whole Sunday afternoon there walking and eating and going to the zoo and being entertained for free. The weather is changeable, and there is snow in winter and humidity in the summer. But Spring and Fall are delightful. There are flowers everywhere and the breeze off the Hudson River in my neighborhood is sweet. Water. Rivers, beaches, long strolls along the seaport. Seagulls. NYC is surrounded by water. Food. It's the best. From food trucks to fine dining, you can find about everything here. Culture. Incredible museums (MOMA, Natural History, the Met, Whitney\u2026 ), you could never see it all. Wonderful small galleries. Opera, symphony, dance. And of course Broadway. Theater is just extraordinary. And the libraries: some are architectural gems as well as storehouses of knowledge. I\u2019ve lived in Charlotte, DC, Philadelphia and several smaller towns. But nothing (in this country) compares to NYC. I retired here (no Florida or resort condo for me), and I wake up every morning feeling incredibly fortunate to live here. And, yes, I do realize this answer is Manhattan-centric. And there are four more exciting and dynamic boroughs (well, maybe Staten Island\u2019s not exciting!). But, it's what I know. A word of advice: don't ever forget the expensive part. It\u2019s best to have a job in hand when you come to live here, and expect to work hard. I am fortunate to be retired, but most people work very hard to live here. Cheers!",

(I was eighteen at the time. The place was El Sombrero.)  A half-decent relationship.  My first good job.  The first time I ever got serious about helping people who were not me.   A place where I finally developed some self-confidence.   Then the bad:   The first time (of many) I ever seriously  questioned my existence on earth, and started to ask myself all of  those important, existential questions.     The first time I experienced innocent  people (that I knew) die from something so undeserved and so utterly  horrifying that I began to really wonder if doing good in the world  really mattered. The first place I began to understand  (but never be totally cognizant of) how totally privileged and enabled  I\u2019ve been my entire life and how most others aren\u2019t afforded that  incredible opportunity.  The first time I watched someone get  absolutely steamrolled by the stress and status-seeking that\u2019s become a  sad, inherent part of the New York culture. Some people can hang, and  they do well. But sometimes outsiders get chewed up and fist-fucked.   The first place where I seriously considered killing myself.  I couldn\u2019t hang, but stress wasn\u2019t the issue. I just wanted out.   New Yorkers Are Tough Whenever I mention to someone that I\u2019m from New York (I lived in New York City proper a year, sue me), they suggest that it\u2019s a  change of pace . This is a change of pace, right?  No shit .  But I also think the toughness thing is a bit of a misnomer, and kinda bullshit. (I wasn\u2019t very tough, admittedly.)   I think  coarse  is much more apt. Tough implies that you\u2019ve aged, like rock. You came up mica, and out the other side sapphire.   New Yorkers are rough, like #2 pencils \u2014  writing their jolly little notes in their Moleskine notepads, hoping  that they don\u2019t run out of graphite before they finish their thoughts.  Some people run out \u2014 of ideas, words,  hope. They can\u2019t write anymore. So they run on fumes. Or they kill  themselves. Or they move.  It\u2019s scary, and it\u2019s miserable and it\u2019s tough and you won\u2019t make it. Most people don\u2019t.  Nobody is happy. Everybody wants more.

We moved to luxury buildings that weren\u2019t overpriced compared to today\u2019s standards. I looked up a few of those buildings now and apartments go for 5 million. As a kid, it was expected that I\u2019d walk myself to school and back and to dance class, etc. Parents were more neglectful than helicopter back then. When I was a little older, I\u2019d visit apartments of kids my age who lived alone and snorted cocaine while maids nonchalantly dusted around them. I\u2019d ask where their parents were and they would wave their arms vaguely, saying: \u201cEurope.\u201d As a teen, I carried on an affair with my upstairs neighbor, I would say right under my super strict mother\u2019s nose, but technically it was right above her nose. I\u2019d walk the dog after school and take the back stairs up to his apartment. He\u2019d flick cigarettes over his penthouse balcony saying: \u201cI hope this lands in a baby carriage.\u201d He was joking, of course? There was no political correctness in those days. I hid my money amidst the trash under the back stairs radiator so my mother wouldn\u2019t find and confiscate it. I was panicked one day when I caught some guys actually cleaning back there. I asked them so many questions about their cleaning practices that I finally scared them away. I had friends, or should i say acquaintances, all over. This on account of the fact that my mother had started throwing me out of my apartment and I spent a lot of time wandering the streets, hanging out, and looking for places to stay. One day, I was walking down West 10th St. and I nodded to this drag queen (we used that term back then) named Kevin who was approaching me. He wore a military blazer that ended at his upper thighs. As we passed each other, he grabbed my hand and put it under his blazer, brushing it against his balls. I smiled and kept going. It was a New York moment. When AIDS started killing off a large part of the population, I felt the evil edge of New York that maybe only an insider experiences. People spoke about how \u2018electric\u2019 the place was, and I thought they were idiots. I was watching young, emaciated men on canes hobbling through the streets, talking about drug therapies that clearly weren\u2019t effective. \u2018Why don\u2019t people see that this is what New York does to its inhabitants?\u2019 I thought. Eventually, I moved to what is known as Upper Manhattan, Washington Heights. I\u2019d met my to-be husband, who was doing a fellowship at Columbia Presbyterian. Friends refused to visit me as the neighborhood had a bad rap. \u201cWhen are you coming into the city?\u201d They\u2019d ask. \u201cThis is the city,\u201d I\u2019d reply. \u201cWell, you know what I mean,\u201d they\u2019d say. I saw things in Washington Heights that you don\u2019t see downtown, such as pet chickens squawking on the streets and stray dogs openly fornicating. I started teaching in the Bronx around that time. Even though I was a teacher, I didn\u2019t actually respect my profession until I noticed that the only people who weren\u2019t talking about jail time and drug runs in the subway were the teachers and social workers who came into these vast ghettos to do good, while everyone else gravitated toward Wall Street and Money. This was part of my experience living in New York City. To end at the beginning, after being born there, I moved to Saigon, Vietnam during the war with my family. Whenever we\u2019d return, we\u2019d stay at the Croyden Hotel. I remember walking down the street as little girl and thinking, \u2018we have to come back and live here for good. This is the best city in the world.\u2019 And return there permanently we did! When the Croyden was converted into a residential apartment building, we moved there. I guess it was my dream come true. Then again, I never adjusted to the stress, noise, and over-population of the city, even though I grew up there. Also, I learned fear, fear of getting mugged (which happened enough times), fear of walking alone down dark , empty streets \u2026 fear followed me everywhere. New York - the good and the bad - a double-edged sword if ever there was one."

They are for keeps, and they need you, much more than they\u2019ll ever admit.It\u2019s often a thankless task. You will very likely hear \u201cI hate you!!!\u201d Don\u2019t let it get you down, and don\u2019t let it get you angry, and don\u2019t try to apologize and make them love you. Whatever you do, never repay it in kind. They will come to realize they never really hated you, they were just angry at the moment. But if you say it to them\u2026 they\u2019ll never forget that. It\u2019s best to say, \u201cI know, I know: I\u2019m the worst Mom/Dad in the world,\u201d as they stomp upstairs and slam the door.Toys are nice, but kids really need attention. Toys are no substitute for just being there for the kids and doing things together as a family.Be genuinely interested in what they\u2019re doing, but don\u2019t be a \u201cstage mom\u201d or butt in. Hardly anything turns a kid off more than knowing that Mom or Dad will dip their oar into whatever they\u2019re doing. Let them enjoy their own hobbies, etc., and be there to cheer them on when they\u2019re ready to show you what they\u2019ve done. Oh - and don\u2019t be surprised if their interests are not your own. (Corollary to #4: Don\u2019t live vicariously through your kid.)Be consistent. If you lay down a \u201cno foul language\u201d rule for your kids, and then use profanity yourself - especially in a casual way, like when hobnobbing with friends - that tells them that rules don\u2019t really apply. You will have absolutely no control over their behavior then. Control isn\u2019t everything; usually, minimal \u201ccontrol\u201d is best - but I\u2019m talking about a situation where you won\u2019t be able to take your child to a nice restaurant because he or she will swear like a sailor and think it\u2019s just funny when you try to stop them. If you lay down ground rules, they must apply to everyone, yourself included.Even infants communicate. Hold your newborn often, and get to know his or her sounds and body language. There will be distinct \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d \u201cI need attention,\u201d \u201cMy diaper\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m tired but there\u2019s too much fun\u201d cries; make sure they are addressed quickly. (This is not spoiling the baby; it\u2019s actually good for facilitating communication later; they\u2019ll be less likely to whine and act out.) \u201cToo much fun\u201d is best addressed by turning off the TV and dimming the lights - basically, reduce the outside stimulation so the baby will ease into nap mode more readily.Nap time? Place newborns on their backs. (\u201cBack to sleep\u201d is the mnemonic for this.) Sleeping on their tummies sometimes leads to suffocation. When they\u2019re able to roll themselves over in their sleep, then it\u2019s okay if they turn onto their tummies by themselves. Even if they\u2019re sleeping on your bosom, pay attention; babies have suffocated on chest hair and soft breasts. Oh - don\u2019t expect to get any work done while they sleep; that\u2019s about the only time you\u2019ll get to sleep yourself.Diaper time? Watch out - they like to save some ammo to squirt you in the eye. Be sure to apply some aloe lotion or even pop a Vitamin E oil caplet to rub on their little bums to prevent diaper rash. DR is no fun. If the baby feels wet, it\u2019s the diaper, not sweat. Sweat glands don\u2019t open until we\u2019re older. Keep that in mind on hot days; their bodies have a harder time adjusting to temperature extremes.Feeding time? As a La Leche baby, I may be prejudiced, but breast is generally best. If you\u2019re interested, look up \u201cLa Leche League\u201d to find your local chapter. (Your fellow Moms sometimes double as babysitters! Of course, expect to return the favor. You\u2019ll feel like a hippie, in the best possible way.)Sing! Babies love it. Tired of the Brahms\u2019 Lullaby? There are lullabies from all over the world to choose from; you can find them on the Interwebs. For a very beautiful one that\u2019s really obscure (and has no words to learn), look for a performance of Frederic Mompou\u2019s \u201cChanson de berceau\u201d (1951).Sing! Kids sorta love it. Great for car trips of any length. Feel free to do a faux-opera voice to make them giggle. Tired of the latest bubble-gum band? Turn on the Classical station. Don\u2019t be afraid to put silly lyrics to the music; it was meant to be enjoyed, after all! Mendelssohn: \u201cItalian\u201d symphony, 1st mvt: \u201cSpaghetti is ready, so eat, everyone! Ev\u2019ry cognoscenti knows al dente means that it\u2019s done.\u201d Violin concerto, 3rd mvt.: \u201cWe like bananas! We like bananas!\u201d \u2026and so much more. If you\u2019re not up on Classical, see if you know someone who is; chances are they\u2019ll know off-color lyrics for lots of catchy classics. Or ask Bugs Bunny.Sing! Teens hate it. It\u2019s a great way to get them to switch from speakers to headphones. Much more effective than \u201cTurn that racket down!\u201d, which has the opposite effect. (But give their music a listen. You don\u2019t have to like it, but it will give you insight as to where they\u2019re coming from. They\u2019ll turn out all right.)Let kids help set the rules when they are able to, especially as concerns chores and keeping one\u2019s room habitable. If they\u2019re kind of incorrigible, a good warning to issue is, \u201cIf I have to go in there while you\u2019re at school and clean it, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll want me finding your Playboy/ Playgirl magazines.\u201d (That usually scares \u2019em straight, and is more believable than the ol\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll rent a bulldozer\u201d line.)If you do have to go in there and find naughty magazines, leave \u2019em be. (They\u2019ll know you saw them anyway when they come back and can\u2019t find all the dirty laundry they\u2019d so artfully arranged everywhere, and the bedsheets are in the wash.) It\u2019s part of growing up. Just make sure they understand that girls are not really like that\u2026 and that boys are, but not as hunky or well-endowed as that. And if you find birth control\u2026 Just be glad they\u2019re taking precautions. Things could be much worse. It may be time for a good heart-to-heart talk. No yelling, screaming, crying, or \u201cI thought I raised you right\u201d. Please. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed; your Dad/Mom is taking it harder, but he\u2019ll/she\u2019ll come around, you\u2019ll see; I\u2019m glad you\u2019re at least using protection\u201d is all you have to say, and then listen to what your kid has to say. Really listen.When you\u2019ve had it up to here and feel like you\u2019re not getting anywhere, it may be time to have the grandparents spend time with the kids. Sometimes the generation gap needs to be a bit wider before it comes full-circle.Now that I\u2019ve adequately prepared you, let me state that nothing can adequately prepare you for parenthood. Let that be your Zen koan, your mantra. Be mindful and in-the-moment, and accept what happens. You\u2019ll do fine, and so will they. Maybe they\u2019ll even do a good job of raising you.Great book: How To Talk So Kids Will Listen (and Listen So Kids Will Talk), by Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish. There\u2019s a sequel (replace \u201cKids\u201d with \u201cTeens\u201d; but it\u2019s pretty much what I\u2019d expected - about the same, with an admission that teens are a little more independent and thus can be harder to work with.",

[Note: I had TONS of milk, this was not the problem] So start by giving her one bottle, and then two, etc. In the meantime keep nursing and your milk will slowly dry up.\u201d This was a revelation - I had no clue you could do BOTH breast and bottle! I immediately bought formula and watched happily as Baby\u2019s dad gave her a bottle. When we were able to go to two bottles a day, to my great surprise and relief I found we\u2019d hit the sweet spot. I continued to nurse 4x a day, and Dad did two bottles.

Baby got full-up on formula at bedtime and slept better, Mommy got a break from nursing and some desperately-needed \u201cme time.\u201d I have told every expectant parent I\u2019ve known ever since that you can do both things at once.

I recently read about mercury poisoning where a grandmother fed an infant mercury, because \u2018she knew best\u2019 and that\u2019s what her Alternate medicine practitioner told her.  Kids need most of your time, energy, attention and money. Spend a week with someone who has kids and then decide if you are ready for the plunge. There\u2019s no way out! Your small child emulates you, learns from you, imitates you and worships you. So, learn to behave. Try getting your life into shape before you start creating life. If you smoke, try quitting. If you drink too much, cut it down. If you have anger issues, sort them. If you are repaying student loans and home loans, don\u2019t think of having kids. You cannot have children and weed weekends all at once. It\u2019s ok to admit that you don\u2019t have time for career, children, work and health altogether. I know of Doctors and premier MBAs who have taken breaks from career because they wanted to spend time with kids. At the same time, don\u2019t judge. The mum/dad who work and raise kids are just as good as the ones who stay at home or take a step back in career to raise kids. One is not better than the other. Don\u2019t judge. A friend might raise her child vegan. One might go for all kinds of processed and packaged store bought foods. It\u2019s ok! Moderation is key. Don\u2019t overdo anything and you will be fine. Think of how your spouse or partner would fare as a parent. If you think she/he will help around with every task (not just parenting), go ahead. If you don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work, have a chat with him/her. You can choose to outsource house work. But be on the same page about this decision. Can you afford kids? If you think you can\u2019t, don\u2019t go ahead. Do not think of grandparents as unpaid babysitters, nannies and housekeepers. They might say yes to entice you into parenthood (Sorry, that\u2019s India for you) but you might get into loggerheads later on. Draw boundaries and ensure you don\u2019t stress them out or depend way too much on parents and grandparents having to compromise on things that matter. Giving birth is a traumatic process, physically and mentally. For months together, you will be leaking fluids from several orifices. You will have mood swings. You will be sleep starved. You will lose mental peace over small issues. Post part in depression is very real and women experience it in varying grades. Learn to recognise the signs. Ensure you don\u2019t lose your own self in becoming a parent. Take a break if you can! Don\u2019t judge or be judged. Happy parenting!",

And to start, I\u2019m going to ask another question: What is perfection? The word \u201cperfection\u201d gets thrown around often, even though it\u2019s actually pretty rare. I think perfection in the typical, truly flawless sense is nearly impossible to find. Everything has some sort of flaw (although ironically, many of the things I casually describe as \u201cperfect\u201d are so lovable because of their supposed flaws). Either way, perfection as it\u2019s supposed to signify doesn\u2019t exist. The world is just too fundamentally flawed. We\u2019re all too careless. Humans are violent, hateful even. We\u2019re suffering physically and mentally, and we\u2019re lost in a sea of systems that maybe were supposed to make the world better at one point, but really just add to our suffering; capitalism, most world governments, and all the prejudice baked into nearly every part of our lives. But what if it wasn\u2019t like that? What if there was a world without violence, conflict, or hate, a world where everyone\u2019s just\u2026better? We call that Utopia.I still stand by my opinion that Answer is Ateez\u2019s best song; with its celebratory grandiosity and callbacks to their previous work, the song\u2019s sheer triumphant power blows me away every time I hear it. And for a while, Answer was my favorite as well; I\u2019d still rank it as my favorite title track, although Say My Name\u2019s musical storytelling is way up there as well. But currently, my favorite is Utopia, the first track on their third mini-album, Treasure EP.3- One To All.What\u2019s notable about this era of Ateez is just how happy the songs are. Wave, the title track of the mini-album, is tropical house, Aurora is a sweet dedication to Atinys, Illusion is bright and silly, and Dancing Like Butterfly Wings is a gigantic, joyful sing-along. But starting the mini-album is, of course, Utopia. When I think of songs I consider perfect, they\u2019re songs that achieve their goals. They\u2019re songs that have an idea of the mood they want to set, and through their production, composition, lyrics, and vocal performances, they accomplish every goal with flying colors. (A lot of the songs I\u2019ve discussed in-depth are like this.) In Utopia, Ateez and their producers aim to capture the idea of dreaming big, never losing hope, and believing that they can reach this perfect world. What\u2019s fascinating about the sound of Utopia is how, instead of sounding like a lot of the typical \u201csummer songs\u201d in kpop (tropical house like the aforementioned Wave or Twice\u2019s Dance The Night Away, or dance pop like Red Velvet\u2019s Umpah Umpah or Sistar\u2019s Touch My Body), the track\u2019s production actually reminds me more of synthwave than anything. With those kinds of synths, especially the synth bass sound, I could easily imagine a slower version of this song on a night drive playlist.Yet, Utopia\u2019s sound is pure sunshine. It sounds like diving into the pure blue ocean water, screaming along on my family\u2019s jet ski, and letting the golden sun\u2019s rays touch my skin. With its urgently excited vocal refrain of \u201cEVERY DAY! EVERY NIGHT! LET US GO, GO, GO!\u201d, laid-back guitar in the verses, and shimmering synths, Utopia is propulsive, uplifting, and full of so much joy. As is the case with so many Ateez songs I love, the song progresses beautifully. I think my favorite part of the production is the bridge, which is a balanced middle ground; not as low-key as the verses, not as high-energy as the chorus, just\u2026perfect. Props to Eden, Leez, and Buddy, three of Ateez\u2019s most frequent collaborators, for this song\u2019s scintillating production. I think Utopia is quite possibly the most universally appealing song in Ateez\u2019s discography- no matter who you stan or what musical styles and concepts you prefer, the rapturous optimism in every element of this song will probably make you smile. It\u2019s bright without being overly saccharine. It has a message and connects to the group\u2019s lore, but you don\u2019t need to be an expert in the lore to enjoy it. It progresses, changes, and has layers to its production, but it\u2019s not \u201cexperimental\u201d or off-putting. Most importantly, it was a song I loved right off the bat. I have nothing against songs that take a while to grow on me (Ateez themselves have a few of those in their discography), but it feels like every new song is a \u201cgrower\u201d at this point. Whatever happened to songs that people like on the first listen?The absolute highlight of Utopia, at least for me, is its post-chorus. After Jongho finishes belting, we hear a series of high, wordless, absolutely beautiful vocalizations that most people would probably expect to be Jongho again. But no, it\u2019s none other than Seonghwa, sounding like an angelic siren of a man. (Please note that I mean \u201csiren\u201d as in the mythological creatures, not an ambulance.) For me, a huge part of how I\u2019m Seonghwa-biased, how I appreciate him, is that I spend a lot of time being proud of him, typically because I find his confidence glow-up so inspiring. But can you blame me? The guy auditioned as a rapper and used to be really insecure about singing for people, but now he can do that, and he consistently does it live, too. Seonghwa, sweetie, you\u2019re doing amazing.I honestly think Ateez are kind of underrated vocally. I don\u2019t think Jongho\u2019s underrated at all; even if you don\u2019t love his vocal color, he\u2019s the high-belting, ballad-loving, apple-breaking power vocalist of this generation, he delivers nearly every time, and you\u2019d be foolish to deny that. However, with all the (deserved) hype Jongho gets, people don\u2019t always appreciate how nice everyone else sounds. I love Yunho\u2019s soft, floaty voice in the intro, and I love how they contrast his tone with Yeosang\u2019s lower, but still pleasant, tone in the second verse. In a lot of Ateez\u2019s songs, San\u2019s sharing lines with Jongho, and while Jongho\u2019s vocal style is dramatic and powerful, San has this higher, sort of boyish tone that I love. I adore the way San sings \u201cdon\u2019t tell me that\u2019s true no more, yeah\u201d in the pre-chorus. I love how Wooyoung sings \u201ceveryday, every night, here we go, go, go\u201d before the production really explodes into the chorus. And of course, Jongho nails every line, especially the big, melancholy-tinged belts at the song\u2019s outro. I love Hongjoong and Mingi\u2019s raps just as much. The \u201chigh-voiced rapper/deep-voiced rapper pairing\u201d trope isn\u2019t groundbreaking, but the sheer variety and energy in Hongjoong\u2019s flows, contrasted with Mingi\u2019s deep, metallic hype-man flair just always does it for me. They both do really well here, not just in their verses, but the chanting of \u201cWE CAN TOUCH! U-TO-PIA! WE CAN REACH THERE! U-TO-PIA!\u201d in between Seonghwa\u2019s high notes is probably the catchiest part of the song. Hongjoong also has another one of my absolute favorite moments in the song- his warm, patient delivery of the line \u201cI\u2019m sure that we will find someday\u201d really represents what the song is about. I really don\u2019t think we can ever reach a perfect world. To be fair, the utopia that they want to reach isn\u2019t even in our reality; it\u2019s all Ateez\u2019s lore. But when I listen to this song, I believe that we can reach paradise. This song absolutely sparkles with optimism. In every vocal choice, every lyric, every production element, there is hope, a force that will never die. Jongho belts out what translates to \u201cEven if everyone laughs because it\u2019s a dream I can\u2019t stop, the truth to me is that\u2026\u201d followed by Hongjoong and Mingi reassuring that they can touch and reach utopia. It\u2019s a song of joy, confidence, and conviction.While Utopia by Ateez isn\u2019t the only kpop song I see as \u201cperfect,\u201d it made sense to write this answer about it because it is explicitly about finding perfection. Even moreso, it\u2019s about setting goals and desires, feeling excited because those dreams are coming close. That\u2019s quite literally what I said that \u201cperfect\u201d songs do! I plan to do some traveling this summer, and as I look out and as I ride along the ocean, with my heart pounding from the excitement, Utopia will be the only song playing in my head. It will be perfect.And scene.",

Here\u2019s the kicker: he had the money to spend on plane fare. He just didn\u2019t want to. A$$hole that he was. So, his grandfather, who was around 90, had said that he\u2019d put the check in the mail. It hadn\u2019t arrived, due to the holiday mail delay. I bore witness to this guy browbeating his elderly grandpa into Fed-Exing another check over the phone. This was two days before the cut-off date to book the flight. So his grandfolks sent another check, because they wanted their grandson home for the holidays. These were old, frail people who barely got out of the house. Not good drivers. You know, why didn\u2019t my S.O. just pay for the fare and let his grandfather pay him back once he was there? A day or so after he left on the trip, his grandfather\u2019s original check arrived in the mail. I looked at his spidery handwriting on the signature line, and I felt positively ill. I ended up breaking up with my significant other because of that, and for countless other times that I\u2019d seen him be really mean to other people who loved him\u2014family members, even. I knew that one day, I could be next in line, and I wasn\u2019t about to wait around for that to happen.",

I have a son and a younger daughter, and I have raised them alone since their mother died of cancer. They both have strong morals. My son and his sister love each other and he would drive her to school and wait for her to leave school whenever she was late. My son was one of the top students in engineering (average grade 94%). One girl -who was one year below him in engineering- was terrible at math. Math is essential in engineering. So she had to make a close relationship with my son to use him for his math skills. He devoted half his time teaching her math. She became his girlfriend and that was wonderful. But she then convinced him that she had no money and her family lived in a different province of Canada. So he kindly asked me to take her in our house for all free residence and living cost. I did agree feeling a welcomed girlfriend. But, when the girlfriend moved in our house, he stopped driving his sister from and to school. I didn't have time to do that because of my job and I tried to investigate if his girlfriend is provoking him against his sister. Of course, she denied that she was pushing him to not care about his sister. In brief, she stayed with us for almost 3 years for free accommodation and free meals. When she graduated a mechanical engineer (B-Sc), my son was in his final semester of Master's degree. Before she started to look for a job, she noticed that he got a generous (all paid) scholarship from the Canadian federal government to Kyoto university in Japan to finish his masters in IC-design. So she played her final card for more abuse. Because she was interested in a free vacation in Japan, so she told him that she will miss him for 4 months as he will be in Japan and cried to take her to Japan. He paid for her air ticket from the generous government money. She stayed with him in his university dormitory and both tried to make his scholarship money enough for their expenses in Japan. So he sacrificed a lot of his money to support her in Japan. As he finished his studies in Japan and came back home with her, she didn't need him anymore. Then, the truth is about to reveal itself. She immediately dumped my son and told him how disgusted she was by his father and his sister. Evidently, she has hated me and my daughter. At least, that was our reward for giving her free accommodation and food as well as helping her with her math problems. Without his help in maths, she would never graduate a mechanical engineer. As a gratitude to our act of kindness, she considered me and my daughter disgusting, and left my son broken hearted in spite of his sacrifices. Edit:- Three years passed, he still doesn't trust all girls. Girls who are following him get frustrated by his distrust of them. I am very sad for him. Edit 2: wow! 12k votes and over 190 comments and listed twice in Quora digest. I just want to thank everyone and I am sorry for not being able to answer everyone for being busy. I just want to clarify one thing for those who resource to aggressiveness or retaliation. Everyone of us might have been in a similar situation. For me as a father who wrote this story, I don't have a grudge against her. In fact, I am happy that I helped someone in need. The only one thing that really bothered me at the time is her despise to my daughter to the point where she boldly tried all means to push a brother against his sister. We never obligated her to do any chores at home. When she left with contempt, she took all the small presents (like FM transmitter for his car) and some birthday presents that she gave him. I remember that I only sent her one email reminding her of his expensive gifts like diamond earrings. She never answered me, but, instead, she came home one day to return her gifts to him.

He told me that the mate was ill. The two were heading to the hospital, when he (the sick man) collapsed and couldn't walk due to the pain. I asked the crowd if they were willing to make a quick contribution. I wanted someone to chip in so that we could get a Taxi to rush the man to the hospital. Ambulances here are a novelty, especially to the poorer masses. Nobody stepped forward to help. Some people called me gullible. A lump formed in my throat, I wanted to cry out of frustration. The sheer lack of empathy from the voyeuristic crowd was infuriating. I asked them what the were milling around for if they couldn't help the man. Sneers greeted me. I realised that I had to help. I walked to a cash machine, withdrew enough money for a taxi and hospital admittance. I asked the ill man\u2019s friend to help him up, he took one arm while I took the other, and we walked his friend to the Taxi bay. None of the bystanders was willing to help with this either. The man had been lying on the ground, and as such his clothes had gathered dirt. None of the Taxi men that we approached were willing to drive him to the hospital. A handful of them said the same thing. He looks like a drunkard! I attested to the fact that there wasn't a whiff of alcohol on the man. Furthermore, the taxi didn't have to worry about non-payment issues, since I would foot the bill. No one offered to help the sick man, who was by now crying like a small child. My mother joined in to support his frail body. Exasperated, I walked to the last, unwilling, taxi driver. I implored, with tears welling up in my eyes, to his moral conscience. He agreed: on condition that the man didn't throw up in the taxi, and I had to pay half of the fare upfront. I obliged. Paid half, gave the rest of the ill man\u2019s friend. Who took the money, and with tears in his eyes gave me 10000 blessings. I told him to thank you for standing by his friend and wished them well. As soon as the taxi drove off, I collapsed into my mother\u2019s arms and cried\u2014bitter hot tears. I cried for the man. I wasn't sure he would survive the night. I cried for my country. Many people die without the right emergency treatment or availability of ambulances. Above all, my tears were of anger. I was angry at how people can be voyeuristic around a sick, dying or hurting person, apathetic to their his/her pain. Ps: This isn't a humblebrag.

Sometimes life closes doors because it\u2019s time to move forward.  And that\u2019s a good thing because we often won\u2019t move unless circumstances force us to.  When times are tough, remind yourself that no pain comes without a purpose.  Move on from what hurt you, but never forget what it taught you.

Stay patient and stay positive.  Everything is going to come together; maybe not immediately, but eventually. Remember that there are two kinds of pain: pain that hurts and pain that changes you.  When you roll with life, instead of resisting it, both kinds help you grow 2.  Everything in life is temporary. Every time it rains, it stops raining.  Every time you get hurt, you heal.  After darkness there is always light \u2013 you are reminded of this every morning, but still you often forget, and instead choose to believe that the night will last forever.  It won\u2019t.  Nothing lasts forever. 3.  Worrying and complaining changes nothing. Those who complain the most, accomplish the least.  It\u2019s always better to attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.  It\u2019s not over if you\u2019ve lost; it\u2019s over when you do nothing but complain about it.  If you believe in something, keep trying.  4.  Your scars are symbols of your strength. Don\u2019t ever be ashamed of the scars life has left you with.  A scar means the hurt is over and the wound is closed.  It means you conquered the pain, learned a lesson, grew stronger, and moved forward.  A scar is the tattoo of a triumph to be proud of.  Don\u2019t allow your scars to hold you hostage.  Don\u2019t allow them to make you live your life in fear.  You can\u2019t make the scars in your life disappear, but you can change the way you see them 5. The best thing you can do is to keep going. Don\u2019t be afraid to get back up \u2013 to try again, to love again, to live again, and to dream again.  Don\u2019t let a hard lesson harden your heart.  Life\u2019s best lessons are often learned at the worst times and from the worst mistakes.  There will be times when it seems like everything that could possibly go wrong is going wrong.  And you might feel like you will be stuck in this rut forever, but you won\u2019t.  When you feel like quitting, remember that sometimes things have to go very wrong before they can be right.  Sometimes you have to go through the worst, to arrive at your best. If the grass looks greener on the other side\u2026  Stop staring.  Stop comparing.

I created another one and sent over 200 emails trying to get some business. Didn\u2019t work out. If I wanted it, it simply wasn\u2019t going to work in my favor. \u2013 I often wonder when in situations like that what in the world is going on. It\u2019s situations like those that can leave you feeling absolutely desperate. And more than the feeling, really desperate. Your money runs out. You can\u2019t do the things you need to do. You can\u2019t move. You can\u2019t go anywhere. Everything you do fails. All you were trying to do was make your life better, so why isn\u2019t it happening? It makes no sense. The only thing you\u2019re trying not to do is fail \u2013 and that\u2019s the only thing that works out. You fail. \u2013 The cliche is \u201csomething better will work out\u201d and people will tell you, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be fine. You always are.\u201d But how do you know that and why should you believe that? I know that because I just trust that things are going to work out. God is good. Sometimes failure isn\u2019t failing at all but succeeding from not seeing the bigger picture. I don\u2019t know that to be 100% correct, but I\u2019ll give you some examples of why I think that. \u2013 I really wanted this house in the Cape. It was a nice house. On the canal. It had a pool. It reminded me of my old house in the Cape and all the things I lost. I thought, \u201cif I can just get this house in the Cape, my life will start returning to normal. I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019ve put the past behind me and am moving on.\u201d I didn\u2019t get the house \u2013 and it\u2019s a good thing for 2 reasons. 1. I was let go from my job only weeks later. Had I got the house, I would have risked the chance of losing the house \u2013 another house \u2013 because I had no income. 2. The house I eventually did get is only 4 doors down from my old house \u2013 the one I lost. And I love it. It\u2019s got a pool. It\u2019s got a dock. It\u2019s on the same canal. My canal.I didn\u2019t see either one of those things coming. Not in a million years. Who would have guessed. Here\u2019s another: I met all those girls. This one here, that one there. I was all over town for a time. I liked them all. I thought them and I could make a pretty solid run at it. And then they each said the one word I hate above all others: GD. Never thought any of them would say it. I mean, I curse like a sailor, but I\u2019m not touching that one. I hear that all the time. I don\u2019t need to hear it from someone I\u2019m with. No love loss here. Those girls were not the girls for me. But there\u2019s one out there somewhere and eventually \u2026 \u2013 I take a long view on things. Mostly. I don\u2019t do it when I\u2019m desperate. Out of money. Scared I\u2019m not going to have food or a place to live. But even in those times, what can I do? I think if you take the long view that you have a better chance at making it through the short term problems. Joel says, \u201cis this a 5 year, 5 month, 5 week, 5 hour or 5 minute problem?\u201d That\u2019s a pretty good way to look at it. My mom used to sing that song, \u201cOne day at a time, Sweet Jesus, that\u2019s all I\u2019m asking from you\u201d. I like that too. \u2013 When you\u2019ve done everything you can and nothing you do works out, stop. I know it\u2019s not easy but you have to settle down and let things just kind of go the way they are going to go. You\u2019ve got no control anyhow. Right? No matter how much you try and how hard you press, what will be will be. You don\u2019t have enough information. Don\u2019t give up \u2013 and keep pushing forward, but trust. Just trust. You really haven\u2019t failed. It\u2019s just, you don\u2019t really know the better things that are coming. And good things are coming."

My wife is an EU citizen. I live in the UK but have homes in Tuscany and Prague. Until very recently, I lived in a very affluent part of London. I now live in an equally affluent part of the Home Counties. It shouldn't surprise anyone, considering my circumstances, that I voted Remain and continue to hope we remain part of the EU. What might be surprising, given the the tenor of comments written here by some Remainers, is that I have a great deal of sympathy for the British working class and in particular the 'white' British working class who voted Brexit. I read too often, comments on Quora that are so disparaging about such people, describing them with words such as 'ignorant', 'racist', 'xenophobe' or 'duped'. Not only are such comments hateful and bigoted, they are irrational and display a staggering lack of empathy. Despite my current good fortune, I actually grew up in a poor, 'white', working class town in the north of England (the vote there was well over 60% for Leave). That's where my empathy comes from. Those 'white' working class, Brexit-voting 'knuckle-draggers' one sees insulted so often on Quora are people I grew up with. People I still see as friends. Not long before the vote, I returned to my old home-town for a funeral. I met with large crowd of my old friends and was astonished that virtually every one of them had rejected the Labour party utterly (despite most of them, including me, being Labour party members in our younger years) and most were enthusiastic supporters of UKIP. Over a few drinks, I tried gently to persuade my friends that the EU was, for all its faults, a net benefit for them. It was a very long conversation and by the end of it, I realised that like so many 'middle class' Remainers, I was utterly ignorant of how massive immigration affects poor, working class communities. Let's consider my life at the time of the vote. My house at the time was on a private estate where property prices are in \u00a3millions rather than the hundreds or even tens of thousands of pounds property in my old home town costs. Living among the well-off English professionals in my street were Iraqi doctors, an Egyptian fine art dealer, a Romanian derivatives trader with his lawyer French wife. A Swedish couple lived behind - lawyers again. And of course, my wife and me. So, a very 'diverse' area. One of my old school friends is a laboratory technician. His wife is a nurse. He bought his 3-bedroom terraced house 20-odd years ago. Houses in his street cost around \u00a3200,000. In the last decade or so, his street has also become very 'diverse'. At one time, I would have described the streets we both live in as equally 'diverse' and thought that a good and 'enriching' thing. That was before actually speaking to someone who experiences 'diversity' in a way people like me never have. I\u2019ve come to realise that neighbourhoods like mine aren't 'diverse' in any meaningful sense. Yes, many of us are born abroad, speak other languages and possess different complexions. However, we are all 'middle class' professionals. We all speak perfect English. We attend dinner parties in each other's homes. Our children play together. To all intents and purposes, we're very similar in terms of culture and values. We have a 'community'. Most of my friend's neighbours don't speak much English. The Poles are mostly young men in multi-occupancy house-shares. The Romanians are from the Roma community. According to my friend, they appear not to work and congregate in the street drinking noisily into the early hours. The many Bangladeshi families (including his next-door neighbours) are very insular. The women speak little or no English. Some of their children have told my friend's children that they \"aren't allowed to play with English kids\". And despite my friend's wife's efforts to invite neighbours or set up play-dates, there is absolutely no 'mixing' in my friend's street. There is no 'community'. Just parallel societies. House prices in my old street are still rising nicely. In my friend's street, they've been falling for the last few years. Since my conversation, I\u2019ve been considering how immigration was affecting our respective areas. In my old affluent part of London, it was noticeable that the artisan bakeries, coffee shops, wine bars and delicatessens seemed to employ more attractive and motivated staff. Mainly from Eastern Europe. In my friend's area, there has been a proliferation of run-down, halal grocers. However, I did notice that the local Pizza Express and pubs seem to have also benefited from attractive and motivated South and East European staff. However, my children will never need to compete for a job in an artisan bakery or wine bar. My friend's children on the other hand, do need to compete for such work. 20 years ago, my English cleaner cost \u00a310 per hour. 20 years later, my harder working Ukrainian cleaner costs the same. 20 years ago, an English plumber would cost me \u00a3200. 20 years later, I can get an equally good Polish plumber for less. That's great for me. Not good for English cleaners and Plumbers. 20 years ago, my \u2018trainee\u2019 office junior would be an immature, often unreliable 17-year-old English kid. My last \u2018junior\u2019 was a smart, confident, emotionally mature 25-year-old Pole. Great for employers. Not so good for fairly low-skilled, usually working class 17-year-old English \u2018first-jobbers\u2019. During the conversation, I pointed out that since 1997, we've had more immigration from outside the EU. Leaving wouldn't change the fact that my friend's street and area has changed so much. The reply was that 1 million non-EU immigrants had just forced their way into Europe. That the EU was not preventing this. That it would continue. And that a fair proportion of those non-EU immigrants would end up in the UK. I laughed and said it was a stretch. Then, my friends told me about a story in the local newspaper. A Somali family had, after only 9 months in the country, received 2 brand new housing association homes knocked into one (there were 11 children). I said that leaving the EU wouldn't affect asylum. \"But the family came from Holland, with Dutch passports!\" was the reply. Regardless of the fact that such occurrences are probably statistically insignificant, people like me will never lose sleep over stories like this. Neither I, nor my children, will ever need a housing association property. But for many poorer, working class people, I do understand how upsetting such stories are. The answer to all of this? I'm not sure there is one. My intent isn't to attack any group or to attack immigration. It is only to ask people to think before they disparage the 'white' working class as a bunch of 'xenophobes' and 'racists'. Try to imagine yourself in their shoes. And finally, to the immigrants (like me) and EU citizens (like my wife) who say the same, I'll ask you a sincere question: How do you think the people of your homeland would generally feel and react if in only a few years, your ethnic group became a minority in your homeland\u2019s capital city, as the English have become in London? Please, think carefully and answer honestly. And pray the worst outcome would be as mild as Brexit. Addendum I feel humbled - in 3 days, my first ever comment on Quora has received over 2000 upvotes. It is my sincere hope that some who read this will have gained a more sympathetic perspective, as I did, toward those poorer, white, working class people who are dismissed so casually, by so many, as 'racists' and 'xenophobes'. Cocooned in my comfortable world, I felt all the benefits of immigration. The negative aspects were just statistics. When I read about the numbers of immigrants who didn't speak English, the 'parallel' societies springing up, the anti social issues etc. my interest - albeit fairly limited as it was - concerned mainly the immigrants themselves. For example, the detrimental effect it would have on their life chances and those of their children. I also felt a little irritated, as an immigrant myself, that it was giving immigration a bad name. I never thought about how it must be to watch your street and neighbourhood becoming steadily transformed by that type of immigration. The immigrant and ethnic minority population in my old home town is still relatively low compared to places like London and most of my other 'Brexit voting' friends there live in streets that are still predominantly 'white' working class. However, it is clear to me that what has happened to my friend's street and neighbourhood frightens them all. This has clearly been going on for years and people like me have been dismissing the complaints of such people, assuming their motivations were \u2018xenophobia\u2019 and 'racism'. For that I am deeply ashamed. When I arrived in the UK as a young child, barely able to speak English, people like my white, working class friends defended me against the usually ignorant (and sometimes just racist) people who would call me 'Paki' etc. I now feel it is the duty of people like me to advocate for people like them. No one else is. For my final point on this I\u2019ll use an analogy in the hope it will resonate with those Remainers who, in my opinion, caused our side to lose the Referendum with the facile and lazy assumption that Leavers were motivated by bovine racism and xenophobia: There are some out there who describe all Muslims as \u2018extremists\u2019 and/or \u2018terrorist-supporters\u2019. As well as being bigoted and stupid, the irony is that such generalisations make everything worse. First the terms become devalued and meaningless. That means the real extremists and terrorist-supporters are able to blend in with the overwhelming majority of Muslims who are utterly opposed to extremism and terrorism. Ultimately and ironically, such hateful essentialism may serve to push some otherwise peaceful and tolerant Muslims into feeling so misunderstood, hated and marginalised that they're more likely to embrace extremism. That\u2019s what it is when people use terms like \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018xenophobe\u2019 so liberally toward people they know so little about. It is hate speech, nothing less.",

If you want to understand this issue very easily, just watch the BBC video I linked at the bottom. If you want to actually do some of the reading, and possibly get a laugh out of it at the same time, then read the rest of my scribblings. So this issue is very easy to understand if you are working class and British. Britain has always been a class society, and the worries that assail the working classes, simply do not affect the upper and middle-class bourgeoisie. It\u2019s weird, because most working class people are very socially liberal. Talk to a plumber in the pub, and he is probably totally uninterested in banning gay marriage, or going to war, or banning sensible migration. Indeed, by now, most working class lads socialize with at least a few Polish blokes. I used to work with a few, and I played footy with a Romanian lad. Stick working class Europeans in a boozer and they will get on fine. They will certainly find they have much more in common than they would with someone like Frau Merkel or Jean Claude Juncker. Or, if I had to pick some random British Remainers, the likes of Owen Jones, the staggeringly privileged Laurie Penny, or the wonderfully shortsighted and always hilarious, Afua Hirsch. But when it comes to the EU, working class people are appalled by it for three obvious reasons. First of all, we like to hold our leaders accountable. We like bottom-up, village council style democracy. We like to go to the local Town Hall and have a good go at the effete, upper-class elites that laud it over us.\u201cAye Ive got a question.. why has our town been on fire for three years?\u201dHow can we do that with the even more aloof, even further away, and even less accountable, European Commission!? Secondly, because the center and far-left that support Remain, are demonstrably privileged. They also can\u2019t see that several of the groups they love with their intersectional nonsense are diametrically opposed to each other (the LGBT and Muslim communities are just one example.) And thirdly, and perhaps most obviously, because the working classes have eyes, ears, and long memories. Brexit was about much, much more than just immigration. It was about accountability, it was about democracy, it was about feeling as if the people that rule over you actually give a damn about your concerns. But as the left want to just pretend that this all revolves around immigration, while slurring and insulting tens of millions of people as they do so, lets deal squarely with that single issue once and for all. My hometown, which famously takes lot of migrants in (because no rich people live there) has been absolutely decimated by immigration.\u201cBecause the Somalians and the Afghans prefer the war-zones!\u201dWhen Frau Merkel unilaterally decided to let millions of fighting age men into Europe, do you think she had to wait 6 weeks for her next doctors appointment because there was 600 Afghans on the waiting list? My dad does. Do you think famous British SJWs like JK Rowling or Lilly Allen will even see any of the people they spend so much time worrying over? Will Joanne suddenly have massive gangs of Kurdish and Iraqi men staving each others heads in on her front lawn when she comes back from Waitrose? They do in Middlesbrough. A (working class) Pakistani taxi driver was telling me that \u201ca load of Kurds have turned up and they try to take our women\u201d and they are literally fighting them in the streets. I laughed and then saw this story 6 months later. 'Biggest ever' NCA operation to tackle Tees people smuggling gang. Just listen to the working classes, they can tell you what is going on! Or do you think no recent or foreign born migrants voted for Brexit? I beg to differ. The working classes voted for it. And more of them are poor and from foreign backgrounds, than any collection of upper-class toffs the BBC want to point us towards! Just look at the shortsightedness of the elites. Remember when George Clooney argued for letting unvetted migrants into England, then when a load of wiry foreign men showed up, he was in fear for his kids safety and buggered off back to America?!\u201cGee whiz Amal, who\u2019d have thought a gang of poorly educated fighting age third-world men would be against the LGBTQQ+ community?!\u201dRich people never have to worry about the largest concerns for normal people, so they are free to virtue signal on the internet. I am a normal human, I have empathy for others, and I get a twinge of sadness when I hear about poor people, be they from Somalia, Slovakia, or anywhere else. But I don\u2019t care about them as much as I care about poor people in Middlesbrough. We care more about our friends and neighbors than we do random strangers from halfway across the world. In what way is that illogical? Here is a story that made me angry, try and put yourself in the shoes of the parent in this tale. When I was a kid growing up in Boro, I remember having really bad ear-ache. My mam rang the doctor because I was crying in pain, I think I was only about 5. In those days, the doc used to literally show up at your house, the same day. Four hours later, a fat amiable doctor with a bushy beard walked in, gave me an examination in the living room, sorted my mother out with some drugs, gave me a pat on the head, and left. Now, last year my mate told me his kid had ear-ache. It reminded me of how much pain I was in when I was a kid. Funny thing, it didn\u2019t go down the same way.\u201cStop crying you selfish little bastard, there\u2019s a faceless 26 year old stranger in Eritrea having a bad week!\u201dHe said he couldn't get an appointment at all, not that day, not the next day. They told him he had to wait until the next week. The kid was howling, so he got on Google, tried to deal with it himself, and then went to Superdrug and bought a ton of things to try and assuage the issue. By the time his appointment rolled around, he didn't need it any longer. So think about that.. a young mother, who has a child they love more than anything in the world, and the child is howling in agony. The young mother is old enough to remember when she was young, and the doctor actually showed up when she needed them. Do you think she, as she nurtures her crying child, is going to go \u201cHey you know what we need? We need to help random strangers from all four corners of the globe!\u201d Or is she going to go \u201cscrew this!\u201d If a politician (wealthy) or some famous footballer or author or pop star (wealthy) has a problem, they can quickly and easily fix it with the vast resources at their disposal. If their neighborhood becomes a dump, they can move. If their kids are crying, they pay a top physician to be there within the hour. They don\u2019t need to worry about:Finding a jobState owned housingSeeing an NHS doctor or dentistGetting a place for their kids in a state-schoolCriminals outside their doorsI could probably think of a dozen other issues that screw the working classes of any comparatively wealthy country when they open the doors to poor ones, but its trivially easy to see. Obviously it was wonderful for poor Somalians and Afghans when they opened the doors to Europe, of course it was. But what did poor British people get out of it? Can anyone name me even one thing?\u201cStandard group of migrants to Europe = less tits than One Direction.\u201dThey talk about \u201ccultural enrichment\u201d being one. Well, we got new cuisine and music and fashion off the first 500 Afghans, what did we need 10,000 more for? Lads in council estates in the Boro, they can\u2019t even move. If they neighborhood and community goes completely to pot, they can do absolutely nothing about it. They have to stay where they are because they can\u2019t get another council house, there\u2019s a 6 year waiting list. The burden hasn\u2019t been shared. The rich do not get affected by mass-migration. They live in a gated community, have their every whim catered for, and if the worst happens, quickly bugger off to Monaco. But the poor completely get shagged by it. They are stuck where they live, their community is all they have, and it is all they will ever have. It is a simple argument, between the anywheres and the somewheres.So it\u2019s like the old quote about an English breakfast. The upper and middle-class are chickens, the poor and unknown are pigs. The chicken is involved, but the pig is committed!",

I cannot think of a British born HGV driver under the age of 35 now. It is no longer a career that British workers seem to be interested in. Personally, I joined a company in 2005 and left in 2014. In those seven years my gross hourly rate for night work increased by just 40 pence, or half of one per cent per year for seven years. There has been an abundance of Polish drivers (most of whom I get on well with and really like) who are prepared to work hard for whatever they are offered. As long as that is the case there will be no reason for employers to pay any more than they already are. So is the influx of foreign drivers the cause of the shortage of British drivers, or is the shortage of British drivers the cause of all the foreign drivers being here? I believe that many voters would have decided which way to vote according to how they answered this question.",

I am a working class Londoner (born 1956 in Holloway LB Islington) but now early retired, I live in a Norfolk seaside town. It is the older working class who have seen decades of fundamental changes to UK life which has resulted in all of our public services being stretched to breaking point. In this corner of the East of England (Great Yarmouth) there is little or no evidence of the supposed economic benefits of EU membership. We have no fishing industry anymore but we do have many male seasonal agricultural workers & seasonal female service industry workers mainly from Eastern Europe who are routinely being exploited but are still better off than they would be in their native countries. I am a 62 year old English man, in 1973 when Edward Heath's Tory Government took the UK into the European Economic Community no-one outside of Parliament (Houses of Commons & Lords) had any say in the decision to join. In November 1974 when I gained my vote I was initially opposed to EEC membership but supported the Labour Party manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on continued EEC membership. As a 18 year old in June 1975 I voted to remain and was in the 67% majority as I was persuaded by Harold Wilson's promises that the terms of UK membership would be renegotiated and that the EEC was only an economic treaty and gave us access to a \u201cCommon Market\" for UK manufactured goods which would reduce unemployment and stimulate growth in the UK economy. I believed the Pro EEC Labour politicians that said the UK Government would always have a power of veto (as for example exercised by De Gaulle in 1967) to ensure that within the EEC no UK rights or powers would be abrogated against UK national interests. This is obviously not an exhaustive list but there was no discussion or proposals (in public at least) that there would be any EEC institutions which would be able to overturn legislation enacted by UK Parliament or any legal judgements delivered by our highest courts. In 1975 there was no freedom of movement & relaxation of border controls, no right to work & reside in other EEC states, no reciprocal rights of access to health services and welfare benefits to citizens of the other 8 EEC states. Not even the most ardent pro EEC politician openly advocated a European currency & Central Bank, common foreign & security policies nor even considered formation of a European Defence Force as we had NATO and the fall of the USSR & Iron Curtain was not expected. There was certainly no suggestion of further EEC enlargement leading to a European Union of 28 states nor consideration for future membership of another country whose land mass is over 90% in Asia \u2014 Turkey. However despite the betrayals of the Maastricht & Lisbon treaties et al and years of vehement denial by pro European politicians that the UK has been and always will be a nett contributor to the EU budget, a Pro European UK Prime Minister looking to paper over the split in his party over Europe promised a referendum. Despite the fact every promise given on protection of UK national interest has been broken the Remain campaign miscalculated the breadth & depth of opposition to their EU Federalist agenda particularly amongst older voters. I have voted in every UK election since 1974 and David Cameron gave me the first opportunity to express my disgust at the lies told by pro EU politicians since 1975. Despite the Brexit vote I have no faith that Theresa May will be able to deliver the hard Brexit that I would like nor do I believe that UK \u201cremainers\" will ever accept that they lost the vote and wil not seek to sabotage any \u201cdivorce bill\" put to Parliament. I actually believe that I & the working class of UK will be betrayed once again."
