This is actually unfortunate, as it is a source of much cultural misunderstanding between North Americans (yes, I\u2019m counting Canada and Mexico here, too) and Germans.The scenario: You walk into a store to browse the wares and - maybe - buy something. You don\u2019t know yet, you have to get your bearings first. In the USA, by the time you\u2019ve counted to ten, some young person with a name tag will have appeared in front of you, introducing him- or herself and offering to help you with any and all things at least three times in the space of seven seconds. In the USA, this is seen as helpful, positive and is a sign of good service. If this happens in Germany, that potential customer will never come back to your store.In Germany, the moment you make eye contact with anyone who looks like they might work there, said person will try to look very busy indeed or scurry off somewhere else where they cannot be seen. Alternatively, the store employee may seem to behave as if they are there to protect the wares from the customers. A US citizen shopping here will be shocked by what they perceive as dreadful service and probably leave in a huff. A German shopping here will be relieved that nobody wants to force a sugary-sweet, unwanted, superficial interaction. Then the German may actually need some help with something and feel somewhat inconvenienced - this will lead to suddenly feeling a little bit special when help is finally provided.The same applies to waiters in restaurants and caf\u00e9s (USA: they\u2019re so friendly and personal here! Great service! \u2026 Germany: My meal was fine 3 minutes ago, too - what does he/she think has changed in the last 3 minutes? Should I be worried?)The same applies to any number of social interactions, but I think you get the idea.Different takes on \u201cpoliteness\u201dHere\u2019s a fun game: combine two pieces of clothing (tie & shirt, blouse & jacket, whatever) that obviously don\u2019t match. Then\u2026Ask an American friend (ideally IN the US, as Americans living abroad may have assimilated somewhat) what they think of your outfit.If your American friend is \u201cpolite\u201d in the conventional, accepted manner for the US (and most English-speaking nations, to be fair), will not tell you the truth. It is important to remember that this is NOT malicious, duplicitous or mean - they\u2019re thinking \u201coh geez, they clearly put some effort into this outfit, and they look so happy, I just CAN\u2019T say what it really looks like, that would just hurt their feelings, and I really don\u2019t want to hurt them\u201d. So, instead, they tell you it \u201clooks great\u201d, and maybe that it\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d or \u201cquirky and cool\u201d, and generally skirt the issue, maybe try to change the subject.Ask a German friend what they think of your outfit. Your German friend will almost always say exactly what they are thinking, namely: \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right? That doesn\u2019t match - why don\u2019t you wear [insert alternative piece of clothing] with that instead?\u201d. Your German buddy feels he/she would be doing you a terrible disservice - and frankly, not be a very good friend to you - if he/she didn\u2019t give you honest, constructive feedback.To an American, the German\u2019s response would come across as blunt, insensitive and, well, rude. To a German, the American\u2019s response would come across as fake, sycophantic, and uncaring. In addition, the German who experiences this American behaviour too often may begin to think that Americans can\u2019t be trusted because you never know if they\u2019re telling the truth when asked an important question, or if they\u2019re being \u201cpolite\u201d.Different takes on \u201cpunctuality\u201dSay there is a dinner party\u2026 the invitation says it starts at 8:00 pm (US), 20:00 (DE). When do you arrive at the door, flowers and wine in hand?If this is the US, and you show up at precisely 8:00 pm, you are probably inconveniencing your hosts. They will certainly not be expecting anyone to actually arrive before 8:30 pm, and will probably be setting the table, maybe making final preparations. Why are they not expecting anyone at the time they said the party starts? Because nobody does this. It\u2019s not done. It\u2019s needy and intrusive and weird. It makes people uncomfortable.If this is Germany, and you show up at 20:30, your hosts might be a little miffed. They probably decided at some point (like\u2026 20:09) to start without you. They may have rearranged seating to compensate for your absence, they may have to re-heat something or bring you an appetizer, when everybody else is already on their entree. It\u2019s awkward, it\u2019s disruptive, and it\u2019s not fair to the other guests, either. It may also create the impression that you are not dependable/reliable.In both locations and scenarios, you have done something \u201crude\u201d.Hope you had fun with this answer. As I said at the beginning, I do exaggerate, but fundamentally, the statements are true - and knowing these things about each other can help make us all a just little bit more inter-culturally competent.",
            "In Germany:- When you dine with people, do not drink your wine/beer before toasting all together. - Do not use the word fascist/nazi randomly, actually do not mention at all.- Do not say \u2018happy birthday\u2019 to anyone before their birthday arrives, not even 1 minute before 12.- Do not speak loud but also do not speak like you are a weakling, germans tend to respect people who speaks louder than they do (go figure).- DO NOT lie.

This is very important. The whole system is based on trust. For example, you don\u2019t necessarily have to validate your ticket each time when you get on a public transportation because they assume you already have one. But once in a while, someone in civilian clothing will randomly ask you to show your ticket to them. If you don\u2019t have one, you will have to pay A LOT. There\u2019s toleration for mistakes but no toleration for lying, fraud, etc.- Do not expect to hear compliments about your work, unless it is very, very, very good.- If you have a problem, always say it.

People will tap on your window and tell you to turn the engine off. You are polluting the air they are breathing and wasting irreplaceable fossil fuels.Parking your car on a bike path - You are just asking to have your car vandalized. Biking and the safety of bikers is a big deal in Germany and you as a driver have no right to impede their path by having part of your car situated on a designated bike path.Using a crosswalk against the light - This is doubly true in the presence of kids. You are corrupting the youth and teaching them bad habits. It takes a community to raise kids properly.Chewing with your mouth open - Not great to do anywhere, but an especially big deal in Germany. Very rude. Don\u2019t do it. Animals chew with their mouth open. Don\u2019t be that person.Resting one hand under the table while eating - Both hands need to be on the table while eating.Not greeting people in a small space - This one is subtle. Picture a small 8 room hotel with breakfast included. You come down for your breakfast and all the other people are already sitting there. Say good morning. The situation dictates the need for this. You\u2019ll know when it feels right to do it. If nothing else give people a nod or an acknowledgment. Especially true in less rural areas and when older people are involved.Intentional littering - Don\u2019t ever do this.Excessive noise - Especially late or on the weekend. There are pretty strict time frames to do certain things. Don\u2019t mow your lawn before 10AM on a Saturday. Don\u2019t make excessive noise after 5PM either.Calling people - Calls in the evening are generally not appreciated. It\u2019s family time. Especially true with the older generation. Call during the day. Ideally not between 1 and 3PM though.Loud talking - Keep your conversations to yourself. Only drunk or rude people don\u2019t monitor their speaking volume.Taking a seat on a subway or bus - When there is a older person next to you standing. Offer up your seat. In a reversal to the US, kids are expected to get up for older people too. In the US I see people offer up their seats to kids.I think that\u2019s about it. Seems like a lot. I\u2019m German, but live in the States so I see both sides of it. Some of these have eroded a bit over time. If you go back 15 or 20 years these were all very relevant. The older generation definitely still lives by these principles.",
            "I\u2019ve been in Berlin for about two months now. Here\u2019s my longish list:I started learning German before coming here. People said I was wasting my time, that everybody here speaks English. That\u2019s not true. Many Germans don\u2019t speak English. Also, a number of people (usually officials or clerks) were upset that I don\u2019t speak their language yet, as if my not having learned the language yet in the span of two months is some grave offense.Maybe it\u2019s only this year but the summer isn\u2019t really summer.

Many Germans don\u2019t speak English. Also, a number of people (usually officials or clerks) were upset that I don\u2019t speak their language yet, as if my not having learned the language yet in the span of two months is some grave offense.Maybe it\u2019s only this year but the summer isn\u2019t really summer. There are hot and cold days. Sunny and overcast days. Clear and rainy days. A day can start sunny and end in rain. You can walk out in your shorts and have to wear pants and a light jacket by the end of the day. Also, the days are unbelievably long. The sun rises before 5 AM and sets at around 10 PM.WWII and the Holocaust. I am of Jewish descent. Many of my ancestors were taken to Auschwitz and other camps to be exterminated. I remember the first time I saw a stolperstein or \u201cstumbling stone\u201d in Berlin (these are brass plates inscribed with the names of Jews and information about the dates of their deportation and extermination, inlaid in the pavement outside their last place of residence) I froze. My heart sank, and a deep sadness welled from within me.Ethnic Diversity here is wonderful. There seem to be people from all over the world, all co-existing. Yes, there have been some glitches, but seeing this melting pot of diversity brings hope to the heart. Plus, you can have authentic food from almost anywhere\u2014from Mexican to Vietnamese to Turkish to Lebanese to Korean, etc., etc.Many, many people are tattooed, so much so that un-tattooed individuals seem rarer than tattooed ones. And so much so that I sometimes wonder if even the businessmen and women, under those fine tailored suits, are hiding some large and colorful dragon or tiger adorning their skins.I assumed Berlin would be cleaner. Before I came I had a vision of Germany as a glinting-clean place. And although it\u2019s not filthy, there\u2019s some waste strewn about in parks and on the streets\u2014empty beer bottles and food leftovers and dirty plastic packaging, etc.And speaking of beer bottles, people drink alcohol. A lot of it. I see many people walking around with some kind of drink in their hands, or people sitting outside bars or even in parks with an unbelievable amount of empty bottles by their side. Or in supermarkets, walking out with cartfuls of booze.Maybe I notice it more because I\u2019ve never lived in a place with so many churches, but there are so many of them here. Imposing ones with rising spires and crimson bricks and huge bells resonating blocks and blocks away. Having grown up in Israel, I find it hard to imagine how the visions of a carpenter in the Middle-East, over centuries and millennia, transmogrified into these massive, gothic places of worship in a completely different culture and milieu.The other day we went to a pleasant park and there were a bunch of kids playing in the nude, splashing each other with water and running around in the sand giggling. My son took off his clothes and joined them, and I thought, how wonderful that no one is embarrassed seeing naked kids playing around, that they are granted this easy, unconscious freedom that in many other parts of the would would have been considered inappropriate.Sex seems to be less of a big deal here. I\u2019ve seen a number of adverts in the street depicting some form of sex in illustrations. In the US, there would have been a lecherous quality to it, some kind of cleavage or exposed thighs, something to suggest and tease and taunt. But here there is something unassuming about its depiction\u2014a couple or even a threesome lying in bed covered in blankets, a cartoon of a man with his loins covered by a popping champagne bottle and a smiling woman by his side. Unassertive\u2014as if this, too, is a natural part of life and there\u2019s no need to make a fuss about it.Organic food is available in most supermarkets and is not necessarily exorbitantly priced. In fact, almost every little place that serves food will have some kind of organic lemonade or soft drink.Although I am not vegetarian, when I came here I imagined w\u00fcrste (sausages) everywhere, and a dearth of other, non-pork based offering. But, in fact, it is very easy to get vegetarian food here. From vegetarian gem\u00fcse kebap (Turkish food\u2014vegetables in bread) to vegetarian asian dishes, to tofu, grain- or legume-based meat substitutes in supermarkets, it is not only possible to be vegetarian here, but even easy.The streets and the curb are wide and spacious, oftentimes cobbled and shaded by evenly-distanced stately trees. Having grown up in Israel and lived in India, this was novel for me\u2014this European expansiveness.Some people can be incredibly proper and strict here. I\u2019ve been scolded for standing out in the street when the bus came, and then for standing in the wrong place inside the bus as I was paying. In some places and settings people are expected to behave in a certain ways, and are frowned upon if they are not.The bicycle is a serious mode of transportation with its own lanes and a substantial number of riders.Drivers are not as courteous as in other places\u2014in less trafficked streets with no stoplight, and unlike the US, cars will mostly not stop when they see a pedestrian, and one has to wait for an opportunity to cross.Things are well made. The walls of the apartment I\u2019m staying in are almost as thick as my outstretched arm. The woodwork is precise and sturdy. Some of the buildings around look like they\u2019ve been in existence for centuries, and that they will last for many centuries more. There is an assuring sturdiness in the material existence here\u2014like things are dependable and robust. Also, it is not difficult to find objects that are Made in Germany or Europe\u2014be it knives or rucksacks or wallets, etc.\u2014that look like they will last for a lifetime. I like that.Almost all shops are closed on Sundays.Parcels are left with neighbors. If you\u2019re not in and you have a package, it will be left with one of your neighbors, who will then, perhaps later in the day, come knocking on your door and claim the package with a slip.People have been incredibly helpful. When I arrived, a neighbor helped carry our luggage from the street. Another neighbor helps me whenever I need something in German translated. I\u2019ve had people in the street, after asking for directions, pull out their phones, search for the place, and give me clear instructions. Of course, as with everywhere else, there are also unfriendly people, but the friendly and helpful ones have left a greater impression on me.",

Here are some of my thoughts on the matter: 1. \u201cHow are you\u201d culture shock: When Germans ask you how you\u2019re doing they really mean it. They really want an answer. This isn\u2019t America where people ask \u201chow\u2019s it going?\u201d and don\u2019t give a damn. If Germans ask you a question it\u2019s to get an answer. Not to be nice to you. Or to make a new friend. But to get information. If they weren\u2019t interested in the answer they wouldn\u2019t have asked the question in the first place.2. Answering questions culture shock: When you answer a question in Germany provide as many details as possible. Don\u2019t just say \u201cI\u2019m feeling lousy today.\u201d Or \u201cI have a serious headache.\u201d Where are the details in that? If you have a headache mention the fact that the high humidity (enter humidity level here) has your blood pressure screaming. (And mention blood pressure numbers here.) And top it all off by stating\u2026 \u201cconsidering my numbers, I\u2019m surprised that I\u2019m even conscious!\u201d3. The telling it like it is culture shock: I once asked a German friend: \u201cDo you think I\u2019m fat?\u201d His answer: \u201cNot for an American.\u201d I of course was insulted. Hurt. Upset. But the thing is this\u2026.don\u2019t go fishing for compliments in Germany. If you\u2019re fat and you want someone in Germany to tell you that you aren\u2019t, forget it. That person doesn\u2019t exist.4. Small food portion culture shock: I was invited to a restaurant once as part of a welcome dinner to Germany and promptly ordered my dinner. When it arrived I told the waitress, \u201cExcuse me, there must be a mistake because I didn\u2019t order the kids menu.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the kids menu. It was the normal adult menu. And upon hearing this I said, \u201cthen I\u2019ll take 2 please.\u201d5. Service culture shock: In Germany waiters don\u2019t work for tips. This means that when you say to the waiter, \u201ccheck please\u201d when you\u2019re done with the meal, \u2026he\u2019ll often understand this as a perfect opportunity to go on his break or quit his job forever and emigrate to New Zealand.6. Condom Machine culture shock: Germans aren\u2019t prudish at all. And this is why they even have condom machines in the mens room at IKEA. I once asked a German friend, \u201ccan you believe it, condom machines at IKEA?\u201d He looked at me in a rather puzzled way and asked, \u201cwhy not? As long as they\u2019re not made out of wood.\u201d What an answer, right?7. Telling time culture shock: Germans have a complicated way of telling time. You\u2019ll ask someone what time it is and you\u2019ll hear, \u201cits 5 minutes past half eight.\u201d \u201cF\u00fcnf Minuten nach halb Acht.\u201d I almost had a seizure the first time I heard this had it not been for the guy who told me in English, \u201cits 7:35.\u201d8.

Not one step before the box, but when inside. It was my first day in Germany and the respect towards rules and regulations really left me awestruck. I was impressed that no one was trying to be a \u2018badass\u2019. Shock 2:I had an appointment with my University professor at 12 noon. But, when I reached there (on time, of course), he was having lunch. He saw me, left eating and started discussing the project I was interested in. I felt bad that I was interrupting his lunch and asked him to finish his lunch and that I could wait. I insisted multiple times. It shocked me when he said, \u201cWhen I say it\u2019s okay, it is okay.\u201d I learned that people in Germany value not only their own time but also the time of others. When I told about this to my German roommates, they told me that there is no need to insist multiple times. It is sufficient to ask for just once. This is quite different from India, where asking multiple times is considered polite. Example while eating, we often say, \u201cPlease take another roti.\u201dShock 3:In universities and offices, people usually turn up 5\u201310 minutes in advance. They are not on time but arrive ahead of time. There are exceptions, of course. For example, long distance Deutsche Bahn are often late (Source). However, they are trying to tackle this issue and Deutsche Bahn does provide compensation if you miss a connection. Their terms and conditions are modeled accordingly and are here (Your passenger rights in rail transport). Shock 4:The stand on nudity is quite liberal in Germany. I was surprised to see a naked guy in the locker room of my gym. But, he didn\u2019t even flinch. He just carried on as if there was nothing out of place. This happened during my first week in Germany and now, I am not even bothered by it.I just keep my eyes down when entering, because I am still not cool enough for the culture here. :p Shock 5:I like to cook my meals and like it spicy (read hot). When I eat out, I find the food here is not spicy enough for me. And every time, I ask them for some chilli/curry powder, I get the \u201clook\u201d. :D You\u2019ll understand the \u201clook\u201d if you see the \u201cFalafel Teller\u201d in the photo below. :D A Falafel Teller has lots of fries, some falafel and a good portion of salad. It is my favorite healthy junk food in Germany. :PShock 6:On my first day, I was in the shop getting a local SIM for myself. Unfortunately, I was standing too close to the person in front of me (for his comfort at least). The person in front of me was about 60 years or so. He looked back at me twice or thrice, expecting me to take the hint and move a bit back. I, naturally, didn\u2019t understand why he kept looking back. He, finally, said, \u201cCould you please move back a bit?\u201d And I obliged his request. Personal space in Germany is larger than in India. It is not appreciated when you invade their personal space. As a general rule of thumb, I, now, maintain about an arm\u2019s distance. NOTE: This is not racism, but just a difference in cultural values. Try not to take such incidents personally.Shock 7:To see beer being distributed (during fests) in the University. [Image attached below]Having a beer vending machine in my laundry room. [Image attached below]Beer seems to be all around and I am not complaining. Why would I even?! I\u2019m lovin\u2019 it. :D",

Of course, we are not angry, and we are not averse to visitors, but in other countries of the world, you are virtually courted as a tourist. In Germany, nobody is interested in that, even though we probably find you perfectly ok. 5. We do not speak English very well. With speaking English here, you are not as successful as in countries like Sweden. Although we know English better than France, especially the o...",

He was almost offended when I said its too early.In Germany, it's never too early. The second \u201cOnly in Germany\u201d moment came when the train reached Unterf\u00f6hring and all of us heard 5 sickening Gunshots. There was 1 gunshot and then there were 4. It took the whole train full of people a few seconds to realize that those were Gunshots! And at one moment, the WHOLE train drooped to the floor and tucked their heads in.In one unified moment, no one dropped to the floor sooner neither later. And then there was silence.Punctuated rarely by faint sobs, utter and complete Silence. The sheer German discipline jolted 200 people into evasive positions. A few minutes later, I along with many others peeped out of the window to see a man lying down in small pool of blood and the Polizei running to the floor above us.In a matter of 7 minutes, the next German thing happened where 10 Cops manned the train doors and everyone emptied the train in a matter of seconds.We climbed 1 floor above the station exit and saw almost 50 Polizei Cars and a Helicopter in the Air.  And then it happened!!All the cellphones of all the people beeped in unison. A text message from the Federal Government stating \u201cNot a terrorist attack. Stay Calm. The accused has been captured.\u201d(Was in German, I couldn\u2019t take a screenshot.) So up until now, the Germans have had 7 minutes in which 2 people die, Suspect is shot in the leg and captured, 50 Police cars have shown up, close to 200\u2013300 people have evacuated a train and the Government has informed everyone in the city! It was not over yet for the stranded tourists/business fliers though.The police started combing the area and the locals had started booking Uber for the ride to the airport. The tourists were slow to realize this and soon Uber Cabs turned to \u2018nicht verf\u00fcgbar\u2019(not available). Panic started building up and then the most strikingly German thing to me happened. People in the area came out of their houses with their cars and offered everyone free rides to the Airport. 100s of Cars came rushing in and started clearing the area off worried travellers. As you can see I took some pictures, I missed a whole wave of good Samaritans while doing so. I looked back on the road and I see 95% of the people gone. My wife by now, got a grip on the situation and realized that the flight is in 90 minutes and I have missed the chance to get dropped to the airport. Oh was she fuming like a raging bull. I asked a bystander, how far is the Airport from here and can we walk it down?He laughed first. Then said \u201cIt's 27 KMs from here, my friend. If you have your flight in 5 Hours and 37 minutes, Yes you can walk it up.\u201dI said \u201cNo, its in 87 minutes now. And my wife is fuming at me there.\u201dHe immediately said \u201cI am waiting for my colleague to pick me up. You can come with us, we will drop you to the airport!\u201d The colleague arrived and we jumped into the back of the car. She drove in the Most German way possible : DISCIPLINED and FAST. We made small talk and I offered money in return of the favour, when we are about to reach the airport, and they vehemently refused. He said \u201cNie. Niemals\u201d(Never. Never Ever.) They dropped us to the airport and we exchanged contact details. They were getting late for work, so couldn\u2019t get a picture. :-(In the next 10 minutes, I got the below mail from him :\u201cDear Adwit Hope You got your flight and you are safe back home.Don\u2019t mix this last impressions from Munich with the overall experience in Europe. It\u2019s a Beautiful and good Country. Cheers\u2026\u2026.\u201d What is patriotism you ask? This image is your answer. Finally, we got our boarding cards and called the AirBnB gentleman Mr. Klaus just to inform him that we are safe. And he said the most German thing my wife has ever heard \u201cI told you to leave early. Didn\u2019t I?\u201d Details on the train station shooting :Munich shooting: Officer critically injured with police gunA German policewoman was shot in the head in the attack and one person has been arrested.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40258353Edit : First 1000 upvotes!!

A popular souvenir from road trips to Malaysia is that single roll of bubble gum for personal consumption I nevertheless didn't dare to chew outside my home as a child. My mum told me the police would come and catch me fairly often when I was little.

Engineers tried to verify the issue and unable to find the reason for almost 1 week. After 1 week, they identified that it is because of chewing gum stick to the doors. This incident makes considerable revenue loss to government. As a precautionary measure; government passed a rule to ban selling chewing gum in singapore. However, you are allowed to buy from other country and eat in singapore. :)",

The ban on the sale and import of chewing gum was enacted in 1992, after the government decided that there were too many vandals disrupting the public transit system by sticking their used gum on the doors of the trains.

The ban on the sale and import of chewing gum was enacted in 1992, after the government decided that there were too many vandals disrupting the public transit system by sticking their used gum on the doors of the trains. The lack of criminal entrepreneurs in the country meant that no black market for chewing gum ever emerged, and gum virtually dissapeared from the streets overnight. Desperate gum addicts had to cross the border to Malaysia to smuggle gum home for their personal consumption. Chewing gum soon took on the same exalted status as weed in the US; all the cool kids chewed gum with their friends, but only the most reckless of degenerates would dare to chew gum in public. Rapists, murderers, and members of the opposition party were rumoured to hold bubble gum orgies in the dark underbellies of the city (which till today have yet to be discovered). Little known fact: During the negotiations for the US-Singapore free trade agreement in 2003, two sticky issues could not be resolved (pun intended): the war in iraq, and chewing gum. Concessions were made by both sides, and Singapore finally lifted the ban on chewing gum in 2004, provided that the gum was for \"therepeutic purposes\" (e.g. teeth whitening). Since then, sugar-free gum has become available for purchase in virtually all corner stores in Singapore, but still no one chews gum cos who gives a crap now that it's legal. The cool kids have moved on to sharing potato chips on the train, because that still carries a fine of $500. The reason why everyone thinks its illegal to chew gum in Singapore is because it's such a compelling narrative. This is the country that conducts mass genocide of drug traffickers, sentences American teenagers to caning (the horror!), and represses all types of civil liberties. Of course they would criminalize something as innocuous as gum. In the mid 1990's, a BBC reporter actually suggested that such a draconian law would stifle the creativity of Singaporeans. Lee Kuan Yew retorted: \"If you can't think because you can't chew, try a banana\"  Like the 8 year old who refuses to give up on Santa Claus, a quote like that makes you just want to keep believing in the myth of a chewing gum ban.  tldr; my country is awesome that's why Source: Chewing gum ban in Singapore",

This should have been easy given that these people likely speak your language, are educated and well informed so it should be easy to convince them to join any good  cause. Unfortunately, no idea is so great that will convince people to lose their comforts, give you all their possessions and risk their lives!. Now look at Gandhi. Gandhi's greatness lies in his ability to unite Indians of all faiths and all regions from east to west and north to south including those whose language or religion was very different than his.  He could provide a collective voice to poor, enslaved, uneducated masses of India coming from different backgrounds, even people that never had any concept of a nation or what freedom means. Millions of people left their jobs on Gandhi's call, gave away their wealth and possessions, left comforts of their homes, and were willing to suffer by going to Jail and suffer beatings of Lathis.  Why?  How he could do that for a country of size of India what you couldn't even do in you neighborhood? Because his life was transparent, honest, and he saw no evil in anyone and his actions were never for his own gain. People could believe him because here was a man who never demanded any thing for himself - no position of power, no special privileges for himself or his family.    He didn't care for any position or power for himself but always thought of others.  He was willing to stand to the strongest army in the world purely on the conviction of his own ideas (spent 2200+ days in jail but had no ill-feeling towards any British person!). He believed in \"Being the change that you want to see in the world\" and did what he expected others to do himself.  There lies the greatness of the man!",

Well, you know, I think that it might be Gandhi, who is a real hero of mine.And now on to some background: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2nd October, 1869 - that\u2019s just 12 years after the first war of Indian Independence[3].Gandhi grew up in a princely state in western India, in a very conservative, strict and vegetarian household, ruled by a slightly indifferent father (as Indians fathers generally were back then, some still are), and a doting mother (as all mothers generally are). As a child, he was super naughty and loved twisting the ears[4]of stray dogs.He married when he was 13-14 years[5]in age (as was the norm back then) - was rebellious, ate meat[6], stole money to buy cigarettes[7], visited a brothel[8], did things that teenagers normally do including trying his best to rebel against his father. (remember, the only source of this information is his own Autobiography - had he not written these details - we might have never known about it)He was ambitious, wanted to study abroad - his father objected[9], but died, clearing his path - went to study law in London[10]when he was 19 - came back when he was 22 - tried his professional luck in Kathiawad and Bombay (Mumbai now) courts - failed[11].He was rescued from his ignominy by a rich Gujarati Indian Muslim merchant, Dada Abdullah[12], living in Natal, South Africa, he was 24 - went there for a case, stayed there for 22 years - fought for the rights of the Indians there - ran a newspaper in 4 languages[13]- ran a bustling farm - made some name - and finally returned to India for good and on a hunch. The year was 1915[14], and he was 46. Putting yourself in his Chappals Now take a pause at this moment - soak this up - put yourself in his slippers/chappals. You are a 46 year old NRI - a lawyer by profession but jobless - have read a few books - edited a newspaper - been part of social protests - been to jails - have a little money - one wife and 4 kids. You are Mohandas Gandhi.Now you must have done something in the next 32 years of your life - which resulted in your statues in almost every major world capital[15].Your Autobiography published in almost every language known to man and your life taught in Universities around the world.You being named as an inspirational figure by almost every mass leader and revolutionary born after 1940.With your face on more postage stamps, banknotes, murals and coins in more nations, than the Queen of England, Jesus and Gautama Buddha. And now, almost 70 years after your death, almost 100 years after you landed in Apollo Bandar, in Bombay, with your wife and 4 kids, hoping to find a job, if someone asks you, if you were great - How will you respond? Perhaps, you will smile and state with a muted confidence - No, I am not! The question is - Will you believe him?Thank you for reading.

He wasn't a sage, and that's the beauty of it- his pragmatism, sharp mind. He didn't give speeches to the crowd, and mobilize them for war, totally the opposite he sat in the slums, spoke of peace. Made himself a lovable character. Now coming to the points: \"Be the change you wish to see in the world\"He said it, he followed it. With the stature that came with his name, he could've got personal helicopters if he wished. However he wanted to be seen  as the people's man- he compromised all the luxuries of his life to attain his cause. Moreover he wasn't doing it as a sacrifice to some deity (he was very logical), but it revolved around symbolism. Poor people could relate to him, a higher-caste Indian undoing barriers created within the society to mobilize them against the British. When possible (many a times we would consider not possible as well) he traveled great distances on foot and traveled across the nation only on worst train compartments with leakages despite being offered better compartments by the attendant: \"Why would you shift me and not other fellows? Are they any less human than me?\" Usually people would fight to get the privilege of being called to shift from such a compartment and in contemporary India go to great lengths of bribery to actually achieve it. He lived in villages, mobilizing people from every village he traveled not because he loved villages but because he wanted to create a huge enough army to cripple the British. His contemporaries and rivals (Jinnah) used planes and luxury to travel.His clothing, food, lifestyle everything was symbolic. Described as \"naked fakir\" by Churchill, he never foresake his Swadesh clothes even while visiting Britain. He never indulged in partying and all, though no one would have complained even if he did. International Media Attention: His policies made immense use of this. Colonialism was accepted worldwide then, so the International Media wouldn't make that a topic of discussion like BBC does today if some country rules over another. However he provoked the British to act against him, constantly defying them with his huge support base. Now what international media doesn't accept is- attacking peaceful demonstrators. What he was forcing British to do was exactly the same. He was sacrificing his body to Lathis, his lifetime to jails to alarm the Westerners. As we know, there were lots of sympathizers to the Indian Independence Movement in Britain itself. Political pressure at an international level would be a huge deterrent to Britain retaining control of India. Eventually it was one of the main reasons for their departure with the creation of UN. His commitment to non-violence in itself is admirable, but it's pragmatism is even more admirable. He realized it would be very difficult to defeat the British with weapons, since they were definitely technologically much more superior (no debates there, I hope). If it would mean Independence, it would mean losses of many lives, including his own. YES, this is one of the important points. He wasn't willing to die so easily. Completely pragmatic. He didn't want to make- his 'small bit contribution' to the cause by bombing an institution and hanged after spending rest of life in jail. He believed in living longer, and utilizing each day of it to ensure 'a big contribution' in making life difficult for British. He knew his hunger strikes won't mean the end of his life- no Government would want to lay the claim of letting Gandhi starve to death . Again, international media pressure. Of course it's argued about why he didn't let revolutionaries act the way they wished. International Media explains it again. By bombing it, you're legitimizing Britain's oppressive treatment of the Indians and justifying the phrase \"White Man's Burden\" as uncivilized brats who keep bombing Parliaments, and must be taught a lesson. But when you attack a peaceful crowd, there simply is no justification. No security: He moved around the country, interacted with the masses face-to-face (not via TVs) through his prayers. Remarkably he never sought the protection of the security around him. He insisted on not being protected and living like just everyone else. There were 5 assassination attempts at him, he knew it. But advocated against protection. So much for being at par with the common man. I teach you nothing: He repeatedly insisted he was not above anyone else, as he was used to being called Mahatma, the God while living by the people. He insisted what he taught weren't some \"Gandhian principles\" but something which everyone knows. He never gave speeches on celibacy on stage. He just wanted to follow it. It's sad people have nevertheless made Gandhian principles after his death, and spend years digging contradictions from what sounds idealistic trash on paper. He demonstrated idealism practically- that was his beauty. India will get independence only when it's fit: Many say British gave India independence prematurely and should waited another 6 months which would have spared many horrors of partition. Gandhi therefore wanted to have it only when India was fit to grow itself. There were huge caste differences, lack of political leadership at earlier stages. When he deemed fit- he declared Quit India Movement- which was to get rid of the British as soon as possible by any means.  Partition of Bengal: No, he wasn't responsible for the partition. I can't convince someone who believes otherwise for he has probably not read any book on Partition. However what makes him commendable was controlling the situation in Bengal alone after partition and ensuring minimum casualties while Punjab violence wasn't contained with so many policemen. He got Hussain Sahrawardy- a rival, Muslim League proponent- to sit and fast with him ensuring a mutual deal to protect Hindus and Muslims. Another symbolism.Symbolism- As mentioned in Navin Kabra's answer, the symbolisms he used such as salt and multiple mentions in my own answer make him a wily and amazing politician. Uniform government: One of the beauties of his fairness. \"Freedom comes to India, not to Congress\". The initial list of cabinet ministers comprised of 14 members- 7 Congressmen and 7 from other communities such as Sikhs, Dalits (Ambedkar) and Hindutva (SP Mukherjee) at the insistence of Gandhi. What a beauty. Today, which cabinet would extend it's hands to the opposition for occupying 50% seats in the Cabinet? Delhi- Punjab- Pakistan: After his success in Bengal, he headed for refugee camps to Punjab, but with a pause in Delhi. And the devastation on seeing the condition there made him stop there longer. Now in Bengal, he'd saved Hindus from being killed mainly with Sahwardy saving Muslims. It troubled Gandhi to know Hindus were being massacred in Pakistan, and he wanted to save them. But when he realized Muslims were being ill-treated in Delhi, he had a reputation to take care of before going to Pakistan. Why would Pakistanis listen to his calls of compassion for Hindus? Only if he has done something which makes Pakistanis respect him. Jinnah had vilified him enough to ensure that wasn't the case. But.. but.. seeing the bad condition of the Muslims he fasted for the Muslims. For Pakistan- to get its due share of money. What became a huge controversy- him being called Pakistan sympathizer for ages. It also ensured his death. What he was doing was giving Pakistan their right- the money they were promised. When politicians realized just as the British did, they would court worldwide criticism for 'Letting Gandhi die' by fasts, they pandered to his demands. However he didn't break his fasts until all the conditions were accepted and until he was sure it wasn't a temporary commitment to break his fast. He didn't break his fast despite seeing signed documents from Nehru. Only when he was convinced people were cooled down, did he break his fast. And what was to be his next mission never happened- for he was about to set on foot to Pakistan after this. He'd obtained permission from Jinnah for this (wow!). Pakistanis were impressed with him- many consider him great even today for his final act. He was going there to plea for the Hindus. But a Hindu killed him 2 days before his mission. All these reasons make Gandhi an unbelievable personality. No other leader inspires the feeling \"I should have seen him, and known him\" like Gandhi. Ironically he was the only leader accessible to the masses.",

At the low end of the pool are the obvious things, like truth, non-violence, and the stewardship of the Indian freedom struggle. (Around here is also knowledge of all of Gandhi's faults.) But as you go deeper, you start appreciating his subtler qualities that don't get much airtime. I will offer my own journey of Gandhi awareness as an example - starting with the obvious qualities and progressing towards the subtler ones. Truth, Non-Violence, and Freedom When I was a kid in school, I was told that Gandhi always spoke the truth, invented the non-violent protest movement, and drove the British out of India and got us freedom. I was too young to really appreciate the non-violence and the importance of freedom, but I was impressed by the honesty and truthfulness, even under the most difficult situations. Gandhi Hating As a teenager, I went through an anti-Gandhi phase. I started sympathizing with the viewpoint that Gandhi's non-violent methods actually slowed down India's freedom struggle, and we could have gotten free much faster by espousing more direct military action, as suggested by Subhash Chandra Bose and others. I also felt that there was merit in the view that British left India because there was nothing more left to plunder[1], and India was becoming a liability for them - in other words, India's freedom was more to do with British wanting out, and less to do with the Indian freedom struggle or Gandhi's greatness. Non-Violence vs. Armed Resistance Only later did I started appreciating the non-violence and peaceful non-cooperation movement. Over the years, I heard of more and more armed uprisings/resistance movements that either failed, or just continued to fester for years without really reaching any results. I also started appreciating how much courage it would have taken for Gandhi and others to calmly offer themselves up for beatings[2]. Most importantly, I got some understanding of how (very counter-intuitively for its time) this could actually be a far more powerful force than armed uprisings (which are usually on the fringes of society in most cases, and not really mainstream.) And what I found most impressive at the time is that Gandhi invented this technique of non-violence and peaceful non-cooperation as a method of fighting unjust governments and other powers that be; and how this has inspired others all over the world and been used in many ways in many countries. This has literally changed the world. Especially amazing when you realize that when Gandhi first started doing this, neither his enemies (the British) nor his friends initially believed that it would work, but he saw further than them all, and succeeded in spite of all the naysayers. Embracing the \"common\" man Over the last few decades, as I saw various secessionary movements (called as freedom struggles by the supporters, and terrorist movements by the Government) fizzle out and die over the years, I began to appreciate the monumental difficulty of the task that the Indian freedom fighters faced. And I also began to see how it would be close to impossible for just the intellectuals of the early 1900s to really make much of a headway in the freedom struggle without the support of the society at large. Gandhi's greatness here lies in almost single-handedly changing the nature and composition of India's freedom struggle by involving the masses into what was until then the domain of intellectuals. It can be argued that this was a crucial turning point, and holding on to India became untenable for the British primarily because the common man had entered the struggle. And the methods Gandhi chose to do this are also very instructive - how he first understood the common man's concerns (i.e. his travels across the country immediately upon moving to India from South Africa), how he took efforts to show them that he could feel their pain (by living like them, instead of living like the intellectual that he was), and other things. Politics - the art of the possible More recently, as I see nations being ravaged by civil wars, and despotic dictators, and ridiculous levels of mis-governance, I begin to realize the magnitude of Gandhi's contribution to India, the free country. I am now amazed at how he managed to bring and keep together an organization as large and diverse as the Indian National Congress; how he brilliantly used persuasion, influence, veiled threats, mild threats, and major threats (e.g. fast-unto-death) to keep all the factions more or less aligned. For me, the fact that Gandhi \"played politics\" (some would argue \"dirty\" politics), makes him much more impressive than the saintly figure that is painted in our history books. It is a reminder that he did not live in a idyllic world of the past where just being a principled, honest, good guy was enough for him to rise to the top of the freedom struggle hierarchy. He lived in a messy world with vested interests, enemies and vendettas, and misguided charismatic leaders going against his vision - and he out-maneuvered them all to ensure that when India got independence, it was one country, and for 60 years afterwards, it has remained one country. And democratic. (For the purposes of this essay, we will ignore Jinnah and Pakistan, because that is a whole another story.) I believe, that without Gandhi's practical, pragmatic, but still visionary stewardship of the Indian freedom struggle, India would have become like Africa after gaining independence. In 1922, Gandhi actually called off the non-cooperation movement after the Chauri Chaura incident because \"India was not ready to achieve independence\". Few people in the freedom struggle supported Gandhi, or even understood it, but Gandhi stood firm and effectively delayed independence by maybe 20 years as a result. I think all the people who live in a peaceful, democratic India owe their entire way of life to Gandhi for this. The Power of Symbols But for me ultimately, Gandhi's greatness isn't based on his achievements, but rather his methods, two of which stand out. One of the most important thing that Gandhi really understood and used well, and which people fail to appreciate, was an uncanny ability to find causes, issues, and symbols that would resonate with the masses. I will give just one example here, but Gandhi did this very effectively throughout. In 1930, when the Civil Disobedience Movement was launched, a search was on for an \"issue\" to use as a spearhead of this movement. Gandhi surprised everybody by picking \"Let's make salt and not pay tax on it\" as the issue (this is now famous as the Salt Satyagraha, that started with the Dandi March). It is understandable that the British did not take this seriously. More interesting is the fact that most of the other leaders of the freedom struggle also thought that this did not make sense[4]. Wikipedia covers this nicely: Initially, Gandhi's choice of the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru and Dibyalochan Sahoo were ambivalent; Sardar Patel suggested a land revenue boycott instead. The Statesman, a prominent newspaper, wrote about the choice: \"It is difficult not to laugh, and we imagine that will be the mood of most thinking Indians.\" The British establishment too was not disturbed by these plans of resistance against the salt tax. The Viceroy himself, Lord Irwin, did not take the threat of a salt protest seriously, writing to London, \"At present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.\" However, Gandhi had sound reasons for his decision. The salt tax was a deeply symbolic choice, since salt was used by nearly everyone in India, to replace the salt lost by sweating in India's tropical climate. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights. The Salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly. Explaining his choice, Gandhi said, \"Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life.\" In contrast to the other leaders, the prominent Congress statesman and future Governor-General of India, C. Rajagopalachari, understood Gandhi's viewpoint. In a public meeting at Tuticorin, he said:      Suppose, a people rise in revolt. They cannot attack the abstract constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes...Civil disobedience has to be directed against the salt tax or the land tax or some other particular point - not that that is our final end, but for the time being it is our aim, and we must shoot straight. Gandhi felt that this protest would dramatize Purna Swaraj in a way that was meaningful to the lowliest Indians. He also reasoned that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally. After the protest gathered steam, the leaders realized the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, \"it seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released.\" This is just one example of Gandhi's phenomenal grasp of the power of symbols. There are many other little and big things - for example, starting the Salt Satyagraha with the 23-day, 390km, Dandi march through was another masterpiece of tactics that got him hundreds of thousands of new volunteers, freedom fighters, and international media attention.[5] My way or the highway The biggest reason I admire Gandhi is because of the sheer, bloody-minded, fuck-the-world, I-am-right-and-the-rest-of-the-world-is-wrong conviction he brought to his ideas. He re-looked at everything from first principles, he analyzed deeply, he took his time to take decisions, but after that he stuck to his principles no matter what the \"popular\" opinion was, and more importantly, even if his friends disagreed. More of us should do that. Footnotes/Further Reading: A great example of the Gandhi-was-overrated sentiment can be found in the Antu Barva character sketch by P.L. Deshpande (http://pandimi.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/antubarwa.pdf - last paragraph of page 9). Translating that segment into English is beyond my capabilities - I'm hoping someone else can take a crack at it. Also see: Why do some people hate Mahatma Gandhi? and Is Mahatma Gandhi unduly credited for India's long freedom struggle and Indian Independence? Were there other Indian freedom fighters who contributed significantly to the freedom struggle, but are not sufficiently recognized?I first appreciated this point (and other aspects of Gandhi) when I watched Gandhi the movie. It's a bit sad that a commercial movie did a better job of explaining Gandhi to me than my history books.The Onion satirically nails this sentiment: \"India's Nationalist Leader Pummeled Senseless by Practitioners of British Violence Movement\": http://www.theonion.com/articles/february-2-2006,10592/Makarand Sahasrabuddhe tells a great story about an exchange between Motilal Nehru and Gandhi just before the Salt Satyagraha. Maybe he will post it in the comments below. (Update: See the first comment below.)Wikipedia's write-up of the Dandi March makes for great reading: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March#March_to_DandiRandom Gandhi quote for your reading pleasure: \"Those who say religion has nothing to do with politics do not know what religion is.\"",

The answers I've seen so far talks about \"strategy\" as an abstract thing, something for some other people to do. Some other day. Maybe. The key is to start with things you can do as an individual, and slowly go outward from there. Live your whole life to fulfill your greatest purpose, and offer loving kindness to those around you. Don't worry about collective action until you live like this, day to day.  So here are some things you can do: The most important thing to do right now is to get in touch with your emotions. It is impossible to help make the world a better place unless you, yes you, do this. People these days naively assume that by describing everything intellectually, you will be able to then solve any problems. I'm an engineer by trade: this is how I solve engineering problems. This is not how you solve people problems. You will break your heart and your self if you try. We've solved a lot of engineering problems in this world, and had not really made a dent in solving any of the people problems.People don't want to get in touch with their emotions because then they would have to feel fear, anger, and hate. Underneath all of that are a searching for happiness, and never finding it. Searching for approval, because they really want acceptance. Searching for romance, because they really want love. Then all of that gets rationalized away. This is how we were brought up (Ho-Sheng Hsiao's answer to What things should teenagers know before going into adulthood?).You cannot do anything unless you are courageous. Courage isn't the absence of fear, or even that you push through in spite of fear. Courage comes from the practice of loving kindness, and the first person to practice this on is yourself.There are several ways to deliberately cultivate this. Meditation practice such as Vispassana is one way, but it is not the only way. Chances are high that you know someone in your life, your extended family, or your extended friendship circle that has talked about this, and even practices some form of becoming in touch with yourself. Those are the people to learn from if you are serious about this. (See below about \"network\" action).In America, we've traded freedom for \"security\". Security is an illusion: that is the seeking for approval and safety that we never really confronted going into an adult. We don't want the fear, so we give it to leaders and authority figures. What do you think would happen if you yourself is able to handle the fear? You stop trying to shove it to authority (parental) figures that can magically fix things. You start leading yourself, you start connecting with other people in your local community. You start handling the problems. This is how Open Source works in the software community. This is how it can work in general. It might not help for everything, but it works for a lot of things. (Ho-Sheng Hsiao's answer to Why is peace such a dangerous concept?)Collective action is a thing of the past. The old industrialized model is giving way to the networked model. The industrialized model optimizes for economies of scale. Once you get past a certain number of people involved, you can no longer know each person involved. There is no trust (no emotions), so you rely on the system. And the system is buggy. If it were not buggy, then we would not be complaining about it so much.In contrast, \"networked\" action allows individuals to work within a network of trust. Robert Paterson's book, You Don't Need a Job (The Rise of the Network): Robert Paterson, Sue Rose: Amazon.com: Kindle Store describes this in detail. So to sum up the \"strategy\": Get in touch with yourself. Be authentic and impeccable by feelings, words, and actions. Cultivate loving-kindness in yourself and others. Cultivate your trust network, and make things better, a little bit each day in your corner of the world. Pick a small thing to do in your community, and be courageous enough to do it.",

The problem which we face while doing it is lack of funds , it takes a lot of hard work to collect funds because a lot of people just think that its none of use although we try our level best to maintain full transparency , we assure them that each and every rupee donated by them is going in the right place . I tell you seeing happiness in the eyes of small children , old people can bring smile and tears together , its a great feeling to make someone happy and be a part of it .

End of last month we distributed blankets to people who sleep on the roads and footpaths , we started early morning around 4 so that we can get people , next we moved on to slums and seeing us their was a glitter in their eyes ,they were so happy because they live in a pathetic condition , we saw their homes its a pathetic life , we distributed food to their children and also blankets to each home.Its a long list of things that we do but the answer is already too long so I will leave for some other day.

They are advising me (via comments and private messages) to exercise restraint and be responsible in view of my popularity on this forum. I plead my inability to accede to their request. I believe my statements expressing unstinted support are made with a full sense of responsibility and prompted by my concern for the welfare of this country. Those who remind me about my responsibility because of the large number of followers I have on Quora, may please direct their advice to Digvijay Singh who believes in accidental ramming of a truck loaded with explosives into a convoy, to Navjot Singh Siddhu who has given a clean chit to this friends in Pakistan and absolved them of all responsibility, and to the likes of the Congress politician B. K. Hariprasad who has declared the Pulwama attack and our air strike at Balakot as match fixing agreement between Modi and Imran and to some people who have said that CRPF jawans who died deserve nothing special, as, after all, they were only doing their duty for which they were paid.

And a country with youthful passions and aspirations can only connect to a leader who connects with the people. In a scene from an old Bollywood movie \u2018Triranga\u2019, Inspector Vaghle(Nana Patekar) meets with Brigadier Suryadev Singh(Rajkumar). There inspector Vaghle says \u2018Criminals are holding the law in their hands. To deal with them I can\u2019t act under the law every time. He says that his idea is \u2018Pehle Laat, Phir Baat, Phir Mulaqat(First kick, then talk, then meet) to deal with criminals. After the Pulwama attack, India just followed the same principles to deal with Pakistan\u2019s proxy war. India didn\u2019t do any kind of meetings, didn\u2019t go on talk tables but conducted the air strike on Pakistan just after 12 days of the Pulwama attack.After the airstrike, Imran Khan\u2019s speech in Pakistan\u2019s parliament was noticeable where he said that he insisted India to give intelligence but India sent a dossier after doing an airstrike on Pakistan. There are some people who might think that the attack was on terrorist camps but I mentioned the name of the biggest terrorist camp in the world (Pakistan). So First Airstrike (Laat), then Dossier (Baat) and finally some meetings on Kartarpur corridor(Mulaqat). This is the new India Under Narendra Modi against terrorism. Today continuous encounters of terrorists are happening in Kashmir. Our security forces are acting aggressively to bring peace in Kashmir. Those separatists who were misusing the freedom and facilities from India are now worried. Today the Modi government banned the terrorist organization JKLF in Kashmir. It\u2019s a big achievement for India. After the Pulwama attack, the country wanted these actions from the Modi government and he did that. Therefore today Modi has emerged as one of the most popular leaders across the world. But these things are not new. Narendra Modi has always been a strong and determined leader. His views about terrorism were the same in 1992 and 2019. In an Interview, Bala Saheb Thackrey once said that politicians are the slaves of votes. They can change their ideas and ideology anytime. However, Narendra Modi has never changed his attitudes. Every time Modi says something, he tries to keep his words. He said to build the tallest statue of Sardar Patel, he did that. He said to teach Pakistan a lesson when he was the C.M of Gujarat. After becoming the P.M of India he did that. When a leader keeps his words and acts according to the sentiments of people, he is loved by the people. There was a time when politicians used to cross all the lines for an imported term \u2018secularism. For this thing, politicians even sidelined national interests many times. Israel, that always helped India during wars was ignored by the previous governments. The minority appeasement politics was at the peak. But the rise of Narendra Modi has shifted the Indian politics to a new height. In 2014, when Modi was asked about why he does not wear skull caps in Aap Ki Adalat, he replied \u2018I have never seen Gandhi Ji wearing any skull cap neither I have seen Sardar Patel so doing.\u2019 He is not like those politicians who visit temples during elections. Today we can see how politicians are desperate to become Hindus and how they are visiting temples.Basically, Modi is what he is. He has a very humble background and too many struggles in his life. An ordinary man can find himself in Modi\u2019s life. Therefore it connects Modi with people and makes him a People\u2019s leader.He is a master in making things large. Whatever he does he tries to make it interesting and inspiring. Recently when he washed the feet of some garbage cleaners, he gave a beautiful social message of peace, unity, and harmony. When he celebrates his Diwali with soldiers that inspires India to aspire to become a new India. The way he works passionately at the age of 68, he just outshines everyone. He is a detached man from his family, therefore, works honestly. His visionary ideas, honesty, patriotism, hard work, and inspirational speeches are the secrets of his popularity."

But there has also been a steady progression in a greater consciousness of the need for lovingkindness and justice. Some people yield to despair and say, \u201cWhat does my one voice, my one action, matter?\u201d My answer: it matters to the entire world. It is not for us to know exactly how we might impact others. I have often been told that something I said made a profound difference to another \u2014 in a conversation I scarcely remember. Even more: something I did or said may have had a ripple effect. Some positive change may well have occurred due in part to my conduct, and no one is consciously aware of my role. It is sufficient in and of itself to be of good will and conduct. That contributes to reaching the tipping point where paradigms shift, a different awareness is reached, the norms of liberty expand. I strive for good because anything less than striving to change the world for the better is unacceptable. Moreover: much of what we label as \u201cbad\u201d is capable of positive change. But that change won\u2019t come from being demoralized. Here\u2019s an apt quote from Marianne Williamson:Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.So shine. Be powerful. Change the world. Why settle for anything less?",

Selflessness is rewarded with an early death and the ending of your genes. Back in cave men times, only the selfish survived. Those who were selfless didn\u2019t survive long enough to reproduce. That\u2019s why ancient times are always filled with violent kings and dictators. Ruthlessness and selfishness is what nature favors. If you were kind and compassionate, the selfish would come and take advantage of you and they\u2019d subjugate you knowing that you don\u2019t have the desire to hurt. They take your kindness and turn it against you. Kings and dictators knew this so they ruled with iron fists and those who didn\u2019t were toppled by their power hungry siblings or cousins, perpetuating the cycle of selfishness. Even in the wild, animals who are ruthless and selfish will survive and those who are selfless will die early. Only the selfish and ruthless animals can hope to survive in an environment as harsh as the wild. Although as time goes on, humans have developed technology and evolved their morals. These days, good people have the same chance of living as bad people. But selfish people definitely find it easier to get into better social positions such as CEOs and politicians or other cut throat industries because they can burn more people along the way and not feel bad. The world we live in is an inherently predatory place. Survival is winning and that\u2019s why the greedy and selfish find it easier to get to the top.",

Instead of asking how you can survive culinary school, ask how you will complete culinary school. Here\u2019s the answer: the same way countless chefs have completed their schooling, you just do it. When I began my culinary training, I maintained a mindset that said, \u201cNo matter how hard this gets, or how bad the 2-hour commute sucks, or how much I get yelled at by these aggressive French chefs, \"I will finish culinary school.\u201d  There was no doubt in my mind.  Once you remove that sense of doubt and tell yourself you will succeed, your mind is free to focus on more beneficial areas. Allow me to tell you two brief stories that emphasize the point I am attempting to get across:  Prior to April 8th, 1954, it was universally believed that no human was physically capable of running a mile in less than 4 minutes. Similar to the first perfect 10 in gymnastics -- before the 1976 Olympics, it was so widely accepted that no gymnast would ever score a perfect 10 that the scoreboard was not even programmed to display a \"10.0\". When Nadia Comaneci achieved the first perfect 10, the board read \"1.0\":In both these cases, the universal belief was that these achievements were simply not possible because they had never before been done. But then Roger Bannister broke the 4 minute mile, and Nadia scored a perfect 10 (with many more to follow). Since these events, many people have completed the 4 minute mile, and many gymnasts scored perfect 10s before the system was changed.  What changed? After these feats were accomplished, they were no longer seen as impossible.  The mindset of the masses shifted drastically.  One could argue that humans are continuously evolving, becoming bigger, faster, stronger and smarter.  But not at this rate.   \"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.\" --Marianne Williamson  Culinary school is definitely intimidating at first. But think about it \u2013 what\u2019s the worst that could happen? You\u2019re human, just like all of the other students who have conquered culinary school.  You will probably be pushed to limits you never thought you were capable of reaching. Think about how the Marine Corp operates, for example. I would never disrespect the Marines by comparing their boot camp to culinary school \u2013 I simply wish to point out how we as humans survive rigorous training when we have serious doubts that we can endure.  It all comes down to mind over matter.  Don't aim to survive \u2013 aim to succeed. Aim to be the best in your class. Why is that so far-fetched?",

I agree that your mindset is crucial, and I think he's spot on in how to approach the challenge.  You have a story in your head about what kind of student you are, right now. You love school, you hate school. You\u2019re a good student, you suck at school.

That\u2019s good information, but that\u2019s all it is \u2013 information, a starting point. Because whatever kind of student you\u2019ve been in school so far, cooking school can be quite different.  The rules are different in culinary school. You\u2019re on your feet, working your ass off, learning physical skills in potentially-dangerous kitchens. The relationships you\u2019ll be thrown into are also different in culinary school, and you\u2019ll need to interact with your instructors and your peers in ways that might feel intense to folks who are used to sitting around in desks a lot at school.   If it's a good school, you'll be pushed and challenged a lot, but this is the great kind of challenge, the fun kind. You get to start with a blank slate and prove you can work your ass off -- and as long as your instructors see you working your ass off, they'll help you. You'll rise.   Try to keep a wider view. This is job training. So instead of worrying about how you'll survive school, think about what you'll need to get out of school to succeed as a cook. Make your own plan -- what skills are you most interested in learning? Where do you need a little extra help to keep up (ask early!), and where do you want to push further than your school offers? People have been learning to cook without culinary school for centuries by apprenticing in restaurants. The chefs who work in culinary schools are not only willing to take you on as an apprentice, they\u2019re paid to do so. They\u2019re working full time to teach you the skills you\u2019ll need in the field. They will take the time to structure a solid learning experience for you, and if you work hard, many of them will work their personal connections in the industry to help you land a job during or after your time in school.  So work hard, ask questions, jump in with some enthusiasm, get your ask kicked, come back and do it again, work even harder, have some fun, end up with a job you love, eventually... ",

Despite popular belief, one\u2019s primary residence is an expense. A necessary expense, but an expense just the same. A bigger house will nearly always cost you money in the long run. While it\u2019s possible to potentially make money on capital gains in a fast rising, hot real estate market, this is very risky and most folks won\u2019t get ahead. Every addition will add less to the market value to the house than what it costs to add, and every addition will increase maintenance expenses. A car is also a necessary expense, even more so than your house if you really come right down to it, at least in America. That said.. someone might not need that much house, but is crazy about cars. Another person might have to spend a LOT of time in his car, perhaps more so than the average person. If you spend 20+ hours a week in your car, or even more, the extra cost for the comfort is likely to be worth it. Imagine you are an independent realtor, and you occasionally have to give rides to your customers. Even if you don\u2019t, your customers will see your car. You will have to present yourself as successful, whether you are or not. If you show up in a crappy car, the potential customer might conclude you\u2019re a terrible salesman that can be taken advantage of. If you are in fact a terrible salesman, you probably will be. Of course, if you\u2019re trying to get a sales job, then again it can help if you show up in an expensive, fancier car, because that signals to the employer that you are very good at what you do. Though I suppose if you\u2019re really a superstar salesman, you might be able to talk your way into that anyway. But let\u2019s face it.. it\u2019ll be easier. While unfortunate, some folks will judge you by the kind of car you have, and after your clothes and physical appearance, your car is probably the next thing others might see. I could see how it might potentially cost you certain opportunities. Though for most folks, this is unlikely to be a concern and the extra expense is likely not worth it.",

She literally couldn't refuse to take them since the law gave the doctors the power to make her take the drugs by (virtually) any means necessary. The drugs were terrible and she felt lifeless; they treated the manic episode, but they had bad side effects that virtually negated the benefit of treating the mania. Even now, the doctors still prescribe her drugs that are unnecessary and have bad side effects (one of the drugs aren't for \"women of child-bearing age\" yet they still prescribe them to her). When she asked the doctors to explain how the drug works, they literally could not explain it to her, yet they still insisted that they knew what was best even when my friend tried to present them with evidence from a research study that showed that the drugs were largely ineffective in treating mental disorder. These doctors might know just enough psychology to convince themselves that they have a rudimentary understanding of what's going on in someone's brain, but they really don't know a whole lot, if anything, about the brain and the mind. Unfortunately for my friend and others in her position, they also know enough to given the title of \"doctor\" and given authority over people's lives.

That he was universally beloved. Although Washington probably was the least criticized president we've ever had, he didn't completely escape criticism. In particular, Washington's reaction to the Whiskey Rebellion and his acceptance of the controversial Jay's Treaty tarnished his image in the eyes of many. That being said, he was referred to (even in his own day) as the \"Father of his country\", so there's at least some truth to this assertion.  That he wasn't ambitious. I think Washington sometimes gets portrayed as this humble guy who never craved power or fame, and just fell into his leadership roles by happenstance. While Washington's resignation of his post of general of the Continental Army in 1783 and his stepping down after two terms as president were admirable acts undoubtedly, he was also a man who was extremely conscious of his place in history and wanted to be held in high esteem by both his contemporaries and by posterity. Alexander Hamilton actually played on this vanity in order to help convince Washington to become the new nation's first head of state. Essentially, Washington wanted to be seen as America's Cincinnatus. That he always enjoyed good relations with other founders. I think some people in general have a naive view of the early years of this country, where wise white men in wigs sat around agreeing with each other. The truth is much more complicated. Basically, as Washington's time in office went on, Thomas Jefferson became increasingly convinced that Washington was actually in the thrall of Alexander Hamilton and his toadies, since Hamilton was a trusted adviser to Washington. He started circulating rumors in the opposition press that Washington was actually senile, and thus was just going through the motions of being president, while Hamilton was the one really in charge. Washington found out about this, and was extremely hurt by what Jefferson was doing. He wrote Jefferson, essentially saying that he knew what he was up to and that their friendship was over; they would never speak again.",

The entire southern front was a disaster.  Washington was personally brave but very very reluctant to a fault to pull the trigger even when he had sufficient plans and numbers.  The plans that ultimately were successfully  executed and which won the war were devised not by Washington but by the French.  In 1796 Thomas Paine published a \u201cLetter to George Washington,\u201d in which he claimed that most of General Washington\u2019s supposed achievements were \u201cfraudulent.\u201d \u201cYou slept away your time in the field\u201d after 1778, Paine charged, arguing that Gens.

Most people today think of the American Revolution as a war between two, distinct groups--Americans and British--with Americans ending up winning the war. In fact, the conflict was more properly viewed at the time exactly the way the British viewed it--as an insurrection by a minority of rabble-rousers in the American colonies against their British government. The Brits as late as 1770 correctly assumed that most Americans supported the Crown, and would never agree to a full separation from the mother country. In fact, up until 1775, even many of the people who would eventually sign the Declaration of Independence did not expect a complete break with England. They simply believed that a forcible enough resistance would bring the Crown to the negotiating table to restore the self-government that Americans had come to expect through over a century of benign neglect. By mid-1776, the Continental Congress was radicalized enough to pass the DoI, when the odds of success were still long. But they were yet ahead of the majority of their fellow Americans. What the British greatly underestimated was the violence of the American response to what looked to them like a full-on military invasion. The British response to the trouble in the colonies was so harsh, so arrogant, and so overbearing, that they quickly created a generation of Americans who really hated the British military, and blamed the out-of-touch Crown that had sent them, the way a teenager would view a parent that suddenly became transparently abusive. Not everyone in the British leadership was that out-of-touch. Many in Parliament understood how counter-productive a massive show of force would be. Even General Howe, sent to lead the army to quell the rebellion, had grave concerns about that strategy. But these men were overruled by their hawkish colleagues who, like everyone else at that time, could not conceive of Americans doing anything but ultimately submitting. As the Americans were trying to recruit the French to aid their cause, many of them did not contemplate actual defeat of the British military and complete independence from the Crown. But once the vicious cycle of harsh responses leading to more rebellion leading to harsher responses began, the American resolve for total independence began to harden. The rebels lucked out by gaining French help, without which a stalemate, let alone victory, was impossible. French help had nothing to do with supporting Americans' nominal grievances (e.g., restoring their rights as Englishmen), and definitely not about abrogating allegiance to a sovereign King with a divine right to rule. The French royals were in it simply to drain British resources in order to enhance their strategic position against England. Even with that support, and their defeat of the British at Yorktown--the second loss of a British army in four years of conflict--British forces still outnumbered American militia in the colonies, the Americans had no hope of dislodging the British from New York, and they knew that the French militarily support came with an expiration date. By 1781, Independence was neither assured nor, for most people, assumed. But after the British defeat at Yorktown, the Americans negotiating in Europe--Franklin, Jay, and Adams--read the situation brilliantly. They saw Parliament's hawks swept out of power, and aggressively sold the new British leadership on the value of abandoning a draining American occupation under increasingly hostile conditions in order to attend to the rest of their Empire now under siege. They sold these advantages, and the implicit promise of normalized commerce with them (as their largest trading partner), as they pressed their demand for independence. And 18 months of dogged diplomacy later, they won it. The way the revolution is taught, and the subsequent rise of America, has always given the Revolution and Independence a certain air of inevitability. It was, in fact, a highly improbable and unexpected outcome of a very peculiar moment in history."

There have been three sneaky methods for getting around this exceedingly inconvenient fact:Take credit for reductions in violent crime due to pre-existing trends, orSubtly re-frame the argument, usually by changing the metric to mass shootings, suicide by firearm, or the delightfully weasel-worded \u201cgun violence,\u201d orJust lie outright.Australia\u2019s homicide rate is a perfect example of Method #1:(Courtesy of Quora\u2019s own Guy Smith: Gun Facts, Gun Control Policy Information) Granted, this is the homicide rate specifically; if you want the stats on other subcategories of violent crime, you can find stats on that at Australia Crime > Violent crime Facts & Stats. (Different countries define violent crime in different ways, which makes country-to-country comparisons difficult.) But the overall pattern holds: if you compare the trendline (i.e. the average rate of increase or decrease that evens out the year-to-year variations) for Australia\u2019s homicide rate before and after they passed their gun ban, they\u2019re identical - all the way down to four decimal places! So here\u2019s a great example of how it\u2019s possible to tell the truth and lie at the same time. Yes, it\u2019s true that the homicide rate went down after Australia passed their gun ban. That is absolutely a fact. What is not true is the implication that the gun control laws passed had anything to do with it!\u201cA half truth is a whole lie\u201d - Old Yiddish proverbIf it were true that gun control actually reduced overall violent crime then it\u2019d be possible to find a graph that looked something like this:\u2026where nothing else that may have actually affected the crime rate (like hiring more police) took place at the same time as that gun control law being passed. So far I have never seen a graph that looked like that, and at this point I seriously doubt it exists. So the ball is in your court, gun control advocates: show us a graph like that, and you\u2019ll have made a viable argument for gun control. If you cannot, then the central claim of gun control (namely, that it decreases your likelihood of being involved in some sort of violent crime) has been completely refuted:This becomes obvious when you zoom way out from the fine details and look at the big picture. The USA has approximately half the guns on the planet:So if there was any correlation between firearm ownership and the homicide rate we would be\u2026 well, certainly not right in the middle of the graph!   So much for Method #1 (steal the credit). Method #2 (redefine the argument) is even more disingenuous, and comes in several different flavors. Let\u2019s tackle the most pernicious obfuscation first, that of redefining the problem as \u201cGUN VIOLENCE:\u201d\"Gun Control: The theory that a woman found dead in an alley, raped and strangled with her panty hose, is somehow morally superior to a woman explaining to police how her attacker got that fatal bullet wound.\" - Women Against Gun ControlRedefining the argument to gun violence dismisses with a wave of the hand all the people who die from knives, hammers, baseball bats, hands and feet, cars, and every other tool of violence. Clearly it\u2019s not the tool that\u2019s important, it\u2019s the fact that one person is willing to intentionally harm another; that is the problem, and nothing else! The only metric that counts is the likelihood that you (or one of your loved ones) will have a Very Bad Thing happen. Whether or not that Very Bad Thing happens at the barrel of a gun, the point of a knife, the rapist\u2019s penis, or the fender of a car does not matter! Furthermore, \u201cgun violence\u201d either ignores or actually counts as a negative those Defensive Gun Uses that prevent violence. Estimates vary, but it turns out that these DGUs occur almost six times more often than all violent crimes involving a gun: (Wait\u2026 so we\u2019re only counting the self-defense uses in which the bad guy died as \u201csuccessful self-defense?\u201dAnd it\u2019s my side that gets painted as being bloodthirsty?!) Defining the problem as \u201cgun violence\u201d treats these lethal DGUs as part of the problem, while simply dismissing the murderer armed with a knife by definitional fiat! Or as William Loving succinctly put it: \u201cComparing only the frequency of shooting assaults in the United States in comparison to other nations is like comparing the number of kangaroo attacks in Australia to other nations and thus deciding it's because the Australians are somehow doing something wrong that the rest of the world is doing right.\u201d The gun control crowd loves pulling a bait and switch on \u201cgun violence\u201d numbers by including suicide:\u2026and to understand the scope of that particular problem we need to talk numbers for a minute: The United States of America currently has a population of just under 333 million. On average about 33,900 people have died annually from gunshot wounds since 1981. That means that about 0.01% of the population of the USA dies every year due to gunshot wounds, or expressed another way, 1% of 1%. Approximately 53% (18,861) of that 33,900 is suicide. More on that in a moment. So if we focus exclusively on homicides, then we\u2019re down to 13,394. Approximately 80% of that figure is due to drug gang violence in inner cities. Amazingly, approximately half of all homicides in the U.S. occur in the same two dozen neighborhoods! It\u2019s been estimated that we could cut the US homicide rate in half by permanently locking up as few as 3000 violent repeat offenders! This is not a gun problem, this is a complex socioeconomic problem. Setting aside that thorny issue, we\u2019re down to 4361 or so, which is only about 12.9% of annual gun deaths. This figure includes all accidental gun deaths, all justifiable homicides (both police and armed citizen), all non-drug-gang-related murder, and all firearms deaths in which the cause was unknown! That\u2019s a lot of numbers to process, so to get some perspective let\u2019s look at it visually:(Fairfax Underground)\u2026yeah, that\u2019s probably not the result you expected, huh?SUICIDE: So let\u2019s turn back to suicide for a moment: Australia\u2019s ban of firearms has shown us that banning guns doesn\u2019t budge the needle one bit on suicide rates. Oh sure, the firearm suicide rate (continued to) plummet, but the increase in the non-firearm suicide rate more than offset that drop:Approximately 50% of suicides in the USA are accomplished with a gun, 7/8ths of that being men. The USA has about half the guns on the planet. If there was any statistically significant link between firearm ownership and suicide, we would be the per capita world leader in suicide by a large margin. And we\u2019re not. According to WHO, we were 34th out of 183 countries in 2016: Suicide rate estimates. So no, more guns do not lead to more suicide.MASS SHOOTINGS: Now that the above information is starting to trickle out into more mainstream consciousness, the goalposts have been shifted yet again to \u201cpreventing mass shootings.\u201d This is a large and complicated topic for another time, but again it helps to zoom out to get some perspective on the scope of the problem:(Home - Prepared Gun Owners)(No, the US does not lead the world in Mass Public Shootings. That claim came from a paper published by Adam Lankford, who until recently did not share his data/methodology. It turns out that his study was literally based on methodological errors!)As much as they might like to think so, gun control proponents do not have a monopoly on care. (See Moral Foundations to explore the differences in moral evaluation between leftists, conservatives, and libertarians.) Joshua Alexander's answer to What is the central issue in the gun control debate? (Spoiler Alert: It\u2019s Trust and Understanding.) Not only does no law-abiding gun owner want innocent people to die, no law-abiding gun owner is callous enough to simply disregard the loss of life that occurs during a mass shooting. Every death is a tragedy, and when we evaluate using limited resources to decide national policy we must strive to reduce the total number of tragedies, not just the sensational ones that make the front page headlines! So why are we focusing on gun-related events that (again, to simply make the math easier) kill very approximately 33 people per year, or 0.00001% of the population, rather than directing that energy towards addressing the socioeconomic issues that plague inner cities, which kill 8,800 per year (0.00267%), or addressing root causes of suicide, which kill 22,000 (0.0067%)? And keep in mind, all of these figures totally disregard deaths that do not involve firearms; if we look at the overall causes of death, firearms as a whole barely rate a blip on the scale: FastStats (CDC leading causes of death in the US).And finally, we come to the 3rd method to get around the inconvenient truth, which is just to flat out LIE:There have been many times gun control proponents have been called out on deliberately spreading falsehoods, more commonly known as lying. Just a few years ago, NPR called out the US Department of Education\u2019s official count on 2015\u20132016 school shootings: The School Shootings That Weren't. Out of the 240 school shootings listed, 161 were just made up; they flat-out never happened. Most of the rest were substantially misrepresented.There\u2019s also gems like this article in Bloomberg: \u2018More Guns, Less Crime\u2019 Is Wishful Thinking. Looks good, up until you get to this line: \u201cNo matter which model was used, the study found that in states that adopted RTC, \u2018violent crime is substantially higher after 10 years than would have been the case had the RTC law not been adopted.\u2019\u201d Wait, would have been the case? I thought we were comparing hard data, but nope, John J. Donohue is just pulling predictions out of thin air to suit his argument!Now compare that to the methodology of his main opponent, John Lott Jr., author of More Guns, Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws. He compares actual crime rate data between different counties, or between different years, rather than against \u201csynthetic controls.\u201d One of these things is not like the other! Similarly, David Hemenway of the Harvard School of Health has been pulling these same bait-and-switch tactics for decades in an effort to bang the drum for gun control. The jargon-packed studies look extremely scholarly, but do not actually hold up to critical thinking. One example:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11525816_Firearm_availability_and_unintentional_firearm_deaths_suicide_and_homicide_among_5-14_year_oldsHemenway draws a relationship between firearm ownership and suicide. The problem? Direct data on firearm ownership is impossible to obtain, so researchers are forced to rely on proxies. Hemenway\u2019s proxy of choice? Cook\u2019s Index\u2026 which measures firearm ownership based on the rate of firearm suicides. So he\u2019s drawing a conclusion about the dangers of firearm ownership by noting that there are more suicides by firearm\u2026 in places where there are more suicides by firearm!Have you ever heard the claim that \u201ca gun in the home is more likely to be used against the homeowner than an intruder?\u201d Then you\u2019ve been the victim of a series of studies promulgated by Arthur Kellermann:https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199310073291506The problem is, A) These studies are a textbook example of fatally flawed methodology, and B) despite the misleading title, even the study itself only claims gun ownership as being the 5th most significant out of 6 listed risk factors. This study was so egregious, in fact, that it was the main driver for the Dickey Amendment banning the CDC from using any of its funding to promote gun control propaganda. Oh, they still did research (That Time The CDC Asked About Defensive Gun Uses), they just weren\u2019t allowed to lie anymore.BJ Campbell does a fantastic job of calling out Vox (among others) on the dishonest tactics they use whenever there\u2019s a mass shooting in this article: Everybody\u2019s Lying About the Link Between Gun Ownership and Homicide.^^^ Seriously, if you\u2019re only going to click one link in this answer, please make it this one. ^^^Look, I could go on and on, but the more people or publications I call out for being liars, the more likely it is that I\u2019ll get hit with a BNBR violation. But honestly, what other term should we use for someone who tells deliberate fabrications? \"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\" - Mark Twain/Benjamin Disraeli/Arthur James Balfour (depending on who you believe)So what\u2019s the truth?The truth is that the best available evidence says that legalization of private firearm ownership either has no meaningful effect on the violent crime rate, or there is some degree of positive correlation:Alfred Montestruc's answer to Is there any evidence that increasing gun access reduces homicide rates like the NRA claims?Alfred Montestruc's answer to Would libertarians agree that the formation of the state is responsible for the decline of violence over history?Dave Kopel\u2019s A World Without Guns essay points out that imagining a world without guns means imagining a world in which men dominate women, the strong dominate the weak, and the majority kills or enslaves the minority\u2026 or in other words, the Dark Ages.The benefits of firearms ownership in deterring a rogue government are substantial: the fear, the \u201copen secret,\u201d of Secret Police \u201cdisappearing\u201d politically inconvenient people that exists in authoritarian countries does not exist here in the USA; that job would be insanely dangerous in a country with so many firearms and people ready and willing to use them.Genocides usually happen soon after firearms are stripped from the population about to be exterminated. Governments in the 20th Century were responsible for more civilian deaths (Democide) than either deaths in warfare or from \u201cregular\u201d criminals:All of which means that we ought to allow unrestricted access to firearms to all adults who have not indicated a strong tendency towards violent crimes or severe mental illness. Maybe it can save us from the lime pits or being black-bagged. And even if not, if there\u2019s no rational reason to restrict them, then why do so? The best pro-gun argument is that it wins by default, because the other side\u2019s claims don\u2019t hold up to even casual scrutiny:",

            "Planned economies can face challenges for several reasons. One common issue is the difficulty of efficiently allocating resources and setting accurate production targets without the feedback mechanisms of a market economy. Centralized decision-making can lead to inefficiency, lack of innovation, and misallocation of resources. Additionally, political factors and lack of incentives for individual initiative can contribute to the failure of planned economies. Finally, external factors such as global market changes and geopolitical events can also impact the success of planned economies.",

The whole Soviet Union and the associated disasters were a con, in it\u2019s very foundations, economywise. Karl Marx intended to write a treatise on economy, in the middle of the 19th century. Today, \u201cMarx\u201d is a dirty word, as his name is attached to mass graves of millions of murder victims. But back then he was a normal ambitious but honest scientist. So, Marx wrote \u201cDas Kapital\u201d, first volume, believing he lays out a sound economic theory. It was published. Pretty much right away other scientists started to question the key claims and notions of \u201cDas Kapital, vol. 1\u201d. Not for some silly ideological squabbles, but simply because the math was not adding up. You know, this was about economy, book balancing is what economists are very insistent on, them beancounters. This stopped Marx in his tracks. He had volumes 2 and 3 ready in the manuscript, but now there was that pesky issue of the basic error in Volume 1, the very notion of \u201cvalue\u201d in economy. On which all the rest of Marx thought was based. So Marx refrained from publishing volumes 2 and 3 (he was honest, did I say this?) and until his death tried to prove his detractors wrong (did I say he was ambitious?). But he failed in that, as the detractors were right. So he died, and this should be an end of a yet another garden variety \u201cscientist being wrong\u201d story. By the end of 19th century no serious economist would bother with Marx, anymore than astronomers today bother with Ptolemy. A honorable place in the history books, that\u2019s all. Unfortunately, while the economy science value of Marx was crap, his \u201cDas Kapital\u201d provided and endless source of cut-and-paste slogans you could put on banners if you wanted to grab power for a nominally noble cause. Probably only the Bible or Koran were in the same league. So for the Russian Bolsheviks Marx was an ideal base. They could use Bible or Koran equally well, but they wanted to take power from a regime which was using Bible already, and Koran was written in Arabic, so Koran would be technically harder to use. Of course what helped, was that Marx and Bible are not that far off in many aspects, so the ideology transition in Russia was surprisingly smooth, in both directions at various times. Still, one cannot deny that Bolsheviks were careful. They bought for gold all Marx papers, gathering dust unread for half a century somewhere. So nobody could see that Marx himself was struggling and failing to defend his own theory. And they published, great fanfare, volumes 2, 3 and 4 (ghostwritten) of \u201cDas Kapital\u201d. It is a fascinating thing, that in Soviet Union and in other places there were whole departments and universities, crowds of professors, students, conferences, papers, books, you name it, on \u201cMarxist economy\u201d. This cries for an analysis. This is like having a whole branch of science and engineering devoted to development and applications of the Flat Earth theory. But it did exist, a massive \u201cscience\u201d sector in the Soviet Union and elsewhere. Incredible. Maybe one of explanations is that if the state is funding generously your job as a professor of the Marxist Economy at the Department of the Marxist Economy, will you mention that the Marxist Economy is a voodoo? Will you even see that? Mark Twain had a comment on this, \u201cit is hard for men to see something, if their paycheck depends on not seeing this something\u201d. And there was always the secret police. No burning at the stake, but equally effective measures. So nothing unusual in the fact that \u201cplanned economy\u201d, based on Marxist science principles, was a bit less than most successful.",

Tim was far from the only CEO to drop in to pick our brains. And with many more companies, the point of contact was the sales rep. Nobody in the business visited our business without talking business. After we folded the company, my partner, Steve, began a line of catalog companies for men\u2019s hats. Around year two, he decided a back section devoted to men\u2019s casual apparel would make for a good merchandising gimmick. He approached Tommy Bahama, the hottest line going at the time. They laughed at him. He continued to pester them, and after a couple of years, they agreed to give him a limited selection, which was all he wanted. They happened to notice that his picks, made in a scant fifteen minutes, turned out item-by-item to be their top sellers for the season. When he repeated that trick the next season, they started having him in as first buyer. Steve got to pick before all their other much longer-term and larger-sized customers. They then set their production runs based on his purchases and his comments on the styles he did not choose. This went on for years. In the schmata (\u201crag,\u201d as in clothing) business, staying ahead of trends can depend on just such quirks. Given the woes we\u2019d had trying to automate our business, I founded a software company to produce the impossible\u2014a universal retail inventory management and point of sale program. To give you an idea, Levi Strauss, the jeans company, had, back in the 80s, put $5 B into designing an apparel-design back-end system. The problem? Two, actually. One, it was an average 900 days from the cotton leaving the field to you walking out of the store carrying a pair of jeans made from that cotton. There was no fundamental reason it had to be more than 90 days. Half the price of a pair of jeans comes from financing the extra 810 days. Getting live data from the point of sale would set their production almost instantly, but, problem two: each of their 15,000 retailers had unique software requiring a custom interface. The overarching problem is that, outside of a few verticals, like supermarkets, the merchandise pipelines in this country are murky and sclerotic\u2026 and we are the best in the world!

The Soviet Union and East European countries have had disequilibrium in markets and chronic shortages of labor and commodities.The centrally planned economies of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have experienced severe imbalances in domestic and external markets over several decades. As a result, they have been chronically afflicted by problems such as excess demand, repressed inflation, deficits of commodities, queues, waiting lists, and forced savings.   These economies have not been able to sustain a performance comparable to the mixed market economies. In the Soviet Union, a relatively backward country was transformed into a major industrial economy. Still, the mechanisms of extensive heavy industrialization have proved incapable either of applying modern technological advances outside the military sector or of establishing a standard of consumption comparable to that in advanced capitalist countries. Many features of the Soviet system were reproduced in Eastern Europe, with broadly similar results, and with the burden of imposed political structures.The direct cause of bringing to life the necessity of the radical restructuring of the Soviet Union was the deterioration of the economic and social situation in the country in the 1970\u2032s and early 80\u2032s. At that time the rate of economic development slowed down sharply, economic disproportions increased, and the social needs of people ceased to be sufficiently satisfied. Negative trends, which developed at the watershed of the 1970\u2032s and the 1980\u2032s, resulted in economic stagnation, and the population\u2019s living standards began to drop. The country stood at the edge of an economic abyss.Quote A. AGANBEGYAN in favor of Perestroika: - Abel Aganbegyan - Wikipedia \u2018\u2019Having abandoned the old, distorted model of a socialist economy based on bureaucratic-centralist principles, on concentrating the management of economic life in the hands of the state and neglecting the social interests of the working people, we turn to a new model of a socialist society\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2019from an economy in which everything is in short supply, in which producers rule supreme, we intend to go over to an economy based on satisfying social needs, where producers strive for the fulfillment of the demands of consumers\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2019Second, we face the task of radically changing the factors and sources of economic growth, turning from the predominantly extensive type of development to the intensive one \u2018\u2019We will have to abandon the administrative-command system suppressing human initiative and turn to the use of economic mechanisms, far greater use of the market\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2019We are striving to relinquish the 'closed' economy directed to within the country and separated from the world, and go over to an open economy where our country will join the system of the world economy and the international market.\u2019\u2019"

Take a look at the science of winged flight and possible mechanisms by which a dragon might even breathe fire. To date, no fire-breathing animals have been found. However, it wouldn't be impossible for an animal to expel flames. The bombardier beetle (family Carabidae) stores hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide in its abdomen, which it ejects when threatened. The chemicals mix in the air and undergo an exothermic (heat-releasing) chemical reaction, essentially spraying the offender with irritating, boiling hot fluid. When you stop to think about it, living organisms produce flammable, reactive compounds and catalysts all the time. Even humans inhale more oxygen than they use. Hydrogen peroxide is a common metabolic by-product. Acids are used for digestion. Methane is a flammable by-product of digestion. Catalases improve the efficiency of chemical reactions.In myth, many dragons can fly and breathe fire. CoreyFord / Getty Images A dragon could store the necessary chemicals until it's time to use them, forcefully expel them, and ignite them either chemically or mechanically. Mechanical ignition could be as simple as generating a spark by crushing together piezoelectric crystals. Piezoelectric materials, like flammable chemicals, already exist in animals. Examples include tooth enamel and dentin, dry bone, and tendons.Draco is a small flying dragon found in Asia. 7activestudio / Getty Images So, breathing fire is certainly possible. It hasn't been observed, but that doesn't mean no species has ever developed the ability. However, it's just as likely an organism that shoots fire might do so from its anus or a specialized structure in its mouth. But That's not a Dragon! The heavily armored dragon portrayed in movies is (almost certainly) a myth. Heavy scales, spines, horns, and other bony protuberances would weigh a dragon down. However, if your ideal dragon has tiny wings, you can take heart in the realization that science doesn't yet have all the answers. After all, scientists didn't figure out how bumblebees fly until 2001. In summary, whether or not a dragon exists or can fly, eat people, or breathe fire really comes down to what you define a dragon to be.[1] Key PointsFlying \"dragons\" exist today and in the fossil record. They are not merely fantasy beasts.While wingless dragons wouldn't fly in the strict sense of the term, they could glide long distances without violating any laws of physics.Fire-breathing is unknown in the animal kingdom, but is theoretically possible. Many organisms produce flammable compounds, which could be stored, released, and ignited either by a chemical or a mechanical spark.Footnotes[1] Could Dragons Really Fly and Breath Fire?

            "One possible way: Their metabolism is capable of creating a low-boiling flammable liquid (such as diethyl ether or pentane) and this substance is stored in sacs somewhere in the head. The dragon also has an enzyme that acts to ignite the stuff when in contact with air. To breathe fire, the dragon pumps (by muscle action) some of this liquid out of its mouth; its own body heat evaporates it and the enzyme, sprayed out at the same time, sets it off.",

If they did, bees would be responsible for ripping apart time and space whenever they flew around. Aeroplanes can fly because of a careful balance of four physical forces: lift, drag, weight, and thrust. The lift force must balance its weight, and thrust must exceed its drag, to make flying possible. Planes use wings for lift and engines for thrust. Drag is reduced thanks to a streamlined shape, and lightweight materials. The wingspan of a plane is large enough to satisfy the lift equations for flight, so they don't need to flap. But the small wings of a bee compared to its relatively fat body are not. A regular Boeing 747 plane can also take off at roughly 184 mph, whereas bees do not reach anywhere near that speed. Due to low speeds, and the high amount of drag when bees flap their wings, it might look like they shouldn't be able to fly. In reality, they simply fly in a completely different way. Another study from 2005, by biology professor Michael Dickinson from the University of Washington, also concluded that bees flap their wings back and forth, not up and down. This was previously a big misconception about the way insects fly, and could have originally been what tripped Magnan up in the first place. An aeroplane's wing forces air down, which pushes the plane upwards. Insects sweep their wings in a partial spin. Rather than being like a propeller, the angle to the wing creates vortices in the air like small hurricanes. The eyes of these mini-hurricanes have a lower pressure than the air outside, which lifts the bees upwards. So the next time someone tells you a bee shouldn't be able to fly, you should inform them that this is merely a myth perpetuated by popular culture. In reality, bees simply create mini-hurricanes wherever they go, which is a lot easier to get your head around. https://www.livescience.com/33075-how-bees-fly.html Dickinson published a 2005 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the flight of the bumblebee after gathering data using high-speed photography of actual flying bees and force sensors on a larger-than-life robotic bee wing flapping around in mineral oil. He says the big misconception about insect flight and perhaps what tripped up Magnan is the belief that bumblebees flap their wings up and down. \"Actually, with rare exceptions, they flap their wings back and forth,\" Magnan said. The fluid dynamics behind bumblebees' flight are different from those that allow a plane to fly. An airplane's wing forces air down, which in turn pushes the wing (and the plane it's attached to) upward. For bugs, it isn't so simple. The wing sweeping is a bit like a partial spin of a \"somewhat crappy\" helicopter propeller, Dickinson said, but the angle to the wing also creates vortices in the airlike small hurricanes. The eyes of those mini-hurricanes have lower pressure than the surrounding air, so, keeping those eddies of air above its wings helps the bee stay aloft. Other studies have confirmed that bees can flyin one of the more colorful projects, in 2001, a Chinese research team led by Lijang Zeng of Tsinghua University glued small pieces of glass to bees and then tracked reflected light as they flew around in a laser array. But now, Dickinson says, researchers are more interested in the finer points of how insects control themselves once they're in the air. Those studies will be especially important for a fleet of robotic insects in development, including robobees created by a team at Harvard University. Theory of Flight The Physics of. . .

Prove why this is wrong. 1st approach 6th grader can understand (some language are vague, if u r looking for advanced stuffs, skip this) The same Physics apply to a bee compared to an airplane on how \u201clift\u201d works. But there is no Physics that I learnt so far can explain the tiny wings phenomenon. Animals can fly due to the pressure difference between the top of their wings and bottom of their wings Imagine the wing of an airplane, where the top part is curved while the bottom part is flatter. Since the top surface of an airfoil is curved upwards, the air has to travel a longer distance in the same time as it travels over the wing than beneath it (since there\u2019re pre-existing air molecules above the wing), so the speed increases and there\u2019s a decrease in pressure above the wing in which causes a lift. Well then what is pressure and why is pressure related? Blow a balloon with full of air, seal it tight and try to squeeze it, what you feel is pressure. Pressure decreases if the flow/speed of something increases (wait...how?). Now use that same balloon, but this time let go of its air while squeezing it, there is less pressure. So, the flow rate of air (aka the speed of air) increases when the pressure decreases. Well what does all this have to do with the bee that flies. The bottom of the wing of an airplane is flatter than the top, meaning the pressure at the bottom is greater than the top. Pressure is defined in Physics as Force divided by Area (P = F/A). what's force? gravity that gives you mass is a force. Anyway, the greater the gravity, the lower you can jump (imagine being in space, where there's no gravity, you can jump to another planet) so greater force means greater pressure and lower pressure means smaller force. Therefore, an airplane or a bee can fly. 2nd way to teach a 10th grade student. Again, animals can fly due to the pressure difference between the top of their wings and bottom of their wings Note that \u201cthe pressure that exists inside the stream of water (pushing outward against air pressure) as it flies toward the building is different from the pressure caused when the water strikes the building and changes momentum due to a collision.\u201d (Khan Academy). Note that I ll be talking about the pressure inside the stream of water. Consider the Venturi Effect, where a wide tunnel narrows. The Venturi Effect shows that the velocity of the fluid increases as it flows thru a narrower tube while the pressure decreases, due to conservation of energy and the Volume Flow Rate equation. In order to conserve energy, the pressure on the right side of the equation must be lower in order to increase the velocity of liquid based on the Bernoulli\u2019s equation. Since the velocity increases with a lower pressure, a \u201clift\u201d occurs.",
            "A very long time ago, before we knew much about flight, a mathematician used a crude and inaccurate formula and applied it inappropriately to bumblebees. He then declared that bumblebees cannot fly. Obviously they can and do fly so the maths is wrong. Today we have both sophisticated maths for flight and improved anatomical knowledge about how insect wings work. No modern mathematician or engineer would claim that any insect cannot fly.",

My heart and sympathy also goes out to the families and friends of those killed by air pollution in China yesterday. The best estimate is 4400 people die every day from that tragedy in China alone. That's about 13,200 over the past three days.  My heart and sympathy goes out to the families and friends of those killed in automobile accidents in the United States. The best estimate is that in the past three days about 330 people died from such accidents in the US alone, most of them completely unexpected and tragic. My heart and sympathy goes out to the families and friends of those that died in the last three days in Africa from AIDS; the best estimate is that 12,000 people died of this tragedy in Africa alone during that time period.  The murder rate in New York City is about 31 per year, per 100,000 residents.  With a population of 8 million, that translates to about 2500 per year.  In the last three days, we would calculate that 20 people were murdered in NYC alone. My heart and sympathy goes out to the families and friends of those who have been murdered.   Yes, we need to show sympathy and solidarity to all the families and friends of people who die suddenly and tragically.  A reasonable question: why do we focus so much on the terrorist attacks and not on these other tragedies, particularly since the numbers killed by the other tragedies is so much higher? Out of fear?  Let's put that in perspective. Suppose I knew that there was going to be a terrorist attack in London in the next week. Would I stay away?  Let's assume that 31 people will be killed, just as in Brussels. The population of greater London is about 8.5 million people. That means my odds of being killed are 31/8.5million = 0.000004. That is such an incredibly small number that I would not hesitate to travel to London next week.  Why do we focus so much attention on the terrorist attacks? The reason, of course, is that we find them compelling stories, full of tragedy and mystery and danger. But we need to keep them in perspective. In my mind, the right response to the terrorist attacks is to assign very good police investigators to finding the perpetrators, arresting them, and putting them on trial.  But in terms of danger to life, they represent a tiny threat, even to those living in the target cities.  Of course, the whole goal of a terrorist attack is to spread terror, and they are effective in doing so.  Although it might be argued that the people who spread the terror are the newspapers, TV, the politicians, the pundits who think we should put a much larger fraction of our focus on these attacks rather than on the multiplicity of other tragedies that bring vastly greater death and heartache and pain to the world.   When our public leaders announce \"solidarity against terrorism\", the terrorists feel that they have accomplished their goal. Our leaders have decided to place terrorism at the top of the political/diplomatic agenda, far out of proportion to the harm that it actually achieves. The terrorist leaders were seeking such attention, and we are complying.   Arguably, the best response of a politician would be: terrorism is the last refuge of a weak and failing cause. It is what people do when they are helpless and they are losing. Let us give sympathy to the friends and families who die, but not focus in on them (and the injured too) to the exclusion of the other tragedies that surround us every day; let's not change our lifestyles or our beliefs in human rights (especially on how to treat minorities associated with he attacks). Let's just assign some good policemen to the \"multiple murder\" and do our best to punish the perpetrators, as we do for any other murder. But we must not act irrationally by letting ourselves be \"terrorized\".  In the early 1900s, the terrorists of that period were called \"anarchists\", and their icon was the small round black bomb with a fuse. Such a bomb attack failed to kill Archduke Ferdinand, but a short time later a bullet did the job. That event was so blown out of proportion that it served as the trigger for World War I. Let's not let terrorist events today have a similarly exaggerated response.  The population should recognize that these attacks don't represent a new and huge threat. They are minor, compared not only to the other threats that surround us, but even on an absolute scale. If we focus on terrorism, if we make headlines, if we react by changing the way we live, then we are giving the terrorists exactly what they had hoped for. That is the worst irony.  In our fury, we fulfill the terrorists' wishes. The ultimate answer to the terrorists is not to capture them or to punish them. They have already shown that they are willing to commit suicide. The ultimate answer is to put these attacks into the proper perspective, and regard them for what they really are: tragic to individuals and their families, but tiny compared to the multitude of other tragedies to individuals and families that is part of current everyday life.  If we stop over-responding to terrorist attacks, we take away their value to the terrorists. ",

It is simply not acceptable from anyone to commit such acts of murderous violence anywhere. Looking at the big picture, the main target of the attacks in Paris and Brussels seems to me to be the European public opinion. There is a big shift taking place. The mood is swaying towards right wing politics. Hatred and suspicion of Islam and Muslims is greatly increasing. Rejection of immigrants and refugees is very much on the rise. It is easy to see that if further attacks take place, it is very probable that this public opinion will start asking for and supporting active participation in fights against perceived Muslim threats locally and abroad. It might even encourage direct military action. Perhaps that is the intention in the first place. That is to use these attacks to drag Europe into active participation in a war against Islam and Muslims. Who benefits from such an undertaking? I would suggest the US. It was the US that started basing its foreign policy goals around the issue of fighting terrorism after the events of 9/11. After the fall of the USSR, it needed a new enemy to keep its interests and foreign policy goals on the move. So, it targeted Islam and Muslims. For centuries, Muslims have been around and never engaged in such atrocities. There was never such groups mindlessly planning and causing mayhem and linking it with Islam. Recent history shows that these groups starting to really pop up after the intervention of the USSR in Afghanistan, and the push by the US to fight the USSR through the use of jihadist groups as they will be the most motivated to repel infidel Russian invaders from Afghanistan, and they did, supported, helped and controlled by the US. After that, we started seeing these different groups being used to commit different acts which actually served the interests of the US and justified its intervention in many parts of the world in the name of fighting terrorism. Among that the intervention in Somalia, the intervention in Iraq (together with the lie of weapons of mass destruction). And now the intervention by proxy in Syria and Iraq through client regimes such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and UAE. The use of proxies by the US has been evident in the last few years as it gets the job done without the need to compromise US internal politics and with substantially less cost. Therefore, the attacks taking place in Europe are not merely random attacks of ideological violence. They are political actions that actually serve a purpose and looks to be part of bigger strategy conceived, controlled and run by the US establishment. On another point, there is a need to look for and solve the root cause of the issue of the existence of so-called jihadists whether in Europe or elsewhere. There is an important issue that needs resolving for without it even if ISIS is destroyed another will take its place. The issue is the blind support of corrupt regimes in the Muslim world. Regimes such as the one in Egypt were everyone knows that a military coup took place and the old regime, that a revolution took place to take down, came back to power. Massacres took place in Cairo and Alexandria, however, the world including Europe recognized this murderous regime and gave it a diplomatic umbrella and keeps (and still does) a blind eye on its atrocities and the number of people that it just keep adding to its growing number of jails. The estimate is that there are 40 thousand people in jails. They build jails there but they do not build hospitals or schools. The Europeans keep supplying it with arms and support despite of its clear blood thirsty nature. Similarly, the corrupt regimes in the middle east which all run police states are supported and continuously helped and welcomed into the so-called international community despite their corrupt nature and dismal records in human rights abuses. No real pressure is put on these regimes to become human friendly. These family-based regimes consider the countries their own farms which they do whatever they want. None of them are actually elected. The west goes along with them and in return gets all the contracts for oil, weapons and preferential treatment while the common man in these countries suffer daily from the atrocities of the police states there and dare not demand the least of his rights.This is the environment that is there that ISIS easily finds its recruits from.Add to that the very slow action towards the murderous regime in Syria, the destruction of Iraq through the lie of weapons of mass destruction and then the appointment of a very corrupt government there, and you have extra incentive to a lot of people to join ISIS out of desperation and for vengeance.If Europe keeps ignoring these issues then definitely it should not be surprised that this \"New Norm\" becomes the \"Standard Norm\". In this standard norm, the loser is humanity but as the saying goes you reap what you sow.",

There was a man who fell into a concrete pour during the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge; that became his tomb. In essence the Golden Gate bridge is one of the largest modern day tomb. I read about this a long time ago and I have not been able to find any new and current reference to the guy entombed in concrete. Sorry, this is probably another tall tale hoax. I always thought of this tidbit of trivia that was cool, but it is not true. Now I have to search Quora for another answer about the Golden Gate Bridge where I have accidentally perpetuated the hoax. Once concrete is poured it starts to set, a concrete pour section must cool off and set as evenly as possible. You don't and can't stop a pour, there is more fresh concrete coming, it can't stop until the section has been poured. Fun Facts As concrete sets it actually heats up rather than cool off. As the heating process decreases then the concrete actually cools off. If the heat from curing concrete of Hoover Dam could be concentrated into a baking oven, you could bake 500,000 loaves of bread daily for 3 years. Wow!
