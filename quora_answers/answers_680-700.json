And it would apply to reading in general (and not be limited only to books) Reading helps you become a well-informed, rounded person.I now know that the world is not black-and-white. That people are not always who they seem to be. I have decent knowledge of the working of human psychology, of why economies crumble, why increasing the minimum wage is not a good idea, of social media strategies, of the dangers of religious extremism, of how governments are elected, what Bitcoin is, how Elon Musk is changing the frontier of science and technology, on what makes a particular song good.\u201cI cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.\u201d \u2015 Ralph Waldo EmersonEvery human being has limits. You always have to build upon what others already have. You cannot always expect to start with a blank slate. \"Whenever you read a good book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light.\"\u2013Vera NazarianYou can hold your own in a conversation and add to it. If you are in a professional setting and people start talking about a particular topic, you can make them notice you only if you truly know something about the topic that they do not. You can impress them, you can astound them, you can assert dominance (like Will did).You are never truly aloneEven if you are all by yourself on a lazy weekend, and none of your friends are available, you can pick up a book and spend time with its characters. You can be sitting in your room, but be totally immersed in a fantastical, fictional land.Vicarious experiencesAdmit it. You will never be able to do everything you want to. Especially things that are restricted by your physical limitations as a human being. But when you read, you can be a renaissance painter in the 12th century, or an explorer conquering the Everest. You could be the deadliest sniper in the armed forces or a 5 year old kid with a stuffed tiger and a whole bunch of philosophical questions. \"A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called \u201cleaves\u201d) imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance at it and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, the author is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, who never knew one another. Books break the shackles of time\u2014proof that humans can work magic. \"\u2014 Carl SaganYou can travel in space. And in time. To a far off land. To another dimension. You can walk on the surface of the sun. Or waltz past the orbit of Pluto. You can be the leader of a utopian society in the 53rd century. Or the final sum of all of human consciousness.\u201cA reader lives a thousand lives before he dies. The man who never reads lives only one.\u201d \u2015 Jojen Reed, A Dance with DragonsIt's a great stress busterApart from writing, music, and cooking, reading is my favorite stress buster. And it has been proven that \"even 6 minutes of reading can help reduce stress levels by 66%\".(Read: Reading 'can help reduce stress' )And a great escape. When you come back home after a long day of work, you will find solace in the fact that the cupboard in your room might be the secret entrance to a mystery land. Or sift through your desk trying to look for a letter offering you admission in a secret school for wizards.  It can help you embrace your emotional self, and connect with your inner self.While I was on a vacation a few months back, I read a lot of books. I also finished To Kill a Mockingbird; something I had been trying to for quite some time. After finally putting the book down, I spent the next few hours lying down, gaze fixed on the empty, blue sky. A lot of thoughts were born, some were lost, some retained. I found myself thinking about stuff I usually don't. I contemplated my life. What I wanted to be. Where have I arrived. I sensed reconnecting with my inner self. Something that I hadn't done in a long time. And help put a lot of things in perspectiveWe normally live in silos. We have a distorted view of reality, and an oft exaggerated perception of our own problems. When you feel your life is unfair, pick up the Diary of Anne Frank of the chronicles of Malala. When you are feeling complacent, pick up the autobiography of a great business/political leader. When you are feeling thankless, start reading on the Civil Right's movement, the Indian Independence struggle, or the experiences of someone who has survived a natural/man-made tragedy.\u201cYou think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had ever been alive.\u201d \u2015 James BaldwinA seemingly random string of words has the ability to lift our spirits, and at the same time, show us how truly insignificant our achievements and problems are.\u201cFairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\u201d \u2015 Neil Gaiman, CoralineIf only people read more, there wouldn't be conflicts, riots, or protests. People would understand that killing in the name of religion is not fine, that there is nothing wrong with loving a person of the same sex, or loving multiple people, or choosing to be asexual. People would embrace differences, and be more amenable.Finally, reading is what make you, you. You are not a body, or a chemical mixture. You are not the cells in your body, or the space you occupy. You are your consciousness, your memories, your feelings, your fears, your aspirations, your lost chances. In essence, you are the sum total of all your experiences. So make them worthwhile. \"And all you touch and all you see. Is all your life will ever be.\"  - Breathe, Pink Floyd",

Books can break this barrier and elevate your wisdom.A wise man is always respected. When you show immense knowledge, people turn to you for your opinions in decision making. You are an alpha amongst the largely unread crowd. Your sharp acumen means you can quickly rise to the top. Choosing the right book is important. Extensive reading in various genres has its own advantages:History and political books will make you shrewd and help you move crowds and win arguments.Science books will give you insights into the unknown.Biographies of eminent people will help you improve your personality.Philosophy will morally enlighten you.Fantasy fiction will entice your imagination.Crime fiction will enhance logical reasoning.Adventure novels will give you unknown and unforeseen experiences.Religious books will give you philosophical views of various belief systems of the world, and their search for the meaning of creation.Reading can make you travel through dimensions. You forget your world and move into a world created by the author. You let your mind wander into worlds where no man has gone. You begin to interact with ideas and characters at the subconscious level. At this level you've created banks of data to help you deal with real world problems far more effectively than the man who does not read.",
            "Here are some of the reasons:It gives you empathy. Imagination creates and increases the understanding power in a human. Multiple stories have shown that imagining stories helps activates the region of the human brain which is responsible for better understanding and seeing the world from a new and different perspective. For example, YA Books tackle the edgy teen issues that the teenagers struggle with, from peer pressure and romantic longing to grief and trouble at home or school. When you read such books you understand such situations better and can act more maturely and wisely.2. Reading heContinue ReadingHere are some of the reasons:It gives you empathy.

When you read such books you understand such situations better and can act more maturely and wisely.2. Reading helps in reducing stress. It helps you to disengage yourself from the real world and dive into a new creative one. From recent studies, it has been proven that reading helps to put our brain into pleasurable state- like a state similar to meditation. It brings the same health benefits of deep relaxation and inner calmness.3. Better Sleep: Regular readers sleep better. Creating a sleep ritual of reading at least some pages of a book can be a great way to build up a consistent sleep pattern for you. 4. Better relationships: Books and novels of a particular genre teach you a lot of relationships, heartbreaks and love. They tend to change the perspective of a person towards the human emotions and broadens their minds as well. 5. Better Memory: Readers have less mental health decline in the future in comparison to the people who don\u2019t read at all. They experience a slower memory decline in the future. 6. Stories open up your mind. Can reading Harry Potter make us more inclusive, tolerant and open minded? Hasn\u2019t Austen and Bronte sisters helped us to open up our minds and accept new changes that keep on happening in the world? 7. Vocabulary: I have received many messages where people ask me how they can develop their vocabulary, my answer to them is reading books. You come across so many new words that can help you express yourself in a much better way. 8. Reading makes you happier. At the end of the day, reading gives people happiness. If I speak for myself, it\u2019s peace for me. Reading is actually meditation for me and I feel the most peaceful place for me in this whole world is the bookstores and libraries.Hope it helps :)",

A mysterious virtual world, loaded with the darkest secrets of humanity, Mecca of people seeking an adventure sitting at home. First came across the term when I went for a MUN a year ago about Contraband Trafficking. (I am 'unexplainably' good at MUNs that's different.) Back then the word made no sense to me. What I cannot access how do I know what it is? I was too ignorant back then to even put decent research in this topic. Months later when I joined Quora, I came across an answer in my feed about The Deep Web (or Dark Web, I'll be using the terms interchangeably). There were many interesting links posted, mostly about illegal things. So I downloaded TOR on my phone, as was suggested by the answer(you need both Orbot and Orfox from the Play Store). So I began to copy paste links from the answers on Quora. (There are many answers providing links). Most of them are dead, because the deep web sites keep shifting from one URL to the other and they are too complex to be kept in memory. On the first day (rather night)I found these things:Online anonymous chat for people using deep web.1000000+ warnings about child porn saying it's illegal. 1000000++1 people in chat rooms wanting links for child porn sites.Used DuckDuck Go search because Google tracks you.Got notEvil, a TOR search engine.Day by day I discovered more:A guns and ammo store. Was really excited to find it, it was starting to get illegal.A site selling Kamagra, a Viagra. Wasn't that interesting.Site selling stashed iPhone and electronics.From this I got the link to a drug trading site. Had fun browsing.Another link to a site where you can apparently hire Hitmen to do the dirty job for you.Then comes the real deal. I found a site, claiming to supply forbidden information. I found there stuff as:Lock picking tutorial. A text file. (Don't worry, it's too absurd to try it. You need a lockpick for it and I haven't got any idea how to buy one)Burglary, robbing, shoplifting tutorials. All text files.Tutorial on practical necrophilia, titled \u201cHow to F*ck the Dead\u201d Interesting little text file.Tutorials on cannibalism, how one butchers a human corpse for human consumption, the criterion for choosing the right \u201canimal\u201d and how to treat it before killing. You get a bonus recipe too, for cooking it. Was reading it in a public bus, feeling like an anarchist plotting his move.Tutorials on fighting , being a Hitman, assassination guides.Entire collection of Islamic propaganda Dabiq magazine.Jihad Snuff Videos- The ones where people are shot and beheaded. Got them in a torrent. Watching one disgusted me so much I got rid of them in one go. This really makes you feel the reality of terrorism even when you are sitting in the comfort of your home. I have never seen anything so horrible.There are more to that site I haven't found all of them.Here are some more things I found on while I was searching the deep web with notEvil:Porn: the ones on the deep web are nothing special, just like surface web sites though they load slower in deep web because of the multiple proxy servers.Tried search for ebooks. Got a good collection of Indian history books PDF form by RC Mukherjee. Now it feels like a gold mine.Sites which claim to supply counterfeit driving licences, ID proofs, credit cards and other fake IDs.Child porn. Yea a debated topic. You keep on hearing about sites like Lolita City but they are most probably closed now because the people behind these sites have been but behind the bars. However, I came across child nudity when I least expected to. I searched for Vintage and I ended up with child porn. :3 Never visited that site again. Cops come on, they are right under your noses. How can you allow anyone to do that to children\u2026.Official site of TPB (the pirate bay) .This is basically all I've come across. There are more things to be be found. Lets see. I've heard warnings like \u201cthe police can still track you if they want to\u201d but then browsing is not illegal unless you purchase things. Thanks for reading. Would greatly appreciate if factual inaccuracies, if any, are reported in the comments :) Edit 1: Nowadays the darknet seems very boring. I generally use Not Evil now, when I connect to the Tor Network. Most of the search results lead to dead links. However I still found a website, which is worth visiting. Imperial Library of Trantor: Very nice place to get free e-books. Feels good to explore. The books can be read online or downloaded in epub format. I'll add new information whenever I get useful or interesting sites. Edit 2: After a long, long time. I happened to browse the deepweb. This time I started with the deepweb search engine Not Evil. Kinda regular stuff I do. However this time I noticed a button on the engine page, which was of some sort of a game. When the page opened it was actually a place for people to chat, anonymously. There I happened to find a link which the person who posted said was of a deepweb directory. Yeah, it wasn't fake and the website opened. It had links to quite a lot of useful sites like fake temporary email sites and Bitcoin mining sites, etc. Then there was a filter kind of thing which had a check box written \u201cshow immoral content\u201d. For the sake of exploration I clicked it. And it turned out as I had expected: porn and even child porn site links. So you see, this sick thing is still on. But we haven't reached the sickest part, yet. There happened to be a site called \u2026(okay I won't say), which as the description said, was the Xvideos (do I need to elaborate on what it is?) of the deepweb. I clicked on it and viola! I lose my sleep for 2 days, as of now. What I see is horrible, horrific, terrible. Series of video thumbnails of horrific terrifying images. The shock I received set my heart racing. In the brief period of not more than 10 seconds I see titles like \u201cRape and Death\u201d, \u201cRape\u201d, \u201cChild\u201d, \u201cAutopsy\u201d and boy I was s*hit scared. The images that flashed on my laptop screen made me think, how sick can people be, to engage in such nonsense and then film it?! I couldn't dare to scroll beyond and ran the f*ck off by directly closing my Tor Browser window. To this end, I am not going to reveal the name of the website due to ethical reasons. I do not endorse anything I state here, nor do I urge anyone to explore the deepweb. I meagrely share my experiences and I thank you readers for patiently reading them. None of my answers are so highly upvoted as this one!",
            "Curiosity killed the cat. I visited the dark web around 2014, and my experiences were unpleasant to say the least. For starters, all websites look horrible, with bad color palettes, bad designs. It is as if web designers from the 1990s (bad ones) travelled to the year 2014 and decided to make websites for the dark web. I visited a forum where people asked all kinds of questions.

For starters, all websites look horrible, with bad color palettes, bad designs. It is as if web designers from the 1990s (bad ones) travelled to the year 2014 and decided to make websites for the dark web. I visited a forum where people asked all kinds of questions. There were people asking about red rooms (rooms where a person is tortured, and you can participate in such torture by contributing with ideas or requests). That means there were forum members asking about rooms where people were being tortured live. And there were also people asking where in the dark web they could find the video Daisy\u2019s Destruction, a video where a little filipino girl (18 months old) was sexually tortured. The creator of the video, Peter Scully, is now serving a life-sentence in the Philippines. Why would anyone want to watch such a monstrosity? The Dark Web is a fine example that there are a lot of monsters out there. Imagine the psychological damage done to a normal person who dared to watch Daisy\u2019s destruction, and I am sure that\u2019s not the only sick video you can find in the dark web, for it is the place where Mexican cartels and ISIS upload the horrible videos they make. Of course, there were forum members asking about monsters, UFOs, CIA and FBI files, as if the dark web had information you cannot find in the regular web. I stumbled into a website where people make fake documents, like passports, drivers\u2019 licenses, and birth-certificates. I also found a website where people can buy machine guns. But what did it for me, and drove me out of there, never to return again, was porn. I found a picture of a hot and very naked blond woman, and I clicked on it because I wanted to see more of her. And I found more porn, all right, just not what I expected. After that, I deleted TOR (the browser used to surf the dark web) for good. The dark web makes you wonder if there are people close to you browsing those sites and enjoying themselves. Maybe it is the guy smiling at you at the checkout counter. Maybe it is your neighbor, or the girl you are dating. It made me feel paranoid. It made me feel dirty and dark for using it. Avoid the dark web. It is nothing but ugly websites, for ugly people.",
            "I have been browsing deep web for about 4 years and more maybe if I remember correctly. What's there to see on the dark web, 90's styled web pages, hard to see text due to minimized TOR browser window, no video playing, no downloading (it's a self imposed restriction though). From here things can go anyway you want.Pedophilia - Humanity at it\u2019s worst.Hitmen for hire - For 10 grands or so get rid of anybody you want with some terms and conditions like the victim should be older than 16 and not be a famous politician etc.Drug trafficking - It\u2019s just like buying stuff from Amazon.

What's there to see on the dark web, 90's styled web pages, hard to see text due to minimized TOR browser window, no video playing, no downloading (it's a self imposed restriction though). From here things can go anyway you want.Pedophilia - Humanity at it\u2019s worst.Hitmen for hire - For 10 grands or so get rid of anybody you want with some terms and conditions like the victim should be older than 16 and not be a famous politician etc.Drug trafficking - It\u2019s just like buying stuff from Amazon. Doorstep delivery of drugs in vacuum packed packages by post, so that it is undetected during the delivery process.Arms and weapons - You name it, you have it.Unsettling guides and tutorials - Like how to cook people and other unmentionable things.Human trafficking - I think this doesn\u2019t happen but there are sites claiming it and we are dealing with dark web here. It never fails to surprise.Torture and stuff - Though many videos, pictures are fake and have been debunked in past but hey! who is interested anyway.Things which other answers pointed out like fake id's, citizenship, money laundering services are also available if you know where and who to find.Dark web is not only about creepy stuff, on first sight, it may seem preposterous , but people discuss complex maths, science on scientific forums. No code language, pure academic stuff with legit mathematicians and scientists sharing their views.So to summarize, I did witnessed some of the things deep web is notorious for (except for red rooms, for which I thank god everyday). The experience was pretty sick and nasty. Months of depression followed after every encounter of a disturbing thing, this messed up world of dark web has to offer, Specially for an unsuspecting and unprepared teen. It is difficult that you may stumble across any of the aforementioned \"stuff\" today because these kinds of websites or links are being regularly taken down by not only cyber police, FBI or other government agencies but also by hacking groups like Anonymous and others. Also \"such\" links keep on bouncing every day or so. Many of the links in The hidden Wiki and other similar sites are dead or broken. So maybe you are not gonna find anything \u201cinteresting\u201d even after exploring for a substantial amount of time. In my case I made some friends (on one of those anonymous chat rooms) who knew a lot about the dark web, and told me, where to find what (i.e. working links, sometimes passwords too for some exclusive sites etc). But take this from me, visiting illegal links just for curiosity or fun is not a risk worth taking. You should avoid it, for your own good, literally and figuratively. Protip : If you\u2019ve decided to do something illegal or make a lot of enemies out on the Dark Web, a better plan is to use a proxy connection rather than a VPN. Also using a VPN may compromise the security and anonymity provided by TOR, more on that some other day. All these years have taught me that many of the creepy, horror stories revolving around dark web are made up, maybe not completely wrong but exaggerated for sure. Like they say...So if curiosity is killing you, go ahead and download TOR and have a look around. You might actually find that the dark net isn\u2019t nearly as much of a red light district as you heard. But who knows maybe you\u2019ll stumble upon something interesting one day and it will give you an idea on how to develop your own \u201cDeep Web Horror Story\u201d. Just remember to make it entertaining because everyone loves a tall tale!P.S. - Don't use Windows to access the dark web, Linux will be a safer, better choice. Simply because of the of the number of \u201cback doors\u201d in Windows. Trust me on this, the most innocent thing that would happen if someone from Dark web is on your PC is that your system will be a part of DDoS attack, and it's the best case scenario, things only get worse from there. Edit 1: Had to delete images and censor my original answer as quora collapsed it. Kudos to guys at \u201cCollapse Detectives\u201d.",

About 15 seconds later the server dropped. Edit:Merci @Johnny Fraisse for the French translation. My first one ever.Thanks @Antonio Ferraro for the Italian translation. I feel honored."

For example:Brain: The brain is the most sensitive to oxygen deprivation and typically ceases functioning shortly after the heart stops beating.Heart: The heart can continue to beat for a short time after clinical death if provided with oxygen and appropriate medical intervention.Skin cells: Skin cells can remain viable for a few hours after death, which is why some post-mortem processes, like taking fingerprints, can be done during this time.Muscle cells: Muscle cells can remain viable for several hours after death, which can affect the post-mortem stiffening of the body (rigor mortis).Certain internal organs: In some cases, internal organs like the liver and kidneys may remain functional for a brief period after clinical death, especially if the person is on life support.It's important to note that the concept of organs \"dying\" after death is somewhat different from the irreversible cessation of all vital functions, which is typically what is meant by clinical death. The exact timeline of organ shutdown can vary widely from case to case and is influenced by numerous factors.",
            "In a deceased human body, the brain is generally considered to be the last organ to die. Even after the heart stops beating and breathing ceases, brain activity can persist for a short period, although it gradually declines and eventually stops. When the heart stops pumping blood, the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients. Without a constant supply of oxygen and glucose, brain cells begin to die. However, some brain cells may remain viable for a brief period, and in some cases, there may be residual electrical activity in the brain even after the heart has stopped.

Even after the heart stops beating and breathing ceases, brain activity can persist for a short period, although it gradually declines and eventually stops. When the heart stops pumping blood, the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients. Without a constant supply of oxygen and glucose, brain cells begin to die. However, some brain cells may remain viable for a brief period, and in some cases, there may be residual electrical activity in the brain even after the heart has stopped. The duration of this process can vary depending on factors such as the cause of death, individual health conditions, and how quickly medical intervention is administered. Generally, after a few minutes of cardiac arrest, irreversible damage to brain cells occurs, leading to brain death and complete cessation of brain activity. It's important to note that medical professionals determine death based on specific criteria, which may vary depending on regional laws and medical protocols. In situations where brain activity has ceased irreversibly, a person is considered clinically and legally deceased."

It makes me think that as a society, we have become so utterly jaded that what we think of egocentric requited love is analogous to what a westerner thinks of magic in the Harry Potter series.

Here are 3 things that immediately popped up in my head after seeing this question:- 1- We throw a party one week after a baby is born. You may think of a baby shower when you hear this. But we have a few \u2026 bizarre twists to it. So everyone comes to the party with gifts and so. Then the interesting part starts. The baby is placed on the ground like this:-And everyone starts walking around him in a circle while holding candles. You see that metal tool a lady is holding in the picture above? It makes a sound kind of like a bell. So someone keeps \u201cringing\u201d it as everyone shouts wishes for the child \u201cI hope you're always healthy and well\u201d. \u201cI hope you always obey your mother\". Someone would interfere jokingly and shout \u201cbut never listen to your aunt, she's no good\". Everyone laughs and keep shouting wishes. Then another interesting tradition takes place. As you see above, the baby is placed on the floor, then the mother comes and starts stepping over the child. No harm whatsoever is done, she just walks on top of him as in this picture:-Then she walks back and forth taking seven steps as everyone shouts \u201cthe first step bismillah (in the name of god), the second step bismillah, the third step\u2026\u201d and so on. It involves a lot of candy, songs, and fun. 2-Egyptians tend to give fake invitations and we all know they are fake yet we have to go with the flow. Take this example:-Me: how much is this scarf? A vendor:- take it for free! Me:- no way, just tell me how much. A vendor:- I swear you should take it for free. Me:- thank you so much but I can't, how much? Him finally:- for 60 pounds.So in the example above, he absolutely does not mean I should take it for free. If I did he'll probably chase me. It's just an Egyptian thing to drop a few invitations to show that you're polite and generous. As I'm writing this answer, this following situation literally happened in front of me:-Two of my coworkers are chatting, one is travelling tonight. Person A:- dude, who's dropping you off? Person B:- oh just a taxi. Person A:- no way, I'll drop you off, man! Person B:- No, no I'm really fine with a taxi. Person A:- I insist I should help you. Person B:- I'm very thankful but I have to reject. Literally the moment person B leaves the room my other coworker comes and tells me : \u201cthank god he didn't accept it, I have a hard time driving at night\".Now don't get me wrong, if my coworker took up on the offer, he wouldn't have been thrown in the street or something. And the first one will probably force himself to go drop him off ... but this invitation is mostly just for politeness\u2019 sake and is often meant to be rejected. So when do you know that an Egyptian is truly inviting you? Probably when he swears for five times or more! 3- After a wedding night, on the first day of the newlyweds' marriage, the whole family will drop over for breakfast, bringing food with them, and sit with the couple for a while. Not only that but for the next few months the couple will receive so many guests congratulating them on the marriage and here is the strange part: the couple is expected to show them every single room in the house and take them in a tour to look at everything. In some rural areas that includes opening the drawers and cabinets too! I hope that was that informative !",

Others have covered the US variety (now my home) quite amply. To whom it may not obvious, this is a 40K' caricature, not a national self-portrait. It's also a work in progress; the national mindsets have changed more in the last 20 years than in the previous 400. That said:Russia is set up for graft. Public services are typically mildly crappy to shitty awful at their jobs, but rather efficient at extracting bribes and kickbacks. This is pervasive enough to be essentially assumed - a mindset that's really getting in the way of things. If a typical business were to pay its full tax burden, it would exceed 100% of its revenue. Doing profitable business in Russia virtually guarantees breaking some law. That's not an error - no, quite intentional.Russians are exquisitely apprehensive of the authorities. Follows from the above + centuries of the state proactively doing vox populi, to put it mildly, no good at all. One develops a strong set of circumnavigation skills to get around the virtually completely broken system. Outside of the country, the Russians tend to stand out for their lack of respect for the law.Both the people, and the nation are quite sociopathic. The level of gross, flaunted disregard for human life and its quality would cause you cognitive dissonance had you had to deal with it. May you never have to.Russians can be embarrassingly generous when you're down on luck, but are world champions in schadenfreude when you're successful. Borrowing and lending money is de rigeur - everyone makes do. When you have money, lend it, so when (rather expectedly, actually) you don't, you could borrow. The wheel keeps turning. However, should you make a stand-out sum, it's subliminally \"understood\" it was made by questionable means, and your downfall, should it come, is widely welcome.The president (czar, really) of the country is the former head of the ChKa/NKVD/KGB/FSB - the organization that ran logistics of the self-genocide that gutted the country over the 20th century, and hadn't even publicly admitted it yet. Yes, he did rig the latest elections, but his actual numbers are still over 50%. The relationship between majority of the population and the czar can best be described as suffering from the Stockholm syndrom. It's been the case throughout the country's history.Inflamed national pride is combined with an impressive lack of knowledge of own history. Not a surprise, given that most of us over a certain age grew up in what remained of a totalitarian propaganda bubble. That said, if you listened to what was being taught in schools as the \"history\" of Russia in the 20th century, you'd wonder if parallel universes actually existed. To wit, the Second World War (known to us as \"Great Patriotic War (term)\") unexpectedly begun on Jun 22, 1941, when the evil Wermacht ruthlessly attacked the peaceful Soviet Union. The Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact became public knowledge only in 1988, and caused a riot. Stalin was an effective leader. His purges are justified by the industrialization that he undertook. The 1917 Bolshevik Revolution (\"The Great October Revolution\" to us) wasn't a well-timed coup by a fairly fringe fraction, it was a massive popular uprising, akin to the French Revolution. Etc, etc. Granted, re-writing of history is not a Russian invention - the US school \"history\" of the Second World War is equally gutted the other way - but the scale and scope are amazing. Meanwhile, the former military intelligence colonel who had proposed that right before Operation Barbarossa began, Stalin was in preparations of an offensive war in Europe, is under witness protection in the UK, sentenced to death for treason in absentia.Despite their history with their own state, a clear majority has sky-high social safety net expectations. The Soviet Union \"provided\" for most things you would presume to need to work for. The quality of what was \"provided\" and the price of it in liberties is a whole different conversation. Still, a lot of the older population is essentially shell-shocked into a \"give us what we need and do whatever the hell you want\" mentality. The naturally rosy view of the past doesn't help. This isn't likely to change much while the people carrying the view are still alive.Russians are amazing at edge cases and weird problems. Building a repeatable, functioning product of any quality is generally incompatible with what's described above, but edge one-offs have always been a stand-out. Ilyushin Il-76 is the world's most used cargo aircraft not because it's so good, but because it's so bad. It's fully serviceable with a monkey wrench and can land on a swamp. Having to work around lack of infrastructure has at times resulted in awe-inspiring fits of ingenuity. A lot of us find pride in the such fits of the past; some also lament it being gone. Greatness lost.Russians are fascinated with, and fascinatingly similar to, the major Latino cultures. The first TV series to go huge after the lifting of the ban on most foreign-made media was Escrava Isaura (1976 TV series). The national idea of a male sex symbol sums up to Antonio Banderas. Ricky Martin was da bomb; his coming out was a mournful moment (only partially jesting). Russians who traveled the Spanish/Portuguese-speaking parts have noted a host of other similarities as well. As an amusing side-note, Portuguese phonetics are close enough to Russian that Russian speakers tend to speak Portuguese with no noticeable accent. Did I mention Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora was huge in Russia? :)Russians are as insular as the Americans. The level of knowledge of cultures outside of one's country is equally low, but also coupled with wide-spread, frequently hilariously baseless certainty of one's knowledge. The things typical middle-class Russians \"know\" about America would leave a typical middle-class American slack-jawed in awe. Not quite \"bears playing balalaikas in the Red Square\"-stupid, but still pretty silly.The Russian cursing (\u043c\u0430\u0442) is a sufficient language unto itself. Deservedly a subject of national pride, one can express oneself virtually entirely in cuss, and be perfectly well understood.But what amazes me most is, The Russians are still here. The 20th century hasn't been kind to us - we split the country down every seam, tore it inside out, drove most of the higher-functioning elite out in the 1920's, destroyed the majority of the rest in the 1930's, turned a significant chunk of the population into cannon fodder in the 1940's, bred creeping fear into our bones over the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's, destroyed the economy and what was left of most people's livelyhoods in the 1990's, but here we are - the fragile, hapless middle-class already protesting over civil liberties. Familiar sight West of us - but still somewhat of a new day in Moscow, trust me."

And what has worsened the problem is the animals\u2019 excellent memory.There\u2019s a reason we say that an elephant never forgets: due to their long-lasting memory, elephants can remember for years specific people who provoked them or caused them great harm, and can even suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition long thought to be solely human \u2013 indeed, when traumatized or threatened, these normally gentle giants can quickly become aggressive, to the extent of associating us with mortal danger or considering us as a far more formidable predator than any lion or tiger.In some severe cases, the damage is too much to handle, and the harm too much to be forgotten \u2013 for instance: what can be more traumatizing and harmful for an elephant than to see a beloved family member, or worse its own mother, getting killed right before its eyes? \u2013, that most individuals will resort to ruthlessly attack humans whenever possible.On a lighter note, elephants can exhibit a friendlier behavior towards humanity, especially when many individuals show ever-lasting gratitude to the very people who saved their lives and/or provided them all the care (medical, nutritional, psychological and the like) they required, at a point of developing a friendly bond with these humans.In fact, many other elephants have pushed the limits by stepping in to rescue humans in danger, protecting them either from animal attacks \u2013 for that matter, some individuals have even been reported saving people from other elephants! \u2013, from natural disasters like floods[1] or from raging currents (like the individual did in the video below). This actually doesn\u2019t surprise zoologists, for elephants are intelligent enough to experience the same emotions as humans do[2], including empathy (which will make an elephant act so as to save the life of another species, however different).Footnotes[1] Elephants Rescue Hundreds of People From Floods[2] https://www.elephant-world.com/elephants-and-humans/",

They have been trained for thousands of years to do everything from play soccer to destroy the enemy on the battlefield. They were the tanks of the ancient world and the front end loaders and the tractors. Their size and strength are of course, second to none. There are many tales and legends told about elephants, both long ago and today in many different languages and among very different cultures. What is so telling about these stories is that they don't usually go on about their incredible size and strength, because that is obvious. What they all eagerly tell of is the great intelligence, formidable memories and complex nature of these gentle giants. Now, I have to be honest and say that when people ask me how clever a particular animal, such as a lion for example is, I usually say, \"a lion is a genius at being a lion\". What I am trying to say is that every animal has evolved to perfectly fit its niche and may be very dumb at doing what doesn't benefit it, and very clever at doing what does. However, when someone asks me about Elephants, I get very excited and my little story about all animals being geniuses goes out the window. I immediately start comparing them to us. Here is why. Like us, elephants are self-aware. This has been proven scientifically through a number of recent studies. In one study an elephant called Happy would touch a white cross painted on her forehead, a test used to test self-awareness in children. She could only see it in a mirror and understood that she was looking at a reflection of herself:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6100430.stm Elephants practice altruism. There is a now famous story of an Indian elephant called Chandrasekharan, who was working lifting poles off a truck as it moved along, and placing them in holes dug in the ground. When Chandrasekharan came to one hole he refused to put the log in. Eventually the Mahout checked and discovered a dog sleeping in it. Only when the dog was gone would Chandrasekharan put the pole in. This sort of behaviour is typical of elephants. Elephants really do have long memories. Elephants eat an incredible variety of foods and need to cover large distances to get it. They need to know where to go at what time of year. They learn this and remember it. They also have complex communication and societies and so need to remember all the different individuals' voices and smells so as to be socially adept. The old saying, \"an elephant never forgets\" is fairly true. This is also shown in the size and development of their brains which are proportionally 0.08 percent of their body-weight while that of a horse is 0.02 percent of its body weight. This was all figured out by a scientist called Herbert Haug. He also discovered that the brains of elephant and humans are both highly convoluted, which increases the surface area of the brain. I once had a love hate relationship with an elephant at Fothergill Island in Zimbabwe in about 1991. Every day I would drive out the front gate and a bull elephant we called Left Hook (he had extra curve to his left tusk) would charge my vehicle. And every day I would rev my engine and bang the door and tell him to sod off and then we would go our separate ways. Every single day this happened without fail. If other vehicles came and went he would ignore them and then go for mine. One day I went out in a different vehicle, stopped nearby and watched for a while. The wind changed, he caught my scent and of course we went through the whole noisy rigmarole again before I was allowed to leave with my by now, completely traumatized tourists. More recently it has been found that spindle neurons play an important role in the development of intelligent behaviour. Spindle neurons are found in the brains of humans, great apes, dolphins and elephants. There are many other behaviours exhibited by elephants such as grieving (see my answer to What non human animals grieve?), playing, mimicking producing art and using tools, all of which serve to show their flexible and powerful minds.Elephant painting in thailand. However, what I found most amazing is their problem-solving ability. To illustrate this, and because I risk happily waffling on forever, I will leave you with one last story: Working Asian elephants sometimes wear wooden bells. The young elephants will deliberately stuff them with clay so that they can sneak into banana groves without being heard in order to steal as much as possible!A wild bull elephant \"playing\" with legendary Zimbabwean game ranger Willie De Beer.

Obviously the two went straight in to get these treats, and the door was closed and locked behind them Next night, again the new arrivals wouldn\u2019t follow the herd indoors, so again the keepers cut up some oranges But this time, only the female went in. She ate half the oranges, then came out again. Then the male went in again, and ate the rest, then came out Let\u2019s examine this. These animals could predict the future (oranges today, oranges tomorrow), communicate and plan (this is what we\u2019ll do) and trust (I\u2019ll only eat half then leave the rest for you) There is a level of intelligence there that is usually greatly underestimated",

Yet, since antiquity, observers have agreed that the elephant is the animal most akin to man.\u201d That is, elephants show, in at least a primitive form, many of the features of personhood. Perhaps the things that make us humans beings unique are not entirely the same as the things that make us persons. Although there are a few solitary elephants, \u201cloners\u201d or \u201chermits,\u201d most elephants live in one of two kinds of groups, cow herds and bull herds. Here is a photograph of a cow herd.  Cow herds are tightly-knit and permanent groups of related females and their calves, led by the oldest and most dominant female, the matriarch. These are usually between 10 and 50 animals, but they can be as large as 500. Now and then, such as when the matriarch dies, they split into smaller groups.  When a male calf reaches maturity, the cows drive him away, violently if necessary. For a while he tries to return, but they won\u2019t let him. Eventually, he joins up with a bull herd. Bull herds are much looser, temporary groups of mature males. Their association seems to be based not on blood but on friendship, enjoying each other\u2019s company, and on self-interest, since being part of a group provides mutual advantages. The more stable bull herds sort themselves into a hierarchy based on dominance, which is usually based on size, which\u2014since male elephants never stop growing\u2014is in turn based on age. Cow herds and bull herds are aware of each other, but they usually only come together to mate.  These herds are not self-contained; they are part of a larger network of kinship groups in the wider geographical area. Zoologist Joyce Poole writes in Growing Up with Elephants, \u201cElephant society is complex and multi-tiered, involving other families, clans, and subpopulations. Eventually, an adult elephant will know every elephant in its population and will know its relationship and position with regard to each.\u201d Essential to being part of society is being able to communicate with each other. Elephants communicate intensely through a complex \u201clanguage\u201d that involves all of their senses. Visual communication, to begin with, mostly involves the positioning of the head and the trunk. Although the significance of each is not understood, scientists have recognized at least twenty different postures on the scale of aggression to submission. The most aggressive is the intimidation posture, which looks like this: the elephant faces its opponent directly, raises its head, and spreads its ears at right angles to its head, making it look much bigger. Sometimes it will shake its head back and forth, causing its ears to snap sharply against its head, trumpet loudly, toss up dust and bushes, and even bluff a charge. The second kind of communication is oral. Elephants can make at least thirty different vocal sounds, including trumpets, squeals, growls, rumbles, and sounds too low-pitched for humans to hear. Poole classifies these sounds into several types: dominance, sexual excitement, social excitement, group dynamics and coordination, social fear, surprise, and distress. Other experts think there is a sound for reassurance. One sound, the \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d rumble, could be considered symbolic and therefore an instance of language. As in our own species, female elephants are much more chatty than males. They vocalize much more, and nineteen of the sounds are used exclusively by females. Not all communication is \u201cverbal\u201d\u2014much of it is tactile. Elephants touch either frequently, and for many reasons. Sometimes it\u2019s aggressive. Bulls competing for mating privileges, like these ones, will engage in shoving matches, which are forceful but rarely harmful. Sometimes it\u2019s playful. Young elephants bounce off each other, climb on each other, and even \u201ctrunk wrestle.\"  Most often, however, it\u2019s affectionate. When two of them meet after having been separated, they extend touch the tips of their trunks together in something like a handshake. When they are together, they stroke and caress each other with their trunks and forefeet. They find it reassuring. Finally, elephants communicate by smell and even taste. They emit bodily chemicals to mark territory, for example, or to indicate when they are in heat. This may be another reason they put their trunks in each other\u2019s mouths.We\u2019ve seen some elephant affection already; but by far the most affectionate elephant relationship is between a mother and her calf.  Since the bull wanders off soon after mating, the cow gives birth surrounded by her female relatives. This is a cause of great excitement for them: they crowd around the calf, making affectionate noises and trying to touch it and pick it up. Clearly, they find it adorable. If this little guy didn\u2019t weigh 250 pounds, I\u2019d try to pick him up too.  Elephant mothers are exceptionally doting, nearly always cuddling with their children and indulging their every need. There are many stories of mother elephants going to heroic and sacrificial lengths to protect their babies. Yet parenting can be an exhausting job. It takes a village to raise a child\u2014or in this case, it takes a herd. When the mother needs a rest, the juvenile cows in the herd, called \u201callomothers\u201d or \u201caunties\u201d take over. According to Jeheskel Shoshani, in Elephants: Majestic Creatures of the Wild, their job is \u201cfollowing [the calves], standing over them while they are sleeping, getting them up when the family moves on, helping them if they get stuck in the mud or caught up in a bush, running to their aid if they make a distress call, and chasing after them and bringing them back if they wander.\u201d Eltringham writes that \"Many of the skills an elephant needs to survive are not innate but have to be learned from others.\" So the older elephants are educators. They are also disciplinarians: they will spank young elephants with their trunks if they get out of line.  When these young elephants reach maturity at about fourteen years old, the females are taught child care and the males are expelled from the herd. If birth is an emotional time for elephants, so is death. Unlike any other animals except humans, elephants seem to have an awareness of their mortality. Sadly, sometimes birth and death occur together, if a calf is stillborn. When this happens, the herd will wait as the bereaved mother stands off by herself for a day or two, holding her dead child on her tusks. When an adult elephant is dying, either of age or of something else, the others may stand next to him, propping him up. When he finally dies, they stand over his body for a long time, caressing it with their feet or their trunks, sometimes even weeping elephant tears. According to Alexander, they often return the next day to pay their respects, and sometimes they bury the body by covering it with dirt or branches.  And this may be the most uncanny thing of all: when elephants come across skeletons of other animals, they ignore them, but when they come across elephant bones, they react differently. Poole writes, \u201cThey approach slowly and silently, and then the touching begins, slowly, as they deliberately, carefully turn a skull over and over with their trunks, touching, hovering over the long bones with their hind feet.\u201d This is a sobering observation\u2014and, I think, an appropriate place to conclude. I\u2019ve shown that elephants have a complex social organization, a sophisticated system of communication, what appear to be deep bonds between them (especially between mothers and children), and a way of responding to death that is strangely similar to that of our own species. Whether these things make them persons or not, I\u2019ll let you decide."

So now that you set sail to navigate the uncharted territories of my never ending ocean of knowledge  brace yourself for the impact. And forgive me for the inadvertent mistakes committed as I candidly admit that my knowledge of grammar and punctuations is not even rudimentary . The easiest and the best strategy to learn and retain the words you have already learnt is that you associate them with something such as pics or some instances in your life. It could be anything  FIRSTLY Let me illustrate it with an example   How do I keep track of the words that I find difficult ? 1. Megalomaniac - a person who has an obsessive desire for power. I played a game ( Evil Genius ) in which this term was excessively used to refer to the protagonist or more like the antagonist of the game. Whenever I come across this term, the image of that protagonist appears in front of me. That's how I have learned it. 2. Deja Vu- from French, literally \"already seen\" I could still recall the day I discussed the meaning of this word with my elder brother while sitting underneath a tree. Nostalgic I feel  3. Achilles heel - And I could remember the movie 'Troy' In which the protagonist died due to injury on his heel as it was his only mortal part of body. (or rather his only weakness) Same goes with the following words  1. Sinister - meaning -giving the impression that something harmful or evil is happening or will happen.- I watched a movie by this name. 2. Insidious-meaning - proceeding in a gradual, subtle way, but with very harmful effects. Same as above 3. maleficent -meaning -  harmful or evil in intent or effect- Angelina Jolie in the movie.4. Procrastination-   habit of we the Indians or at least our successive governments.  5. Shenanigans, embezzlement- And I start imagining about the previous  Indian government.  While some others are really easy to comprehend such as  Misanthrope - My former English teacher Lackadaisical - My incumbent HSS elective teacher. Nincompoop - My roomie in hostel.( I know he would not read it and if he does then he image would get associated with a few more words in my mind dictionary i.e . Belligerent, Pugnacious  etc.  SECOND  Besides that  Learning the roots of the words is also a good way of permanently etching the words in your mind and in certain cases it may work wonders.   'Geras' means 'God of old age' in Greek mythology.  If you know this then presume you would correctly guess the meaning the meaning of the upcoming words such as Gerontocracy,          Geriatrician  and Gerontologist. Another Marvellous example is Latin word for 'old' is 'senex' the root for  Senile - Showing signs of mental or physical deterioration that is usually marked with old age Senescent -  Ageing, Growing old  Senior - older Senate - originally a council of older and presumable wiser citizens  If you really find it alluring and enticing then  I would sincerely advice you to buy yourself this Bible. Salvation lies within this book boy. It contains the roots of the words. Even the historical references are given. It is the H.C. Verma of vocabulary building.    THIRD  Finally  I recommend that you go through the link I have shared.  It would really aid you to in your efforts to learn new words as well as keep in mind the old ones.  A List 1-10 | Vocab Made Easy What distinguishes it from other such content on the internet is that it would offer you good examples pertaining to the words as well, as a photographs illustrating the examples, so that even if you forget he examples and the meaning of the word altogether then at least you would have the pics (which are hard to forget) as your last lifeline. Here is a demonstration  ABDICATEMeaning - to renounce a throne, to give up, to surrender.Synonyms - relinquish, renounce, reject, cast off, disclaim.Antonyms  - assert, assume, challenge, claim, defend, defy, hold, maintain, remain, retain, treasure, usurp.Usage - Bush abdicated his power.10. ABJECTMeaning - Sunk to a low condition, cast down in spiritSynonyms - beggarly, degraded, wretched, miserable.Antonyms - Exalted, proud.Usage - Children dwelling in abject poverty.FOURTH  And  If you are really serious about it, then I suggest that you keep doing what you are doing at the moment. i.e .Reading.   The more you read or study, the more new words you would come across. This would serve dual purpose of yours as you would be able to incorporate new words in your active dictionary and simultaneously you will be in touch with the ones you have already learned as you would encounter them multiple times while reading and in order to strengthen your belief on my just concluded statement I would like to emphasize on the upcoming one. It is a generally accepted fact that the good writers and speakers are voracious readers. Be it journalists or novelists   Though it is a proven and tested method and would lead to the holistic development of your speaking skills and writing skills but it also entails enormous efforts and time.  And even if you are short on time such as you are supposed to prepare for some sort of exam.Don't try to cram or mug up the words since it is not a good investment of your precious time as the one who crams or mugs the things adds nothing to his already owned knowledge.",
            "In my opinion, the best way to memorize English words is by relating them to people and situations. For instance, the word \u2018stingy\u2019 means miser. There must be such people around you who are stingy. Relate it to them and it would stay with you. Another example: Have a look at the sentence- \u201cHave a good day!\u201d, the doctor drawled. The word \u2018drawl\u2019 means to stretch the vowel sounds.

To exemplify- \u2018gregarious\u2019 is used to refer to people who are so fond of socializing that they cannot even think of being alone. It was originally used for sheep because they always live in herds and never lead a solitary life.Another way is to group synonyms ( words with same or similar meanings) together and commit them to memory. For example- comely, pretty, bonny, gorgeous, ravishing, attractive, beautiful all mean good-looking and as such they are synonyms. Learn them together.Similarly, if you know the meaning of a particular word, it would be easy to learn its antonyms (opposites). Let us talk about \u2018infidel\u2019. You might not be able to guess its meaning, but if I reveal that it is the opposite of \u2018believer\u2019, it will become as easy as ABC to remember it.Apart from this, it is said that most people need at least 6 sightings of a word to be able to remember it and make it a part of their functional vocabulary.

A good dictionary divides the words into syllables and tells you about the history of the word and the meaning of its parts.  This strategy is very important for academic English.  If you know the parts in one word, this helps you guess and remember similar words.  Your vocabulary grows faster and you remember the words better. New words must be used.  If we don't use a word, we forget it quickly.  Choose the words that are most useful for your studies or your job! Academic English words like \"emit\" must be studied.

It is apparent that early, strong action to contain the spread of the virus, along with a culture of civil obedience, are extremely impactful.Public health agencies around the world need to be funded adequately enough to plan in advance for what to do when a pandemic strikes. What we saw instead was that, although some countries responded more decisively than others, no one was truly ready. We saw various leaders drag their feet, deny that there was an issue, minimize the gravity of the situation, and then adopt inadequate measures. All this would have been less likely if there had been more preparation.For instance, how do we determine what the actual fatality rate is? In the beginning of epidemics, fatality rates commonly appear high, because the people most likely to be tested are the most gravely ill. But if we\u2019re going to use data on the fatality or hospitalization rate, we need to know what I will call the serepositive fatality and hospitalization rates. That is, what percentage of all people infected by the virus actually need hospitalization?We also need to have specific metrics for how and when we decide how much physical distancing to impose, and when those restrictions are to be lifted. The earlier we make those decisions, the more rational they are likely to be. But when we wait until after a pandemic as already started, the risks of overreacting or underreacting are much higher. Perhaps there are clear answers. I haven\u2019t seen them. It appears to me that there is much too much winging it for my tastes, at least in the US.People really love conspiracy theories and explanations reinforce pre-existing biases. The idea that viruses mutate all the time and that some mutations are bound to be much more virulent and dangerous than others is deeply unsatisfying. A culprit must be found. It must be that someone was developing this virus for biological warfare. If you\u2019re American, that someone is China. If you\u2019re Chinese, that someone is the US. If you don\u2019t like Chinese people, but overt racism is no longer Kosher, the virus must have spread because Chinese people have unhygienic habits and eat bats. If you\u2019re anti-government, the pandemic\u2014or the response to it\u2014is a hoax to enable the government to encroach on your liberties.The Republican Party in the US is apparently not opposed to passing a stimulus to support the economy, as long as there is a Republican in the White House and an election they stand to otherwise lose. Interesting. Very interesting. Good thing the Democratic Party actually believes in governing rather than using crises as an opportunity to obstruct governance and blame the party in power for any calamity that befalls the nation.Panicked people are very poor decision makers. They are often more interested in finding comfort than in finding accurate information. In such environments, it\u2019s easy for charlatanism and misinformation to spread. A few days ago, I had walked more than 5 miles and I was too tired to walk home. So I took a Lyft. My driver was convinced he had a sure way of avoiding the virus, because he watched some videos on YouTube and was now an expert on virology. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him his theories were nonsensical. I didn\u2019t mention that I was a doctor. I told him I would look it up to end the conversation, and at that point, we were already at my destination, so I left. Maybe I should have argued with him. But I didn\u2019t think I was going to convince him. So I didn\u2019t bother trying.Sometimes an idiot or an inarticulate person makes a pronouncement that is easy to ridicule but nonetheless contains some wisdom. This crisis has shown the limits of internationalism. Had you told me 18 months ago that Donald Trump had said that we needed to make sure we were manufacturing drugs and hospital supplies at home rather than in China, I would have rolled my eyes. It would have been impossible for him to present the argument cogently or without some racist or nationalistic attack against China. He would have sounded like he had just heard something from some commentator on Fox News, which he was just regurgitating in his 4th-grade-level vocabulary, without being able to explain the intellectual underpinnings of the argument. And yet, the argument would have been sound at its root. The underlying assumption of internationalism is that we are all stronger when we cooperate. Faced with a pandemic, governments were in theory supposed to coordinate their responses, and to be as concerned with sick people outside their borders as they were with the health of their own denizens, if for nothing else because of enlightened self-interest. But in practice, it was everyone for themself. Borders were closed more to keep others out than because anyone was concerned about global public health. Countries found themselves competing for masks and ventilators. Many Western nations realized just how vulnerable their supply chains were. No one wants a war with China, a powerful nuclear-armed nation with an economy that will soon surpass that of the US. But it\u2019s not inconceivable that at some point in the next few decades, there could at least be a full scale trade war. A lot of countries are realizing that there is a strategic benefit to being able to fully control your own access to certain goods, even at the cost of higher prices. I expect more countries to move to reassert control over the access of such strategic goods as pharmaceuticals and medical equipment in the years to come.",

The only variety of stupidity we haven\u2019t replicated from the Black Death as yet is the Flagellants and I bet we\u2019ll have them back by the end of the year. The number of questions on Quora about viruses and bacteria is enormous, most betraying some fundmental confusion between the two, and likewise about how to treat them and so on. I would have thought this was quite basic medical knowledge that everyone should know, as viral and bacterial diseases of many milder kinds are not uncommon, and we need to know how to self treat and appreciate what our GPs can and cannot do for us. More worrying are the many questions about quacky remedies and this is where we start drifting into the medieval. Seriously people, diet is not going to work, garlic and lemon may reduce some cold symptoms very slightly, not cure anything. Zinc likewise nothing, Vitamin C no, injections of it as part of a hospital treatments are one thing, scoffing pills at home are a waste of time for most. Then theres crap like the Copper Zap, a device of such mindboggling stupidity I thought it was a joke. There are always people falling for this kind of thing but the fear of Covid-19 has made peoples level of immunity to bullshit even lower and the quacks are taking advantage. Then there are the \u2018Is the virus natures way of controlling over population? Is this the planets revenge for us eating meat/pollution/global warming?\u2019 type of question. This is seriously medieval thinking. Back in the days of the Black Death it was of course God sending the plague to punish us for our sins, but these days some nebuolous but apparently sentient force like \u2018nature\u2019 or \u2018the planet\u2019 is invoked, even sometimes by people who would not otherwise regard themselves as religious. And for the good old fashioned sins and graces of the Catholic Church substitute whatever behaviour the questioner does or doesn\u2019t like, be that veganism, fracking, having a socialised health system whatever. The terms have changed but the mode of arguing and the smugness radiated are exactly the same as the worst religious dingbattery. Essentially they are arguing \u2018do as I say or my teleological delusion will make you die of a horrible disease\u2019 in the absence of anything more reasonable and evidenced. And back during the Black Death we had people who partied like it was the end of the world and gave not a fig what the priests thought. These days we have idiots who go and crowd the beach or have barbecues becuase they are too selfish and ignorant to listen to what we know about viral spread. The number of people whinging becuase they are suffering some personal inconvenience is shocking, as are those insisting still, thousands of casualities in and rising, that it is all exaggerated and they fear for \u2018the economy\u2019 (ie their own money and their own freedom to be an arse and infect others). Blaming outsiders is popular too. Back in the middle ages in Europe it was the Jews allegedly poisoning the wells, or where there were no Jews they blamed the lepers. These days we have nationalist morons saying it was a bioweapon unleashed by China/US/whoever you don\u2019t like, racist morons claiming the Chinese are \u2018genetically more susceptible\u2019 or some such shit and just plain moronic morons chucking bricks through the windows of Chinese businesses, or even Vietnamese or Korean ones because they are just fucking morons. So over all the 21st century has cycled back to the 14th, history is repeating itself left, right and centre and the Enlightenment was a sham that created a surface veneer of reason and civilisation that actually takes very little to stress and fracture.",

All they represent is that the weather is highly variable. The best way I can tell you about this is that I have seen \u201cOpen Winters\u201d literally ones without snow, ice or even frosts and other winters which froze your buns off. Where I live the normal temperature variations are from about 120F to about -25F. (49C to -32C). Considering the variations which are normal if I saw a day at -26F or 121F it would not be climate change it would just a new level of variation within the normal. NOAA and other weather authorities are doing very subtle Eco-Terrorism with maps and graphs of \u201ctemperature anomaly\u201d stuff. The game is to obscure the information from you that tells you the truth. I am not suggesting that we should not be using a \u201ctemperature anomaly\u201d map. It does tell us what is going on at this time. For example a Pacific Ocean Temperature Anomaly Map is how the ENSO and other analysis for Annual weather variations such as El Nino/La Nina information and it\u2019s effects on weather patterns. These informational changes are important. If you will remember in 2022 there was much talk about drought lasting forever in the Southwest USA. I spoke up in September based on the ENSO data that in mid December the Drought in California would break. I knew the DATE, December 18, 2022, but I carefully only said about the 3rd week! It was based off ENSO and temperature anomaly maps. NOAA had published that date! It did end too! Now let\u2019s be clear I do not oppose the use of such data for rational discussion but NOAA etc. are using such to terrorize the public who doesn\u2019t seem to understand what is going on This is why I accuse them of Eco-Terrorism. It is because these people at NOAA are NOT telling people the truth of what they should be doing with the data and what it really means. Telling you it means Global Warming because it is El Nino winter 2023/2024 is nuts. This cycle was well known by the early 1900\u2019s. It was referred to in WW2 films about the area near the Aleutian Islands as \u201cWhere Weather Is Born\u201d . It was solidly known by 1940\u2019s based on nearly a century of observation data that if you observed the weather near Greenland and near the Aleutian Islands you could know the weather of the Northern Hemisphere. That is why the NAZI\u2019s put up weather stations on Spitzbergen and on Greenland. The criticality of this weather data was what timed the \u201cBattle of the Bulge\u201d and much more in WW2. There was much war over north Atlantic weather ships and this accounts for much of the attention to the Aleutian\u2019s by Japan and the USA in WW2. Treating this stuff as some \u201cnew discovery\u201d and using it to scare people is just evil. People should actually be made aware of the reality of how long we have known about this weather phenomena and what it actually tells us. I know people wonder how I know, it was stuff I leaned as a kid. My parents told me about it and I studied the science. For those who don\u2019t understand my Father was one of the men who put man on the moon. I was never going to get the ability to be dumb in such matters. The attempt to project some \u201cGlobal Warming\u201d nonsense out of the temperature anomaly maps is just evil. Like I said it is Eco-Terrorism. The reason you are seeing it as new isn\u2019t that it is some new discovery. It is we finally got the ability to provide you pretty colored maps and the NOAA and others have found you are scared of RED! So they color maps like this.You looking at this map rely on the fact that Red is a \u201cBad Temperature\u201d This is well dated and is obviously the NOAA Gulf of Mexico Sea Surface Temperature map. They took their computer software and made the highest Red and Yellow with the coldest Blue and Purple. This is a \u201crubber ruler trick\u201d The fact is you are relying on NOAA to give you temperatures based upon Red is a hot temperature and the other end is cold. You are used to seeing this as a temperature scale and if you read the scale which I do, I know that this scale is a second derivative (change) scale. It isn\u2019t a temperature map. So I made some software so I could simply move it back to temperature scale. The trick here is that they move the scale around fooling you into thinking it is a absolute value temperature scale. They post a temperature number but the colors are first derivative (change). Here is what the map looks like when you stop seeing the derivative and see the absolute temperature. I scaled it for what you want to know, hurricane risk. Hurricanes don\u2019t happen much below about 33 C so I locked that to Red. The Tropical Storms and Tropical Depressions can happen down to about 31.5 C so Yellow is that range. Green and below is just fine for no hurricanes.Now if you see this map you can go home if you live on the Gulf of Mexico and even into the Caribbean and know that the Hurricane Risk and TS risk is essentially zero. The season is essentially over! This is an ABSOLUTE temperature range. I could use it year in and year out to give me the data I need for knowing what is going on. It is a \u201csafe\u201d indicator. The NOAA maps are just Eco-Terrorism and they are using their mapping tricks to really play with your head. Compare the top map of the Gulf of Mexico as NOAA presents it on their website with this map they present on the same site.Here you see the same RED problem. You see that Red in this map is over 10 C colder than the coldest scale on the original NOAA map. You would think Washington State and Vancouver Island were going to get a Hurricane from the colors. Believe me before you put on your Bikini and dive into the water here that RED is going to freeze your buns off. That RED is so cold you wouldn\u2019t survive 30 minutes in it without a wetsuit. The coldest blues in the Gulf of Mexico map you could and would enjoy swimming for hours and hours. That\u2019s how screw...",

In the context of global warming, it is used to describe the difference between the average global temperature and a reference temperature. The reference temperature is usually the average temperature of a specific period, such as 1951-1980.Air temperatures on Earth have been rising since the Industrial Revolution. While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer. According to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade. The maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)Temperature anomalies are used to track changes in global temperatures over time. According to NASA, Earth\u2019s global average surface temperature in 2020 statistically tied with 2016 as the hottest year on record, continuing a long-term warming trend due to human activities. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880. The image below shows global temperature anomalies in 2022, which tied for the fifth warmest year on record. The past nine years have been the warmest years since modern recordkeeping began in 1880.As the maps show, global warming does not mean temperatures rise everywhere at every time by same rate. Temperatures might rise 5 degrees in one region and drop 2 degrees in another. For instance, exceptionally cold winters in one place might be balanced by extremely warm winters in another part of the world. Generally, warming is greater over land than over the oceans because water is slower to absorb and release heat (thermal inertia). Warming may also differ substantially within specific land masses and ocean basins. In the animation at the top of the page and in the bar chart below, the years from 1880 to 1939 tend to be cooler, then level off by the 1950s. Decades within the base period (1951-1980) do not appear particularly warm or cold because they are the standard against which other years are measured. The leveling off of temperatures in the middle of the 20th century can be explained by natural variability and by the cooling effects of aerosols generated by factories, power plants, and motor vehicles in the years of rapid economic growth after World War II. Fossil fuel use also increased after the war (5 percent per year), boosting greenhouse gases. Cooling from aerosol pollution happened rapidly. In contrast, greenhouse gases accumulated slowly, but they remain in the atmosphere for a much longer time. According to former GISS director James Hansen, the strong warming trend of the past four decades likely reflects a shift from balanced aerosol and greenhouse gas effects on the atmosphere to a predominance of greenhouse gas effects after aerosols were curbed by pollution controls.Why should we care about one or two degrees of global warming? After all, temperatures fluctuate by many degrees every day where we live. The temperatures we experience locally and in short periods can fluctuate significantly due to predictable, cyclical events (night and day, summer and winter) and hard-to-predict wind and precipitation patterns. But the global temperature mainly depends on how much energy the planet receives from the Sun and how much it radiates back into space. The energy coming from the Sun fluctuates very little by year, while the amount of energy radiated by Earth is closely tied to the chemical composition of the atmosphere\u2014particularly the amount of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all of the oceans, the atmosphere, and the land masses by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age. A five-degree drop was enough to bury a large part of North America under a towering mass of ice 20,000 years ago.Global temperature records start around 1880 because observations did not sufficiently cover enough of the planet prior to that time. The line plot above shows yearly temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2020 as recorded by NASA, NOAA, the Berkeley Earth research group, the Met Office Hadley Centre (United Kingdom), and the Cowtan and Way analysis. Though there are minor variations from year to year, all five records show peaks and valleys in sync with each other. All show rapid warming in the past few decades, and all show the last decade as the warmest. The NASA GISS team chose the period of 1951-1980 as its baseline largely because the U.S. National Weather Service uses a three-decade period to define \u201cnormal\u201d or average temperature. The GISS temperature analysis effort also began around 1980, so the most recent 30 years was 1951-1980. Their objective is to provide an estimate of temperature change that could be compared with predictions of global climate change in response to atmospheric carbon dioxide, aerosols, and changes in solar activity. NASA\u2019s temperature analyses incorporate surface temperature measurements from more than 20,000 weather stations, ship- and buoy-based observations of sea surface temperatures, and temperature measurements from Antarctic research stations. These in situ measurements are analyzed using an algorithm that considers the varied spacing of temperature stations around the globe and urban heat island effects. Global surface temperature anomalies are a description of how the overall average temperature of the surface of the Earth deviates from what is expected. The value is obtained by measuring the average water temperature of the first few meters below the surface of the ocean and the temperature between the land surface and 1.5 meters above. This measurement is then compared to what is expected based on past measurements. This measurement is closely linked to land surface air temperature, which looks only at temperatures above land. Anomalies are measured by the number of degrees that the temperature varies from the average. A positive anomaly means temperatures were warmer than a reference value, while negative anomalies are cooler than that reference value. The world has been showing a frightening abundance of positive anomalies in the past decade, which means the world is getting warmer. Figure 1 shows a map of temperature anomalies around the world in 2017.A temperature anomaly, in the context of climate science and global warming, provides valuable information about how Earth's temperatures are changing over time. Specifically, a temperature anomaly is the deviation from a long-term average temperature for a specific location or the entire planet. It is typically expressed in degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit. Here's what a temperature anomaly tells us about global warming:Trends in Temperature: Temperature anomalies help identify trends in temperature changes. When positive anomalies (warmer than average) consistently outweigh negative anomalies (colder than average), it indicates that temperatures are increasing over time, which is a key indicator of global warming.Confirmation of Climate Models: Climate models predict that rising greenhouse gas concentrations, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) from human activities, will lead to a warming of the Earth's surface. Temperature anomalies observed over time provide empirical evidence that supports the predictions made by these models.Spatial Variation: Temperature anomalies are not uniform across the globe. They reveal regional variations in temperature changes, which can be important for understanding the localized impacts of global warming. Some regions may experience more significant warming than others.Seasonal Variability: Temperature anomalies can also show seasonal patterns. For example, they can reveal whether a particular year or season was exceptionally warm or cold compared to the long-term average, helping scientists understand the seasonal dynamics of climate change.Historical Perspective: By comparing current temperature anomalies with historical records, researchers can assess how temperatures have changed over decades or centuries. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding the long-term trends associated with global warming.Attribution of Warming: Temperature anomalies contribute to the attribution of observed warming to specific factors. Scientists can use data on temperature anomalies to attribute a portion of warming to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.Impacts on Ecosystems and Society: Rising temperatures associated with global warming can have a wide range of impacts on ecosystems, weather patterns, sea levels, and human societies. Temperature anomalies provide information about the extent and rate of these impacts, helping policymakers and researchers plan for adaptation and mitigation strategies.That temperature anomalies are just one piece of the puzzle in understanding global warming. Climate scientists use a combination of temperature data, sea level measurements, ice melt observations, and other climate indicators to build a comprehensive understanding of how the Earth's climate is changing and the role of human activities in driving these changes. Temperature anomalies, however, are a critical and easily understandable metric for tracking and communicating the effects of global warming to the public and policymakers.",

Explanation The temperature anomaly is a temperature statistic for some location and time with an historical temperature record. The statistic is the temperature deviation at some later time relative to some earlier time. The earlier time in the temperature record is considered to be \u201cnormal\u201d. Contrary to claims made elsewhere, it\u2019s not the change relative the average temperature of a location. It\u2019s the change relative to a fixed point in time. Generally the earlier time is actually some earlier time range that is fixed by convention. This is the base time range. All temperature anomalies in a data set will share the same base time to ensure comparability. The temperature anomaly is used instead of actual temperature because it allows the change at different locations to be compared. In this way desert locations can be compared with forest locations, coastal with continental, mountains with valleys, high latitudes with low latitudes. Across a continent the temperature anomalies are very similar regardless of location. This is useful for two reasons.The geographic average of the temperature anomaly is a well defined value. There is not much spread.Real data sets have missing data. In practice missing weather stations don\u2019t change the geographic average of the temperature anomaly much at all.The geographic average of the temperature anomaly tells us that the Earth overall is warming. Scientifically that means that a large amount of energy is being absorbed by the oceans and that there is an imbalance in the Earth\u2019s energy budget. That is not so important to people. What is important is that regional climates are changing, as surface temperature affects everything. That includes ecologies, economies, societies and civilizations. Some places will become hell on Earth.The 'harshest heat wave' in its history caught Southeast Asia off guard | CNNHong Kong CNN \u2014 Every day, countless mopeds criss-cross the congested city of Hanoi, in Vietnam, with commuters traveling to work or motorbike taxis dropping off everything from parcels to cooked food and clients. One of them is Phong, 42, who starts his shift at 5 a.m. to beat the rush hour, navigating the dense swarm of mopeds and drives for over 12 hours a day with little rest. But an unprecedented heat wave that engulfed his country in the past two months has made Phong\u2019s job even more arduous. To get through the heat of the day, he equipped himself with a hat, wet handkerchiefs and several bottles of water \u2013 precautions that provided little relief as recorded daytime temperatures soared to more than 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The average May temperature in Hanoi is 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit). \u201cIf I get a heatstroke, I would be forced to suspend driving to recover,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut I cannot afford it.\u201d Phong, who declined to give his surname, said he carries a tiny umbrella to protect his phone, the main tool he uses for work as a driver for the ride-hailing platform Grab, along with his bike. If the phone breaks, he misses out on much-needed income. \u201cI was worried that the battery would overheat once exposed to the sun,\u201d he said. Nearby in the same city, sanitation worker Dinh Van Hung, 53, toils all day cleaning garbage from the bustling streets of Hanoi\u2019s central Dong Da district. \u201cIt is impossible to avoid the heat, especially at noon and early afternoon,\u201d Dinh told CNN. \u201cExtreme temperatures also make the garbage smell more unpleasant, the hard work is now even more difficult, directly affecting my health and labor.\u201d Dinh says \u201cthere is no other way\u201d but to change when he starts and finishes his shift. Nhac Nguyen/AFP/Getty Images This photo taken on May 22, 2023, shows a man transporting containers of water on his motorbike in Hanoi, Vietnam. \u201cI try to work early in the morning or afternoon and evening,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring lunch break when the temperature is too high, I find a sidewalk in a small alley, spread out the cardboard sheets to rest for a while and then resume work in the afternoon.\u201d Phong and Dinh are among millions of drivers, street vendors, cleaners, builders, farmers, and other outdoor or informal economy workers across Southeast Asia who were hit the hardest during what experts called the region\u2019s \u201charshest heat wave on record.\u201d Workers like them make up the backbone of many societies but are disproportionately affected by extreme weather events, with dangerously high temperatures greatly impacting their health and the already precarious nature of their professions. April and May are typically the hottest months of the year in Southeast Asia, as temperatures rise before monsoon rains bring some relief. But this year, they reached levels never experienced before in most countries of the region, including tourism hotspots Thailand and Vietnam. Thailand saw its hottest day in history at 45.https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/06/06/asia/southeast-asia-heat-wave-humidity-climate-intl-hnk-dst-scn-dg/index.htmlConclusion The temperature anomaly tells a story of change.

It\u2019s almost always on time. But bullet trains only make up a small fraction of trains in Japan. Tickets are expensive and they\u2019re often very long distance, so incentives to be on time are greater. The rest of the train system in Japan, particularly in Tokyo, has a serious congestion problem. In fact, Japanese trains are late all the time\u2026The government finally started tracking these numbers and found that trains in Tokyo on the Chuo-Sobu Line were late an average of 19.1 days a month in 2017 \u2014 so most days. Half of these trains were late under ten minutes and the other half 10 minutes \u2013 30 minutes or more. Delays were often due to suicides (they have to clean up the body\u2026) 2. \u201cJapan has a low crime rate\u201dJapan has practically zero gun homicides and very low homicide rates in general. Sure there\u2019s the deranged lunatic serial killer that lures young girls via Twitter, but it\u2019s pretty rare. But ask any Japanese women if she\u2019s been molested on a train. I dare you. I am willing to bet you that more than half of them will say yes. And the ones that haven\u2019t will tell you about their friends who were. The #Metoo movement has been slow to pick up in Japan and tosatsu along with the train-perverts (chikan) remain big issues. Many of these sexual crimes go unreported. In other words, Japan is safe \u2014 but it\u2019s a lot safer for men than it is for women. 3. \u201cJapanese people are depressed\u201dComing of age day (\u6210\u4eba\u306e\u65e5\uff09Yes, the suicide rate is high \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t mean that the average Japanese person isn\u2019t happy. It just means that on the extremes, for various reasons, we see more suicides. In a 2016 study researchers found a small statistical significance between a certain gene polymorphism common to Japanese people that correlated high stress work environments and the fear of losing jobs with greater risk of depression. A small correlation. But feeling trapped, a crappy boss and a host of societal pressures are enough to send anyone into at least a mild state of depression. It\u2019s not unique to Japanese people. It\u2019s just that maybe there are more crappy jobs in Japan. 4. \u201cJapanese food is great\u201dI do love me some unagi, maki negitoro, corn pizza, melon pan and hello kitty tonkatsu. Also the restaurant Ryo in Odawara is amazing (I recommend dinner over lunch). But a look at the top Michelin star restaurants in Japan for 2018 reveals that they are\u2026mostly not serving Japanese food. More than half of them are French and Italian and Chinese cuisine. In other words, some of the best food in Japan is not Japanese! It ain\u2019t all about the fish eggs and pork ramen my friends. One of the best burgers I\u2019ve had was in Ebisu @ Gotham Grill. 5. \u201cJapan is clean\u201dPeople are taught to recycle from a young age. In fact, you have to recycle your trash\u2026it\u2019s mandatory or else your landlord will disown you. Public trashcans were removed from cities after the sarin attacks in Tokyo in the 90\u2019s as a safety precaution, and people have learned to take their trash home with them. Sure, the streets are clean, but is all of this recycling doing any good? Of course it is, but that doesn\u2019t mean there still isn\u2019t an incredible amount of waste. Environmental awareness is pretty low. Japanese people waste 6.2 million TONS of perfectly edible food each year \u2014 and that\u2019s a conservative estimate. That\u2019s enough food to feed everyone in Haiti and Honduras for an entire year. Japan\u2019s standards for freshness are some of the highest in the world, so produce is often thrown away after one day on the shelves. Prime Minister Abe also declined to sign an agreement to reduce plastic waste in oceans. They\u2019re the only G7 country, apart from the US, that refused to do so (surprise, surprise). Things aren\u2019t getting any better. 6. \u201cJapanese hospitality is great.\u201d You can\u2019t get into 50% of the hot springs (onsen) in Japan if you have a tattoo. You can\u2019t get into many others if you\u2019re a foreigner\u2026You can\u2019t modify a food or drink order at a restaurants. The menu is set\u2026ALWAYS\u2026 It\u2019s impossible. Muri. They won\u2019t let you warm up a cold salad if it\u2019s supposed to be served cold. \u201cFood safety hazard.\u201d Check in times, check out times and meal times follow a rigid schedules at ryokan. I\u2019m not saying there isn\u2019t merit to this approach. But in the West customer service would be defined as \u201cflexibility to have what the customer wants.\u201d In Japan it\u2019s \u201cwe decide what customer service means and push that idea onto customers with zero room for flexibility.\u201d 7. \u201cJapanese students study hard\u201dJapanese college entrance exams are notoriously difficult. There are \u201cjukus\u201d (cram schools) that prep high school students on university entrance exams. But once you get into college, it\u2019s a breeze. No \u2014 it\u2019s a joke. It\u2019s well known among Japanese people that university is your time to have fun. It\u2019s easy to skip most of your classes and graduate. Lots of companies actually recruit university students their first or second years of university! They pick students at \u201ctop universities\u201d knowing very well that they\u2019re going to graduate anyways (since college is for fun), so they race to hand out offer letters, regardless of the students academic results for most of their university years (this is exacerbated by the current labor shortage). 8. \u201cJapanese people are tech savvy\u201d It depends on what you mean by tech savvy. This is Tsutaya.It\u2019s the Japanese equivalent of Blockbuster where you can rent and buy DVDs and CD\u2019s. Surprisingly, it\u2019s still extremely popular in Japan, and there are over one THOUSAND locations around the country. Netflix and streaming services penetration is low. In Japan, cash is king. Thousands of restaurants and shops across the country don\u2019t accept credit cards, so you better bring your yen. And here\u2019s one more: Go to any large electronics store like Bic Camera and you\u2019ll find glistening TVs and VR sets\u2026alongside brand new models of Fax Machines and Calculators! In fact, most companies in Japan still use fax machines. The industry is prime for disruption\u2026Granted, this is all changing (the number of Tsutaya\u2019s are slowly decreasing etc), but Japan is a far cry from the technological utopia that many people imagine. 9. \u201cJapan is dangerous\u201dEarthquakes, tsunamis, radiation, Godzilla\u2026Japan has had 3 big earthquakes in the past 100 years. There also frequent small earthquakes. I was in a movie the other day and felt a small tremor. Nobody looked surprised and we went back to watching the movie. We\u2019re all so used to it. But anyone that decides not to come to Japan because of earthquakes or natural disasters should rethink the basis of these fears. That said, infrastructure, earthquake-proof buildings and evacuation procedures have improved drastically over the past two decades. Buildings sway, they don\u2019t fall.Remember, Japan is a developed country. During the triple disaster earthquake/tsunami/nuclear meltdown in 3/11, roughly 18,000 people died and 2,000 are still missing. It was tragic, but considering the magnitude and aftermath of events, the death tolls were lower than what they would have been if it had occurred in a developing country like Indonesia or Sri Lanka\u2026or Haiti where 200,000 people died in a similar size quake. Keep in mind that Fukushima was one of the largest earthquakes in the past 100 years, in the entire world. One person died from radiation. In the same year, 30,000 people died from firearm deaths in the US (compared to 1,000 total homicides in Japan\u2026) And 37,000 people died from car accidents in the US\u2026compared to 4,000 in Japan. Even accounting for population differences, these statistics in Japan are low (or the US are just high). My point is that you can compare any number you want and chose what to fear. Japan has its natural disasters. But big ones are rare, the entire country is a lot safer in almost every other way, and people are prepared for natural disasters. 10. \u201cJapan is expensive\u201dAll you can drink menus are found in most restaurants and give you a huge bang for your buck.Compared to other mega cities, Japanese real estate prices are lower than London, Paris, New York, LA and San Fran. From a tourists perspective, Japan has an image of being far and exotic, which probably adds to this image. Another reason is, well, because it can be more expensive, if you don\u2019t speak Japanese. A Mckinsey report found that most Western tourists didn\u2019t see Japan as \u201caffordable,\u201d and also uncovered an interesting finding: The average price of Japanese hotels on global booking sites Booking . com or Expedia were 37 percent higher than those available on a Japanese booking site Jalan. So, there\u2019s some arbitrage going on there and prices can be higher. One solution: get a Japanese tour guide or friend to help you book (make a Japanese friend!) Hopefully, as awareness increases and more options open up for foreigners, perceptions of Japan will change. Another one. The flights to Japan are cheap as the government is trying to attract tourists and subsidize many flights, especially through Nagoya \u2014 $760 round trip from San Francisco. Obviously if you go through a travel agency things might be a bit pricey. But when you actually get here, make a Japanese friend or two, things can pretty affordable, both as a tourist and as a resident!Follow me on Quora to get more insights about Japan!",
