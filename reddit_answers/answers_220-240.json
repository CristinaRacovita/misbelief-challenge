neck length pair nearly identical size we found minimum 26 distinguishable synaptic strength corresponding storing 47 bit information synapse because stochastic variability synaptic activation observed precision requires averaging activity several minute easy answer we dont know certain depends lot factor type information longwinded ramble mostly stay ontopic basically depends define information in broadest sense information data system used predict state system if i know i dropped ball 10 meter earth i two piece information  height earths acceleration  thus predict ball hit ground second if i say i drop ball there le information since longer reliably predict hit ground to get bit grounded cell contains million bit nucleus alone thanks dna ordered cellular system  eg cytoskeleton protein electrochemical gradient etc  also said contain information eg protein coded rna coded dna but i think youre driving systemic information content brain ie ordered system computational capacity case appropriate treat neuron indivisible unit fundamental building block brain computer a single neuron thousand synapsis dendritic receive synaptic signal axonal send synaptic signal however neuron typically nothing system either firing firing analogous bit information either 0 1 knowing could conjecture neuron one bit account time in word neuron fire dozen time per second time may fire several second this important rapid firing different effect slow firing eg sending neuron excitatory sending rapid action potential another neuron make neuron likely fire action potential however sending excitatory neuron fire handful time per second ie relatively slow receiving neuron wont receive enough stimulation fire action potential so speed action potential also carry information then get different type synapsis broadly categorize neurontoneuron synapsis excitatory inhibitory excitatory make receiving neuron likely fire inhibitory make le likely fire to recap far consider number neuron number synapsis neuron rate firing action potential synapsis type synapse but wait there weve talked pair neuron neuron receive andor project synapsis dozen even hundred thousand neuron lets consider typical pyramidal neuron found cortex for simplicity well say receives 10 action potential short period time 3 inhibitory interneurons 7 excitatory neuron excitatory action potential make easier neuron fire since received excitatory action potential likely fire in word computation going inside neuron biochemistry reacts incoming action potential computation determines excitatory input exceeds action potential threshold whether inhibitory input strong enough negate so consider ratio synaptic input firing rate then factor kind variable size neuron resting membrane potential type synaptic receptor whether sends excitatory inhibitory neurotransmitter all computation decide whether neuron 0 1 the last thing ill put forward brain exceptionally good

for example visual system receives ton information every second highresolution retina signal conveyed visual cortex broken base component eg house would decomposed straight line angle lightdark area etc integrated complex object eg square integrated context knowledge eg large square place likely house finally awareness eg i see house instead think computation logic consciously visual integration cortex handle hood give u ie conscious self final output remarkably somehow store far 50 bit we dont know memory stored know certain neuronal firing pattern associated different information for example neuronal circuit often firing specific frequency change based thought behavior environment brain eg brain default 40hz 40 time per second frequency firing zone stare space alpha rhythm 10hz appear close eye etc these may byproduct computation may computation oversimplify 20hz frequency certain circuit may encode dog 30hz may encode cat possibly activating neuronal circuit sensitive individual frequency theres much i could talk i move let put together neurons either fire fire intrinsically encodes information the rate fire also encodes information well type neuron number synapsis number currently active synapsis signal polarity ie inhibitory excitatory many factor computationally neuron generally try streamline information reduce processing burden depending brain circuit
