To protect your Mac from viruses, it\u2019s recommended to have antivirus software installed. It can detect and remove malware from your Mac and prevent future infections. CleanMyMac X is an excellent option. I\u2019ve been working with CleanMyMac since its beginnings, and the team has developed several features for cleaning and optimizing Mac\u2019s system, including an antimalware module. The CleanMyMac Malware Removal module provides real-time protection against various types of malware, including adware, spyware, and viruses. It also includes a regularly updated malware database to ensure that it can detect and remove the latest threats. With real-time monitoring and background scanning, the application keeps your system protected without requiring any effort on your part.",

Flashback was a trojan than pretended to be an Adobe Flash update, and used a vulnerability in Java to install itself. 2) Keep system software up to date. Most updates close some vulnerabilities. Apple was too slow in closing the Java vulnerability that allowed Flashback. 3) The newest versions of Mac OS X have much better security features for dealing with malware including trojans.  These include an aggressive sandboxing strategy, signed software and address space randomisation.   If an exploit if found in this environment the sandbox prevents (for example) a buffer over-run in the renderer from gaining access to the file system.  Mountain Lion includes a default setting which will not execute software that is from an untrusted source. Unsigned malware will not run even if you try to run it. These features match the security features of Windows 7 and in some ways exceed them.  Out of the box, a Mountain Lion Mac should be very secure indeed. 4) Treat Flash and Java with some suspicion. They are not installed by default.The biggest malware attacks on the Mac have come through vulnerabilities in these 3rd party systems.  Apple is handing back the distribution of the Java system to Oracle. So future updates should be more timely.  It's becoming possible to live without Flash.  5) Don't bother with Anti Virus software. Just don't. None of the recent malware incidents would have been prevented with AV software.  In every case I can think of , the AV software results in a worse user experience.   Most Mac AV software simply scans files for PC viruses.  This is pointless and can slow your machine.   With one exception - If you work alongside Windows users, you might want to make sure you are not mailing them Office documents or Emails which include PC malware. This is a reasonable courtesy.",

MALWARE POTENTIALLY UNWANTED SOFTWARE (PUPS) VIRUS How to Get Rid of Malware on a Mac There are a few steps to take to clean up your system and remove unwanted malware for good. KILL RUNNING PROCESSESOpen the Activity Monitor.Look for unfamiliar applications.If you're not sure what you're looking for, consult Malwarebytes' list of current viruses and malware for the Mac, or check out a list of older bugs.If you find malware listed in the Activity Monitor, select the application and then select the Quit Process icon on the left side of the top menu (it looks like a stop sign with an X).When asked if you're sure you want to quit this process, select Quit.FIND AND UNINSTALL THE MALICIOUS PROGRAM Next, it's time to find and uninstall the unwanted program. Even if you didn't see anything you thought was malware in the Activity Monitor, still go through this process.Open your Applications folder.If you know the name of the malware, find the application in the list. If you aren't sure of its name, look for any suspicious program you don't remember installing.Pay attention to new folders and recently installed applications.If you're sure you've found the malware's application folder, right-click and select Move to Trash, or drag it to the trash can.Empty the trash can.REMOVE LOGIN ITEMS Login items are programs that launch automatically when your computer boots. If you see an application's window as soon as you log in to your Mac, that's a login item. Malware often sets itself up as a login item so it can relaunch every time your computer boots.From the Apple menu, select System Preferences.Select Users and Groups.Select the Login Items tab.If you see something on this list you don't recognize, or you see known malware, select the item and then choose the Remove (minus sign) icon on the bottom.CLEAN YOUR BROWSERS Many forms of adware and malware install some sort of browser extension or change your browser settings in some way. Most commonly, they change your home page, search engine, or new tab page. Here's how to make sure your browsers are clean.In Chrome, select the More icon (three vertical dots).Select Settings.Click Extensions.Examine your extensions and make sure you know what each one does.If you find an extension that shouldn't be there, select Remove.Next, look at your browser and internet preferences.

The best ones are in my opinion  ClamXav  (that's recently become a commercial product),  Bitdefender ,  Sophos  (good but it slows down your Mac too much). Viruses for Macs aren't so common and can't be written as in Windows, because UNIX systems are rigidly hierarchical.  In Windows, you can mess up a little bit like you want on a home computer; on a UNIX-like system, unless you got administrative privileges, you can't do a darn thing because you need to enter an administrative password (not simply click  Continue , like you do with Windows). Most \"viruses\" for Mac are Trojans or worms attacking your Internet browser and you can easily get rid of most of them by resetting your browser to its default settings. Most are hoax viruses leveraging on a psychological pressure-based scam. The only real threat I'm aware of ( iWorm ) came around along with a pirated Photoshop full version. In this case, you already know there was a risk, so you need to blame mostly yourself, if you got infected with this pesky malware.

To overcome this, be aware of changes around you and adapt accordingly. 2. Risk adverse by nature: many people I know are pretty risk adverse and they prefer to stick to the tried and true rather than venture into the unknown. Life is short - take a few risks or even bigger ones. This does not mean you don't plan or jump headlong into something. Do your research but take some risks. 3. Stubborn: some people are stubborn and won't change their mind or their beliefs or their behaviours. This one is tough because stubborn people also tend to think or believe that they are right. If you happen to be risk adverse and stubborn at the same time, there\u2019s a high chance that you\u2019re stuck. 4. Groundhog Day: if you do what you've always done, you will get what you've always gotten. If it seems like Groundhog Day for you, think about what you can change and what you can do to effect the change. It might be checking in on your emotions and replacing fear or anger or anxiety with boldness, equanimity and calmness. If you can name your emotions, you then have the power to change your thoughts and from there become unstuck. 5. Always looking at the past rather than the present. Be aware of the power of TODAY as the present is a gift and every day is new and every day we have the power to change our thoughts, emotions and actions. I realised this when I had to make a major move to a new country- not once but 5 times. I found that each time got easier and easier as I became more aware and best of all, each time, I had the opportunity to remake myself. All the better today's that we have make for a better tomorrow. I realised that we have the power to rewrite our life scripts and repackage ourselves. It's easier amongst strangers or in a new company or country. But there's nothing to stop us from doing it even in our own current circumstances. If you've tried something before and it didn't work, then tweak it a little. Some things don't work out because the time is not right and the company or the world or your mother may not be ready for something. But that does not mean that it won't work now.

            "Toads are frogs in the family Bufonidae. They lack teeth (frogs normally have small teeth), have a warty appearance, and have visible parotoid glands on their head - they produce poison in these. Toads will tend to hop, while many frogs will make longer leaps - though many frogs aren\u2019t much for distance jumping, either. And ugly? Aww. I think they\u2019re cute, especially the neonates (fresh out of the water babies).",

In the meantime, the learning process can feel daunting: You want to get your meaning across correctly and smoothly, but putting your ideas into writing comes with the pressure of their feeling more permanent. This is why consistent, tailored suggestions are most helpful for improving your English writing abilities. Seeing specific writing suggestions based on common grammatical mistakes multilingual speakers make in English is key to improving your communication and English writing fluency. Regular feedback is powerful because writing in a language that isn\u2019t the first one you learned poses extra challenges. It can feel extra frustrating when your ideas don\u2019t come across as naturally as in your primary language. It\u2019s also tough to put your writing out there when you\u2019re not quite sure if your grammar and wording are correct. For those communicating in English in a professional setting, your ability to write effectively can make all the difference between collaboration and isolation, career progress and stagnation. Grammarly Premium helps multilingual speakers sound their best in English with tailored suggestions to improve grammar and idiomatic phrasing. Especially when you\u2019re writing for work, where time often is in short supply, you want your communication to be effortless. In addition to offering general fluency assistance, Grammarly Premium now includes tailored suggestions for writing issues common among Spanish, Hindi, Mandarin, French, and German speakers, with more languages on the way.Features for all multilingual speakers Grammarly\u2019s writing suggestions will catch the most common grammatical errors that multilingual speakers make in English. For example, if you drop an article or misuse a preposition (such as \u201con\u201d instead of \u201cin\u201d), our sidebar will flag those mistakes within the Fix spelling and grammar category with the label Common issue for multilingual speakers. Most importantly, it will provide suggestions for fixing them. While these errors seem small, one right after another can make sentences awkward and more difficult to absorb. Eliminating them all in one fell swoop is a powerful way to put a more fluent spin on your document. Features for speakers of specific languages With Grammarly Premium, speakers of French, German, Hindi, Mandarin, and Spanish can get suggestions specifically tailored to their primary language, unlocking a whole other level of preciseness in written English. For speakers of those languages, our sidebar will flag \u201cfalse friends,\u201d or cognates, which are words or phrases that have a similar form or sound in one\u2019s primary language but don\u2019t have the same meaning in English. But now Grammarly Premium\u2019s writing suggestions will catch these types of errors for you and provide suggestions on how to fix them. You can find these suggestions in the Sound more fluent category in our floating sidebar.

And there were some pretty clear rules about what features frogs and toads had and didn't have. Neither had claws or teeth and they laid their eggs in water and did not tend them. Then we started studying frogs and toads in the Southern Hemisphere and especially in the jungles of the world (most of which are in the Southern Hemisphere) all of the lines we drew between frogs and toads in the Northern Hemisphere became so blurred it became clear that they are pretty much one kind of animal. And then we started finding examples of clawed frogs and toothed frogs, frogs that carried their eggs on their back and even one that has holes in it's back into which its eggs are placed and grow into tadpoles and then into toadlets finally emerging and climbing out of the holes and going about their business. So, now we know frogs and toads are pretty much all one kind of animal with many and varied species with all kinds of different features and life cycles and living in all manner of environments. Since there has never been any \u201cscientific\u201d definitions for \u201cfrogs\u201d vs. \u201ctoads\", today most scientists use just the word frog (if they choose to use a common term) for the whole group.

            "Neither toads nor frogs are species in themselves; there are many species of toad, and likewise many species of frogs. To answer this question, it\u2019s important to understand the ways that evolutionary trees work. An evolutionary tree is called a phylogeny, or phylogenetic tree.

We can use these trees to talk about groups (taxa, singular = taxon) of organisms.Here are some examples. Taxon 1 is known as a clade, because it includes a species B as well as all the descendants of B, so is monophyletic. Taxon 2 includes two species that aren\u2019t actually closely related to each other but might look similar because of convergent evolution - the same selective pressures have formed two relatively unrelated organisms to look the same - so is polyphyletic. Taxon 3 includes a common ancestor A but not all of the descendants of A, so is paraphyletic. Toads and frogs together form the Anurans, and here\u2019s a phylogeny of Anura:You can see it\u2019s pretty complicated. What we find, though, when we look for toads, is that they\u2019re polyphyletically distributed throughout the Anura. Toads evolved multiple times from frog species (so in answer to your question, toads are generally younger evolutionarily-speaking than frogs) and are not at all necessarily closely related to each other within the Anura. Toads are generally much stouter, thicker-limbed, wartier and drier than frogs are. This is because toads are less aquatic in their lifestyle and live more on land. Anura are basal tetrapods, diverging earlier from the first four-footed fish to inhabit land than any of the other tetrapods like the sauropsids (reptiles, birds) or mammals. Frogs stays dependant on water, and where there was little water, or there were other ecological niches to evolve into, frogs did so and thus became drier, more terrestrial toads. Hope that helps!",

Toads tend to be more relaxed, as they have thicker skin, and, as already mentioned in other comments, poison glands. I\u2019ve seen a very cute video clip of something similar to what Bill Fife describes in his comment: A toad being scratched on or behind the poison glands, and leaning this and that way to get both sides scratched equally :) So, while humans are big and therefore perceived as a threat, especially to non-poisonous frogs, the response also depends on the individual to some extent.",

No biggie, shit happens\u2026 She returned and we loaded into the car without incident. We made it about 30 miles down the road when Pisgah (our dog), in his normal place resting his head in between the two front seats, began to hiccup and burp. And it smelled\u2026 Oh God, it smelled awful! And then he retched and the entire center console, gear shifter, and part of the dashboard in my car were suddenly covered in a torrent of not-particularly-solid human poop, complete with camp-safe toilet paper! \u201cOh my God, is that\u2026!?\u201d Suddenly everything that I thought I knew about the world was wrong. The smell was blinding. I nearly lost control of the car as the two of us retched and screamed. It was in that moment, in a mobile port-a-potty screeching between the lanes on an Upper Peninsula highway, that I realized: there is no God, there is only shit; there is no you or me, there is only brown-spattered plastic panels; there is no meaning, only biodegradable toilet paper and stench. In other words, I became moderately more optimistic. I never thought, as a man without children, that the interior of my car would ever be so unusually adorned with human poop. We had a single napkin in the glove compartment and another 20 miles to go before we hit the next gas station. We briefly considered abandoning the car and cutting our losses, but we were hundreds of miles from home. \u201cOh my God, clean it up!\u201d \u201cYou clean it up!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m driving and it\u2019s your shit!\u201d Like most arguments I have ever had with a woman, I lost. I ended up smearing the mess around with our single napkin while trying to drive. It was like some kind of horrible finger painting contest in hell. Pisgah looked like he found the whole ordeal to be quite funny and got the bright idea to try to give us kisses to calm us down. Eventually we made it to a gas station and bought some cleaning supplies, and six short months later the car barely smelled anymore. We now bury our business deep and put a rock or a log over it. \u2018Cuz, really, shit happens\u2026",

By very late afternoon I was already exhausted, but dad kept wanting to truck on, to find a better spot for the night, but he finally gave in to my whining, and agreed to camp near a stream, with not a spot of level ground, The bottom zipper of our tent turned out to be broken. Big deal, right? In the middle of the night I awoke. Dad\u2019s telling me to shut up and DO NOT MOVE. I realize his whispers are coming from above me. After several confused seconds, I realized that, due to the incline upon which we\u2019d pitched tent, gravity, assisted by the low-friction interface between my nylon-shell sleeping bag and the floor of the tent had allowed me to slide, through the failed zipper, halfway out of the tent, such that my legs were entirely outside the tent, though still inside the sleeping bag. Then I felt something shoving at my feet and legs. I confess, I damn near shit myself. No need for Dad to tell me to be quiet. I was paralyzed. Then we heard what sounded like a dog shaking itself, but in super-slow motion. Then, some heavy breathing and sniffing against the tent. And then, our visitor wandered off. I slowly pulled myself back into the tent, but didn\u2019t sleep another wink. At dawn, we left the tent to find bear paw tracks all around us. Dad\u2019s now 80. Still walks a couple of miles a day.

I was wiggling my ass, hoping to set myself up for some morning sex, when I felt the first pang in my gut. Another quickly followed. I rolled away from Him. Laid my hands on my tummy and felt my bowels churn. Fuck. I made my way out of the tent, doubled over in pain. I stumbled the 25 yards or so to our makeshift bathroom, where I proceeded to cry with pain and such a strong need to bear down and push, I hadn\u2019t felt anything like it since delivering my last child. I remained in that state for a solid 15 to 20 minutes I bet. I soaked my t-shirt. I had sweat pouring from my face. I had no idea what the fuck was wrong, but knew something wasn't right. And then it passed. There was a definite \u201cclink\u201d in the bucket we used as a commode. What the fuck was that? And my mind flashed back to the night before. At some point when we were around the fire. And my Hubby had pulled out a metal butt plug. I remember it going in. I didn\u2019t remember it coming out. It proved to be the plug. And the pain stopped pretty much instantly. With no further damage than a bruised ego about the whole ordeal. And a horribly embarrassing story to tell, all about how I lost a butt plug in my ass in the middle of forest and lived to tell the tale.",

In reality, lemmings are small rodents that are found in the Arctic and subarctic regions, and they do not intentionally or collectively run into the sea to end their lives. The misconception likely arose from occasional migratory behavior of lemmings, during which they may travel in large groups and sometimes accidentally fall off cliffs or into bodies of water due to overcrowding or disorientation. However, this behavior is not a deliberate suicidal act, but rather a result of natural population dynamics and migration patterns. Overall, the idea of lemmings intentionally running to the sea as an evolutionary behavior is not supported by scientific evidence, and the concept of lemming suicide is largely a myth perpetuated by popular culture.",
            "The evolutionary basis is that humans evolved big complex brains which crave stimulation, leading to some humans fabricating the story about lemmings running into the sea, to the point of using shovels to throw lemmings into the sea while filming them falling in, for the entertainment of other humans.

That concept has become an urban legend and spawned a lot of cartoons.[1] [2] Lots of places on the internet will tell you that a Disney film, White Wilderness, invented the myth of lemmings running to the sea or over cliffs to their death. But they were just trying to show something that everyone knew really happened. It was really hard for them to film that because they made the film in a place that didn\u2019t have any lemmings and was far from the ocean.[3] [4] They wouldn\u2019t have gone to so much trouble if they didn\u2019t think they were filming something that really happened. Lemmings are an Arctic rodent. They are tubular and have very short tails. They are related to and resemble voles found at lower lattitudes. [5]Lemmings have a very peculiar biological feature. Their numbers go through boom and bust cycles. In one year, there may be a great many of them but then they die out and disappear. This chart shows population numbers at two arctic locations. Churchill and Pearce Point. Notice that at Churchill, there might be more than 30 lemmings per hectare on some years but almost none in other years. There\u2019s a similar cycle at Pearce Point but the ups and downs appeared more frequently.[6]During years when they are abundant, many of them will do dangerous things that cause them to die. Anyone who sees that could assume that they are committing suicide. We don\u2019t fully understand the reasons for these cycles. It\u2019s not hard to see why numbers build up quickly. They have large litters and can breed several times each year. When weather is favorable and predators are scarce, lemmings can build up numbers pretty quickly. The causes of the crash are less well understood. Predators may become more common and eat them up. I have been told that they don\u2019t ever run out of food but that remains a possibility. Predators, like owls and foxes, may become more common and eat lots of lemmings. In some animals, levels of stress hormones go up when populations are dense, maybe because of fighting or just the sheer stress of having too many neighbors too close. That would reduce resistance to disease and cause animals to run away. Stress might also cause problems with pregnancy and maybe cause males to attack young. Similar boom and bust cycles can happen in other species. Similar cycles have been reported for rabbits and lynx.[7] You can read a good discussion here: [8]It\u2019s interesting to ask whether something like this might ever happen in people. Our population has increased a lot in recent centuries. Maybe the number of people will stabilize at a high level. But if it doesn\u2019t, we might overpopulate exhaust our resources and our numbers might crash, just like lemmings.Footnotes[1] Redirect Notice[2] so far so good By toons[3] Lemming Suicide Is a Myth That Was Perpetuated by Disney[4] Did Disney Fake Lemming Deaths for the Nature Documentary 'White Wilderness'?[5] Lemming Suicide Myth, Alaska Department of Fish and Game[6] https://watermark.silverchair.com/77-1-8.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAjowggI2BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggInMIICIwIBADCCAhwGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM0AbthsLJktAb1mOzAgEQgIIB7d_gRuLy8wVTFn3d3KReO43FBVQoB01sJDp7H4e5YfV8ySMkDVfuj70haRgdE7xzg_bTG6Ls4ibJuDsfnBdQPJ_m-zh4Rkju8Bn2cySvUfyCk5AhCC8-Bfa-x_prjHzBIobnKNilonxynXV89gopXQWn2stIaCK3dSdCtMhukjz1XigApVevLT3WwvZnzScFkf_4XIYr1bb1aQVlWu2xYJdc8GCpFoQqJWczwuNKLiXmFycAA16lfaKPMt25eDnWefKDMLQ2__U2vm9VbHQtCklkCVV0VCk9_QRkJQir_cWFYkJ8LHakZa9042O6QogXiKERJvjQiFt9ORng3wyu0QlHL7Wsaii_65ijuPDqgvxa2bjVU2UZthym7kyGX8IbL6reO0YmbJUkaKjKmPIZWNN7Aj26_7Yz_BcrbWGBaMIz_q7Fqxb5cPT9g5vUsSYZz7inK515vHdm9vBKgRXYVi_wz8JkAmB9epoRdnzwXLgaxDk0n3UFiuSD41ZjPdhSA2v09yj0H32ipaciJIidBfqVm1ZPTRKTmGFVmrERhbsH5Jv9_cNaeuYw3Q85FNzS6gQYNgNvhwMtVVpxpeipVtC0cf32b8PgSqZ9jGzCUgR67Zb_FHlmzgcSjh8QtLZyMvOzcMVV3iDgiUdIVqg[7] https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/BIO313-Population-Cycles-v2-FINAL-Demary.pdf[8] Population regulation",

This dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive, deliberate mass suicide depicted in the Disney film \u201cWhite Wilderness\u201d The lemming suicide scenes in the Disney movie were actually shot in Calgary, Alberta, which is shortgrass cattle country, not the high Arctic. They had to import lemmings from the Arctic, but they only needed a few dozen, and just made it appear that there were more using camera angles. I\u2019ve seen outtakes of them shooting the scenes. Since lemmings will not voluntarily jump over cliffs into the water, they had to put them on a turntable and spun them off into the Bow River. The whole thing was just faking an urban myth. Disney shot of lot of movies in Southern Alberta near where I grew up, since it has a lot of wilderness areas, and most of their depictions of animal behavior were as fictional as the lemmings in \u201cWhite Wilderness\u201d. Wild animals just don\u2019t behave the way Disney depicted them. Their movies were pure entertainment with little factual content. I remember one time they brought in a tame hawk to shoot some scenes in a wild area near where I grew up, because it was open prairie but had no homes, roads, power lines or other indications of modern civilization. Unfortunately, about 100 of the local hawks objected, descended on their tame hawk, and killed it because it had intruded into their territory. Life in the wilderness is a struggle for survival for animals. It is nasty, brutish, and short. The wilderness is usually not how Disney depicted it. Since there is very little real wilderness left in the US, the Hollywood producers used to come up to Canada to shoot their movies, but they used trained animals, not wild ones. Viewers in the US having no experience with real wild animals believed them and formed their opinions based on pure fiction. Watching Hollywood film crews film movies was just absolutely hilarious. The amount of money they spent was mind-boggling and the things they used to do to fake the scenes were amazing. These lemmings didn\u2019t jump, they were pushed.

Let\u2019s get ourselves into this with Amber\u2019s Storytime, shall we? \u2022______________________________\u2022 Lee Seo-yeon was a pretty girl. Well, not just a pretty girl, but no one knew her as anything but a pretty girl. Ever since she was around ten, she had boys asking her out-which was just plain creepy. Of course, she\u2019d reject them. They didn\u2019t know who she was like on the inside, they just saw her pretty face. One day, there was a new girl at school. She\u2019d taken one look at Seo-yeon, and said, \u201cWow, you\u2019re so pretty! You should TOTALLY be a k-pop idol!\u201d The words stuck in Seo-yeon\u2019s head for a long time after that. \u2022______________________________\u2022 TWELVE YEARS LATER: Seo-yeon clutched the envelope in her hands, too scared to open it. She sat, knees bunched together, on the couch. Her best friend-and roommate, Leapt into the room like a lemming jumping off a cliff. \u201cSeo-yeon! You\u2019re debuting!\u201d That was the happiest moment of her life. After all, it had been her dream since 10 years old. The training was hard, but now her life was practically complete. Right? \u2022______________________________\u2022 ONE YEAR LATER: Who\u2019s your bias in EMBER? Who is the most talented in EMBER? Who is the prettiest member in EMBER? A girl looked through all of the questions on quora about the group. She read through all of the answers, curious about this . She suddenly saw a picture and one line: Lee Seo-yeon, Main vocalist, Visual. The more she scrolled, the more she noticed how many people liked her. The girl decided that this girl was pretty, sure, but did she have talent and discipline? Into the internet she went, until she found it. The ends of her mouth quirked. Aha. Not that I expected anything else from a lazy visual. \u2022______________________________\u2022 LEE SEO-YEON BULLYING SCANDAL THe words burned into her brain, threatening tears. And with then, she knew, came the hate. Wow, a scandalous member? Totally expected that. EMBER\u2019s image has been TOO good. LOL, this always happens to visuals. She\u2019s a brat? Expected. Let the beauty get to her head, haha. She doesn\u2019t deserve her fame. Seo-yeon knew this would come one day or another. The misunderstandings from her years in high school came back to haunt her. NO matter what she explained, she knew it would come off wrong, and no one would believe her. Visual. The word was haunting. She\u2019s gotten in because off her vocals, not her visuals. Was she only popular because she was pretty? The pretty face she had was becoming her cage. \u2022______________________________\u2022 Lazy Visual. Why is Seo-yeon the center again? She didn\u2019t even apologize. I can\u2019t stand her. EMBER should totally just be a 4-member group. Why is she even POPULAR? Of course, there were good comments too. Y\u2019all are hella sensitive. Seo-yeon is nice, she wouldn\u2019t do that. Misunderstandings happen. Guys, Seo-yeon\u2019s vocals have improved FURTHER. How? The girl\u2019s a goddess, I swear. But Seo-yeon couldn\u2019t bring herself to believe them. Maybe she was just a lazy visual after all. She tied up her hair, looking at herself in the mirror, clutching a pair of scissors in her hands. Maybe I\u2019m too sensitive. Real idols don\u2019t do this. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not a real idol. *SLASH* \u2022______________________________\u2022 I may be exaggerating. I may know nothing about K-Pop. This may be a terrible example. But it doesn\u2019t matter how you got popular, you just are. And people might not like that, and they can think it, bust calling people undeserving is just not nice. We all deserve people who like us, whether for our face or our content. We all need the satisfaction of seeing 10 followers grow to 20, 30, 50, and beyond.

I just laugh and nod along, too afraid to say stuff out loud. It\u2019s easier to write things with periods and not cutting corners by text. But no one thinks I\u2019m fake, because I\u2019m consistent, I\u2019m good at thinking before I text. And that\u2019s okay, because I\u2019m not hurting people in secret. I\u2019m not putting on a personality for my own means of gain. It\u2019s just my default, is that wrong? We\u2019ve all been fake polite, fake encouraging, after all. Everyone tells white lies and stretches the truth sometimes. Is that wrong? Apparently not. It\u2019s been accepted. And sometimes, people have this sort of idea that if someone\u2019s realistic and consistent, they\u2019re genuine. News flash, it\u2019s really not, because we\u2019re all pretty good actors, even if we don\u2019t know it. I not here to say that everyone is fake. I\u2019m here to say that you\u2019re not being you online because you don\u2019t know who you are in real life. After all, we\u2019re hiders, cowards. We\u2019re trying to make something for ourselves. And guess what? Maybe it\u2019s been so long since you\u2019ve actually done something the real you would have done, instead of what you\u2019ve made of yourself would have done. Maybe you\u2019re not fake anymore because the fact that you\u2019re fake is so real. Fake is no longer an insult. It\u2019s a truth. And if we\u2019re not hurting anyone, backstabbing anyone, using anyone, and we\u2019re just sitting there in our fake little bubbles with our fake little personas\u2026 Is it really not okay for us to be fake? I know a girl who IS fake. After all, she wanted to be interesting. Tucking back her shy personality, she talked and talked and talked, made a bunch of friends. She acted extroverted, sweet, obsessively helpful. Sure, there were people who hated her, but others who loved her. And that gave the girl confidence to keep her persona. And the longer she kept it up, the more it became HER. She grew up to be a motivational speaker. And she was no longer fake, because that was her now, and she helped so many people. Those who really knew her, even forgot about the shy girl she was once. She\u2019s not fake. But another girl was. She was quiet and mousy, and no one liked her. One day, she decided to try makeup\u2014caked it all on her face. But she still wasn\u2019t good enough\u2026 So then came the clothes. The flaunting money. The bribing others to become friends, the desperate need to be liked. And then the plastic surgery, once she turned eighteen. Everyone pretended to like her, but no one really did. Everytime someone would ask about the girl, they would say: \u201cI miss that way she was when she was younger. So genuine.\u201d But they never said that to the first girl. Why? Because it\u2019s okay to be fake, only if your fakeness is an improvement from your real self. So to all those who are hiding behind a persona, it\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t feel any guilt about it, because we\u2019re all like this. Thank you. \u2014Your Cringy Little Bird, Amber",

The former was very uncomfortable but didn\u2019t wan\u2019t to ruin their friendship so she stayed silent. Sadly, that wasn\u2019t the ending point.

This little bit of gritty extra effort is all it takes to make for a peaceful encounter - not to mention much much better images. Of course, there are always a few people who haven\u2019t got the training yet. I once had a guy who decided to follow me along the trail at a favorite state park. Besides his camera, he carried a portable aluminum tripod chair. Instead of quietly approaching the many water birds, he\u2019d walk up as close as possible, throw down the chair with a loud CLANG and fire off dozens of images of frightened birds flying away from his camera. Finally, any decent photo contest will require the entrants to sign off on a statement of animal welfare and ethics before accepting images for consideration. Fleeing frightened animals are not the stuff of award winning portfolios. In my experience, most wildlife photographers do their best to be unobtrusive, if not invisible, to their subjects.

Other than that, what most of the wildlife photographers want is the animal / bird looking towards us as we take the photo. To achieve this, if you go on any safari, the driver sometimes slams the door hard just to make some noise. This will attract the animal\u2019s attention and it looks towards the source of the sound and the photographers start clicking! I know this too is unethical but it does happen many times. Thanks!",

I forgot my home address, can you take me there? \"The driver dropped him to his home and did not even collect his fare from him. (5) Einstein was once traveling from Princeton on a train when the conductor came down the aisle, punching the tickets of every passenger. When he came to Einstein, Einstein reached in his vest pocket. He couldn't find his ticket, so he reached in his trouser pockets. It wasn't there, so he looked in his briefcase, but he couldn't find it. Then he looked in the seat beside him. He still couldn't find it. The conductor said, 'Dr. Einstein, I know who you are. We all know who you are. I'm sure you bought a ticket. Don't worry about it.' Einstein nodded appreciatively. The conductor continued down the aisle punching tickets. As he was ready to move to the next car, he turned around and saw the great physicist down on his hands and knees looking under his seat for his ticket. The conductor rushed back and said, 'Dr. Einstein, Dr. Einstein, don't worry, I know who you are. No problem. You don't need a ticket. I'm sure you bought one.' Einstein looked at him and said, 'Young man, I too, know who I am. What I don't know is where I'm going.'6) When Einstein met Charlie Chaplin: Einstein said, *\"What I admire most about your art, is its universality. You do not say a word, and yet ... the world understands you.\"* \u201cIt's true,\u201d replied Charlie Chaplin, *\"But your fame is even greater: The world admires you, when nobody understands you.\".* In ,1931 Charlie Chaplin invited Albert Einstein, who was visiting Hollywood, to a private screening of his new film, \u2018\u2019City lights''. As the two men drove into town together, passerbys waved and cheered. Chaplin turned to his guest and explained: \u2018\u2019The people are applauding you because none of them understands you and applauding me because everybody understands me''. 7) One of Einstein's colleagues asked him for his telephone number one day.

Can you believe the fact that he could not speak well until the age of three?His teachers did not consider him a good student, and they refused to recommend him for further employment and we all know what he did!Just like me, Albert Einstein also had a poor memory. He could not remember names, dates or phone numbers. The reason he hated studying History so much.This scientist\u2019s favorite scientist was Galileo Galilei .He was once offered presidency of Israel.This photo of him was taken by Arthur Sasse , a photographer persuading him to smile for the camera, on his 72nd birthday. Little did Sasse know that he was already frustrated by smiling all day long for the other photographers he gave this peculiar yet funny look for his photo.Here comes the best known fact about\u2026.not him but his chauffeur :One day,when Einstein was going to a University to deliver his speech on Theory of relativity, His chauffeur remarked while in transit: \u201cDr Einstein, I've heard you deliver that lecture 30 times. i know it by heart and bet i could give it myself\u201d\u201cWell i\u2019ll give you the chance,\u201d Einstein said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know me at the next college, so when we get there i\u2019ll put on your Cap, and you introduce yourself as me and give the lecture\u201d The chauffeur delivered Einstein\u2019s lecture flawlessly. When he was done and about to leave, one of the professors stopped him and asked a complex question filled with mathematical expressions and formulas. The chauffeur thought fast. \u201cThe solution to that problem is so simple,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you have to ask me. In fact, to show just how simple it is, I\u2019m going to ask my chauffeur to come up here and answer your question.\u201d Einstein had a smart Chauffeur too!! Edit: some Quorans are questioning the last point. I have also read it somewhere people and it was quite intriguing, so i thought of sharing it on Quora. I am not sure its a fact or just an anecdote. I would be obliged if someone could prove it true or false.",

Many people have blamed their bad math skills on Einstein with quips like, \u201cWell, Einstein flunked math!\u201d He didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t a bad student. He knew college physics before the age of 11 and mastered languages like Latin and Greek. Oh, and he was a calculus whiz before the age of 15. So, yeah, that excuse is out the window. 2. Einstein really did marry his cousin. For a man with such a high IQ, Einstein did make some strange decisions. He married his own cousin, Elsa Einstein, in 1919. According to Bio.com, they were romantically involved, even in Einstein\u2019s first marriage to Mileva Maric, the only female physics major at Polytechnic, where Einstein attended college. (Mileva and Einstein, left. Elsa and Einstein, right.)Interestingly enough, Einstein isn\u2019t the only famous figure to have married his cousin. Darwin, Allan Poe and Saddam Hussein also married their first cousins. 3. Einstein could have lived longer. When he suffered a burst blood vessel in 1955, doctors told him that surgery could have saved his life. He declined, sayingIt is tasteless to prolong life artificially.\u201d 4. Albert Einstein loved sailing. Along with marrying cousins, it was one of his passions. However, he reportedly never learned to swim. (Hope his boat was sturdy.) 5. Einstein could have been the president of Israel, had he accepted the offer. After Israel\u2019s first president Chaim Weizmann died, Einstein was asked to step up to the plate. He was 73 at the time, and in his letter of refusal cited that he lacked thenatural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people\u201dbut also that he was getting old. 6. Einstein was a serious smoker. Adding to his disheveled image, those around him often found him in a cloud of smoke. He always had his pipe with him. Not limited to the pipe, he also had the occasional cigar and even cigarette. He said of smoking:I believe that pipe smoking contributes to a somewhat calm and objective judgment in all human affairs.\u201d 7. Einstein had a daughter, but we don\u2019t know what happened to her. Before he and Mileva were married, she became pregnant with a daughter, whom she named Lieserl. Einstein didn\u2019t have a job at the time and illegitimate children were frowned upon, so Mileva returned to her parents home and had the child. Einstein did know about her, as he referenced her in some of his letters. But it was such a secret that the fact has only come to light in recent years. It is believed that Lieserl either died of scarlet fever or fought off the fever and was later given up for adoption. 8. Although he was actually good at math, Einstein did fail his college entrance exam. In 1895 when he was 17, Einstein applied for entry at Swiss Federal Polytechnical School. He passed math and science (of course) but failed other subjects. He went to a trade school before he finally took the exam again and passed. 9. Einstein\u2019s brain was stolen. No, I don\u2019t mean his work. I mean his actual brain. Einstein wanted his body to be cremated, brain intact. Thomas Harvey, the pathologist who performed the autopsy, removed it. He kept it for many years in a jar, later relinquishing it to another hospital, where it was cubed. Literally. Sectioned into cubes. Rumor has it that Harvey also removed Einstein\u2019s eyes and they are sitting in a safety deposit box in New York somewhere. Watching us all.10. Yoda = Einstein. Yes, the appearance of Yoda of Star Wars was modeled after Einstein. Those wrinkles? Those eyes? They\u2019re all Einstein.Einstein was a genius, we know that from his IQ. Rarely do we take the time to appreciate him as a person and learn about his past.",

            "Yes, it is a popularly held belief that Albert Einstein struggled with mathematics in his early school days. However, there is some debate among historians and biographers about the extent of his difficulties with the subject. Some sources suggest that he may have had some challenges with certain aspects of mathematics, while excelling in others. Overall, while it is widely believed that he faced academic challenges, it is important to note that Einstein's intellectual achievements and contributions to physics are widely celebrated.",

He always passed them, often getting a rating of 4 on the 6 point scale (while in his other classes he usually got 6 out of 6).  This caused one of his professors, Hermann Minkowski, to say he was a \"lazy dog\". Source: Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson.  Simon & Schuster 2008.",

So they made the whole thing up. Tried to legally have her declared an adult, so they would no longer be financially responsible for her care. Investigators went to the orphanage in Ukraine where Natalia came from, tracked down her birth mother. They proved that her true birth date was 2003, not 1989 as they had claimed. And that her birth mother, confirmed by DNA testing, was born in 1979 and would have been ten when she had Natalia, had their claims been accurate. The story nearly destroyed the girl. Because the adoptive parents went on Dr. Phil, describing her as a fraud and a 22-year-old sociopath. It was such a juicy story the media simply ran with it \u2014 grown-up pretending to be a child to get adopted. She wasn\u2019t. That never happened.More from the same author:Jean-Marie Valheur \u00b7 Dec 1When did comedians become authorities on world affairs?Honestly, they are some of the sharpest minds out there. I\u2019d say the average comedian has powers of observation far above those of the average man or woman in the streets. They\u2019re a lot smart in my opinion than politicians, because a good comedian has no allegiance to any \u201cside\u201d.  George Carlin was a brilliant comedian. He was amazing at what he did, because he didn\u2019t hold back and he was brutally honest. People use his quotes until this day, and they\u2019re razor sharp. And you know they\u2019re good because ALL sides use them. Take for instance the quote I use in the illustration above \u201cpolitical correctness is fascism pretending to be manners\u201d. Brilliant. Often quoted by \u201cthe right\u201d.  Then he also has quotes like the above\u2026 which would no doubt be more appealing to his more left-leaning fans. And herein lies the brilliance of Carlin, or any really good comedian \u2014 their searing wit takes no prisoners, never holds back, and it pokes fun at everyone, more or less in equal measure, wherever something is deserving of mockery. And the mockery doesn\u2019t just make you laugh, it makes you think. Politicians have been \u201cauthorities\u201d on world affairs for as long as there have been good comedians around. Social satire makes things clear with sarcasm and humor that a mere explanation by some boring political commentator wouldn\u2019t explain half as well. They entertain, and after the laughter ends, the thinking starts. It\u2019s why I am fiercely opposed to anyone \u201ccancelling\u201d anyone over a joke.",

But they always had a way of pointing out that there must have been some hidden influence that they had not accounted for; like the King not telling them that the color of the curtains in the dungeon had been changed. Well these astrologers were a clever bunch and they managed to stay one step ahead of the executioner's blade for many generations.But round about 350 years ago a grave threat to these astrologers came on the scene. Have you heard of the scientific method? Just nod. Ahh, very good. Well these scientific method chappies had all sorts of fancy ideas about testing, measurement, evidence, and what not.As you might imagine the astrologers knew their days were numbered. So the astrologers guild held a series of great meetings on the Downs of Folderol to plan for their future.After days of discussion, they decided that their best course of action was to do nothing more than rebrand from astrologers to economists.And that is how economists came to be the great advisors to our leaders.And that, boys and girls, is the greatest hoax of our times; that fortune tellers...er, economists are given such exalted status.",

This guy;a Viking named Leif Erikson, beat him by about 500 years, in about the year 1000. Hitler couldn\u2019t win WW2 if only this or that was done differently Let's look at a few scenarios. What if they hadn\u2019t invaded the USSR? Then the USSR would have invaded them. Just because a peace treaty had been signed doesn\u2019t mean peace would have lasted. And relations were already strained. Furthermore, Stalin could just stop oil exports to the Germans, almost surely ruining them. The Germans initially planned to attack the USSR in 1938/39, after the great purge, when the Red army was at its weakest. What if the Luftwaffe hadn\u2019t switched to civilian bombing? The RAF was far from over at that time. If they hadn\u2019t switched to civilian bombing, then they would\u2019ve still lost, only not as bad and quick. What if operation Sea Lion had happened? Well, it would have failed \u2026.. miserably. The Germans didn\u2019t even have air superiority, let alone naval superiority, but let's imagine they had air superiority. So what difference would it have made? Were they going to build flying tanks? Anyway even if they had succeeded, there were hundreds of thousands of troops in Britain. Plus, they could call back soldiers from other parts of the world. And even Hitler who thought invading the USSR was a good idea knew it would fail. There are more, but you get the point. A lot would have to change to even have a small chance of winning WW2. In short, Operation Sea Lion would have failed\u2026 badly. Those are 4 historical myths. Thanks for reading"

Kumaon is a district in northern India. Jim Corbett lived with his family nearby and gained world-wide fame as a hunter of man-eating tigers. The first and the most famous of his books is \u2018The Man-eaters of Kumaon\u2019. It may not be easy to acquire the book that was published in 1948 or thereabouts. It has been out of print for half a century. It is worth one\u2019s while to search for this classic on animal behaviour. What follows is from that book. It is not natural for tigers to kill and eat humans. But tigers that are injured and find it difficult to catch their normal prey of deer take to man eating. The reasons for their incapacitation can be age and injuries sustained while hunting. Tiger hunters who injure a tiger but do not follow up for the kill are also occasionally responsible for creating man-eaters. Encounter with porcupines leading to damage caused by the quills is an occasional cause for tigers to become man-eaters. One of the stories in Corbett\u2019s book is about a tiger that became a man-eater after it had come out second best in an encounter with a porcupine. This tiger was labelled the Mohan man-eater in government records. Leopards also like the taste of porcupine flesh but it is very rare for them to get injured. Corbett has seen leopards kill porcupines. The porcupines only defence is to turn its back on the aggressor and with quills erect charge by running backwards towards the aggressor. The leopard reaches for and catches the head of the porcupine. Corbett is unable to understand why the much larger tiger does not adapt this obvious tactic. Whatever the reason the tigers get quills penetrating its paws and face. Porcupine quills are hooked. They will not come out when pulled. The tiger only aggravates the injuries in its attempt to pull out the quills. The quills break off at the point of entry and the broken pieces remain buried in the tissues of the tiger forever. The quills do not disintegrate. The wound soon gets infected. The animal is disabled and is in constant pain. The man-eater that was to gain reputation as the Mohan-maneater was in such a plight when a certain event occurred to change its fortunes. An old woman accompanied by a girl were in the forest collecting firewood when the old woman slipped and glissaded down a slope and disappeared. The girl went round the slope and reached the old woman. She had luckily landed on a ledge for otherwise she would have ended on the valley floor a mile below. The injured woman was lying on her back. She was injured and could not move. The two were estimating the hours they will have to wait before search parties arrive when the old woman exclaimed with horror-stricken face. The girl turned round and saw a tiger step on the ledge. When the search party located the old woman, she was in hysterics. Of the girl there was no sign. Later when the woman was able to speak the villagers knew that a tiger had killed the girl and carried her away. That was the Mohan maneater\u2019s first human victim. There were many more before Corbett went to hunt the animal. The villagers gave an interesting insight into the tiger\u2019s physical condition. Tigers move noiselessly even in dense jungle. But the villagers said that they knew when the tiger was roaming the village streets at night by the moaning sound it made as it moved. Corbett concluded that the tiger suffered from a painful disability. The villagers were not that sure for on the occasions they had seen the tiger it seemed to move well. Corbett had a narrow escape when only his sixth sense saved him from becoming a victim himself. The events that led to Corbett finally shooting the tiger was anticlimactic. The tiger had gorged on a young buffalo bait and was sleeping when Corbett placed two shots on its forehead. He was happy to have killed the scourge of the district but the sportsman in him revolted at the idea of not giving the animal a sporting chance to save itself. While skinning the tiger Corbett noticed that one forelimb of the animal was smaller than the other. He left skinning that limb to the end. When later he examined that limb, he found the skin soggy with multiple punctures from which pus was oozing. When he incised the skin and laid open the wound the tissues were pus laden and there were many porcupine quills embedded. in the tissues The crowd of villagers watching the skinning eagerly sought for the quills as souvenirs. Edit: Reader Anbalagan Muthukumaraswamy informs me that the books of Corbett are available in Kindle.",

When I found a convenient porcupine I would approach it with a large block of styrofoam. I would get close to it and let it hit the block of foam with its tail a few times then I'd back up and let it leave.",

I had to take iron tablets for more than a year to bring it back to normal. She also gave me supplements to improve my nutrients like vitaminB6, fish oil, magnesium, amla C and many more.

Though more common in children, pica affects people of all ages and might be particularly pronounced during pregnancy. This disorder is mainly attributed to insufficient mineral content in your diet, with iron and zinc deficiencies among the major causes. Source: What Are the Effects of Eating Raw Rice?",

Feel free to keep or skip any of them: \u2014Throwing rice at the couple after the ceremony as they leave the church. Rice has been replaced with bird seed these days, so the birds don\u2019t choke trying to eat hard, uncooked rice. This symbolizes showers of love or good luck. \u2014Tossing the bouquet. Bride\u2019s single female friends and relatives gather in a group on the dance floor or at the bottom of a staircase, and the bride turns her back on them and tosses her bouquet over her shoulder to the ladies. The one who catches it is supposedly the next one to marry. (That only happens if there\u2019s one lady who is or might be getting engaged, and the friends let her catch it.) \u2014Groom removing the garter. Bride is wearing a satin garter on one thigh (used to hold up stockings prior to pantyhose) and she sits on a chair in the middle of the dance floor. Groom kneels in front of her and reaches up her leg to remove the garter to the sounds of sexy music. Many people think this is cute and playful fun. \u2014Tossing the garter. The groom\u2019s single male friends and relatives stand together and the groom turns his back and tosses the garter to the waiting guys. The one who catches it gets to put the garter on the lady that caught the bouquet. This goes wrong when a very young girl gets the bouquet and there\u2019s no way the man should be putting a garter on the girl, so that step is canceled. Even if the lady is an appropriate age, it\u2019s a silly tradition. Keep the toss; skip putting garter on another guest. \u2014The Bride Cuts the Cake song. Bride and Groom cut the first slice together and then feed each other a piece. This goes wrong when one of them, usually the groom, gets feisty and decides to smash the frosted slice into his bride\u2019s face. She often returns the favor and they laugh. Even if you have it planned, your guests are horrified, uncomfortable and embarrassed for you. Skip the act, choose a nice song, and just take pictures cutting the cake together. \u2014Bride has a special dance with her father, Groom with his mother. The music is usually a song with words from the parent\u2019s point of view (often selected by the parent) looking at their grown up child. This is a very sweet moment for many families, with tears of love and happiness flowing. I loved dancing with my father and it made me feel wonderful to see my daughter dance with her dad. Don\u2019t pass this up if you are fortunate enough to have a living parent that wants to do it. \u2014Go around to guest tables to thank your guests for coming. Be sure you acknowledge as many guests as possible. Many guests will take the opportunity to hand you your gift card when you come around. Set up a gift table with a box for envelopes, and have your wedding coordinator encourage guests to use it so you don\u2019t have to awkwardly carry gift envelopes around. These are traditions I\u2019ve seen at almost every wedding I\u2019ve been to throughout my life. There are many other interesting traditions around the USA and around the world that you might want to use instead, or create and start your own tradition. Good luck to you.",

I went through the emergency room where the trauma team inserted tubes all over my body at a rapid pace to check all my vitals and i must have passed out from the pain because I don\u2019t remember anything else. Then when I woke up, I knew I was in the operating room because I felt cold and I could feel my stomach being patted down because it was jiggling from my excess weight. I could feel my stomach burn with excruciating pain and I remember thinking to myself, i need to let them know I\u2019m awake! I couldn\u2019t open my eyes, i couldn\u2019t move my feet or even twitch my arm to let them know I was awake and I could feel everything. I felt completely paralyzed! I heard the doctors talking to each other and then I felt the sewing! My stomach was being sewed shut! It was horrible, I remember feeling the needle piercing my flesh and the thread pulling through to the next stitch! I kept trying to move but it was no use, so I laid there enduring the pain and when i felt a tear run out of my eye down the side of my face, and then the last thing I remember, I was waking up in recovery. I found out later, that I had broken all the ribs on my left side and punctured my left lung. Apparently one of my ribs also lascerated my spleen so they had to cut my abdomen from my pubic bone to my breastbone to remove my spleen. I was advised to try to avoid coughing because I had staples holding my stomach together. I asked my nurse if I also had stitches and I was told \u201cYes, but those will dissolve on thier own\u201d. I then told her that I had woken up during the surgery and I couldn\u2019t move, she listened to me but didn\u2019t make any comments either way, but it\u2019s a memory that will be with me for as long as I live. Since then I have had 2 more surgeries and I have told the anesthesiologist each time that I have previously woken up and both times they have assured me it won\u2019t happen again; so far it hasn\u2019t, but that fear is there and it won\u2019t go away.

The surgeon said that if I wanted to remain awake, that would be OK with him. He would apply only local anesthetic. Indeed, I watched the whole procedure. The only negative was that the surgeon asked me to stop asking so many questions; I was distracting him. The evening after the surgery, I felt very good, and asked to go home. The nurse said I could not; not because of the cut in my arm, but because of the long effects of anesthesia; it would be dangerous if I got sick and, for example, vomited when my wound was still not healed. I told her that I did not have general anesthesia, only local. She seemed surprised, and with some degree of skepticism, checked my charts. \u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d, she said. \u201cYou can go home now if you wish, but we advise you to stay overnight.\u201d I decided to leave (I hate hospitals). My wife was amazed and delighted. I had another similar experience with my dentist. For a long root-canal procedure, he asked me if I would be interested in trying nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas, instead of local anesthesia. I was curious and gave it a try. It was a fascinating experience. I could feel the pain\u2014and yet I didn\u2019t mind the pain. (It reminded me of the famous scene in the movie \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d.) I watched the dentist drill deeper and deeper, and several times motioned for him to move the mirror so I could watch better. During short breaks I asked him what he was going to do next. At the end he said to me that he has given nitrous oxide many times, but in every previous case the patient just drifted off into dreams. I was the only patient he had ever had who kept on asking questions when under laughing gas. I guess I just find real life far more interesting than dreams.",

There are hot and cold days. Sunny and overcast days. Clear and rainy days. A day can start sunny and end in rain. You can walk out in your shorts and have to wear pants and a light jacket by the end of the day. Also, the days are unbelievably long. The sun rises before 5 AM and sets at around 10 PM.WWII and the Holocaust. I am of Jewish descent. Many of my ancestors were taken to Auschwitz and other camps to be exterminated. I remember the first time I saw a stolperstein or \u201cstumbling stone\u201d in Berlin (these are brass plates inscribed with the names of Jews and information about the dates of their deportation and extermination, inlaid in the pavement outside their last place of residence) I froze. My heart sank, and a deep sadness welled from within me.Ethnic Diversity here is wonderful. There seem to be people from all over the world, all co-existing. Yes, there have been some glitches, but seeing this melting pot of diversity brings hope to the heart. Plus, you can have authentic food from almost anywhere\u2014from Mexican to Vietnamese to Turkish to Lebanese to Korean, etc., etc.Many, many people are tattooed, so much so that un-tattooed individuals seem rarer than tattooed ones. And so much so that I sometimes wonder if even the businessmen and women, under those fine tailored suits, are hiding some large and colorful dragon or tiger adorning their skins.I assumed Berlin would be cleaner. Before I came I had a vision of Germany as a glinting-clean place. And although it\u2019s not filthy, there\u2019s some waste strewn about in parks and on the streets\u2014empty beer bottles and food leftovers and dirty plastic packaging, etc.And speaking of beer bottles, people drink alcohol. A lot of it. I see many people walking around with some kind of drink in their hands, or people sitting outside bars or even in parks with an unbelievable amount of empty bottles by their side. Or in supermarkets, walking out with cartfuls of booze.Maybe I notice it more because I\u2019ve never lived in a place with so many churches, but there are so many of them here. Imposing ones with rising spires and crimson bricks and huge bells resonating blocks and blocks away. Having grown up in Israel, I find it hard to imagine how the visions of a carpenter in the Middle-East, over centuries and millennia, transmogrified into these massive, gothic places of worship in a completely different culture and milieu.The other day we went to a pleasant park and there were a bunch of kids playing in the nude, splashing each other with water and running around in the sand giggling. My son took off his clothes and joined them, and I thought, how wonderful that no one is embarrassed seeing naked kids playing around, that they are granted this easy, unconscious freedom that in many other parts of the would would have been considered inappropriate.Sex seems to be less of a big deal here. I\u2019ve seen a number of adverts in the street depicting some form of sex in illustrations. In the US, there would have been a lecherous quality to it, some kind of cleavage or exposed thighs, something to suggest and tease and taunt. But here there is something unassuming about its depiction\u2014a couple or even a threesome lying in bed covered in blankets, a cartoon of a man with his loins covered by a popping champagne bottle and a smiling woman by his side. Unassertive\u2014as if this, too, is a natural part of life and there\u2019s no need to make a fuss about it.Organic food is available in most supermarkets and is not necessarily exorbitantly priced. In fact, almost every little place that serves food will have some kind of organic lemonade or soft drink.Although I am not vegetarian, when I came here I imagined w\u00fcrste (sausages) everywhere, and a dearth of other, non-pork based offering. But, in fact, it is very easy to get vegetarian food here. From vegetarian gem\u00fcse kebap (Turkish food\u2014vegetables in bread) to vegetarian asian dishes, to tofu, grain- or legume-based meat substitutes in supermarkets, it is not only possible to be vegetarian here, but even easy.The streets and the curb are wide and spacious, oftentimes cobbled and shaded by evenly-distanced stately trees. Having grown up in Israel and lived in India, this was novel for me\u2014this European expansiveness.Some people can be incredibly proper and strict here. I\u2019ve been scolded for standing out in the street when the bus came, and then for standing in the wrong place inside the bus as I was paying. In some places and settings people are expected to behave in a certain ways, and are frowned upon if they are not.The bicycle is a serious mode of transportation with its own lanes and a substantial number of riders.Drivers are not as courteous as in other places\u2014in less trafficked streets with no stoplight, and unlike the US, cars will mostly not stop when they see a pedestrian, and one has to wait for an opportunity to cross.Things are well made. The walls of the apartment I\u2019m staying in are almost as thick as my outstretched arm. The woodwork is precise and sturdy. Some of the buildings around look like they\u2019ve been in existence for centuries, and that they will last for many centuries more. There is an assuring sturdiness in the material existence here\u2014like things are dependable and robust. Also, it is not difficult to find objects that are Made in Germany or Europe\u2014be it knives or rucksacks or wallets, etc.\u2014that look like they will last for a lifetime. I like that.Almost all shops are closed on Sundays.Parcels are left with neighbors. If you\u2019re not in and you have a package, it will be left with one of your neighbors, who will then, perhaps later in the day, come knocking on your door and claim the package with a slip.People have been incredibly helpful. When I arrived, a neighbor helped carry our luggage from the street. Another neighbor helps me whenever I need something in German translated. I\u2019ve had people in the street, after asking for directions, pull out their phones, search for the place, and give me clear instructions. Of course, as with everywhere else, there are also unfriendly people, but the friendly and helpful ones have left a greater impression on me.",

And top it all off by stating\u2026 \u201cconsidering my numbers, I\u2019m surprised that I\u2019m even conscious!\u201dThe telling it like it is culture shock: I once asked a German friend: \u201cDo you think I\u2019m fat?\u201d His answer: \u201cNot for an American.\u201d I of course was insulted. Hurt. Upset. But the thing is this\u2026.don\u2019t go fishing for compliments in Germany. If you\u2019re fat and you want someone in Germany to tell you that you aren\u2019t, forget it. That person doesn\u2019t exist.Small food portion culture shock: I was invited to a restaurant once as part of a welcome dinner to Germany and promptly ordered my dinner. When it arrived I told the waitress, \u201cExcuse me, there must be a mistake because I didn\u2019t order the kids menu.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the kids menu. It was the normal adult menu. And upon hearing this I said, \u201cthen I\u2019ll take 2 please.\u201dService culture shock: In Germany waiters don\u2019t work for tips. This means that when you say to the waiter, \u201ccheck please\u201d when you\u2019re done with the meal, \u2026he\u2019ll often understand this as a perfect opportunity to go on his break or quit his job forever and emigrate to New Zealand.Condom Machine culture shock: Germans aren\u2019t prudish at all. And this is why they even have condom machines in the mens room at IKEA. I once asked a German friend, \u201ccan you believe it, condom machines at IKEA?\u201d He looked at me in a rather puzzled way and asked, \u201cwhy not? As long as they\u2019re not made out of wood.\u201d What an answer, right?Telling time culture shock: Germans have a complicated way of telling time. You\u2019ll ask someone what time it is and you\u2019ll hear, \u201cits 5 minutes past half eight.\u201d \u201cF\u00fcnf Minuten nach halb Acht.\u201d I almost had a seizure the first time I heard this had it not been for the guy who told me in English, \u201cits 7:35.\u201dMahlzeit culture shock: when you go to a public building to get your visa extended, register your car, your apartment, your dog or your baby, you\u2019ll hear people muttering the word \u201cMahlzeit\u201d to one another along Kafka-like hallways. This is what German civil servants say when it gets close to meal time and its time to take a break. If you want to fit in, answer with a \u201cMahlzeit\u201d of your own. Change the tonality and have fun with it. Walk down the hallway yelling \u201cMahlzeit, Mahlzeit, Mahlzeit, Mahlzeit.\u201d And no one will look at you like you\u2019re weird.Nudity in the sauna culture shock: If you visit a German sauna its mostly, as Germans call it, a textile free environment. But the great thing about it is that no one cares. Its all random body parts sweating together. Big, small, long, short? Who cares? O.K. I do but they don\u2019t.Last but not least driving on the German Autobahn culture shock: The German Autobahn usually has 3 lanes with 3 different speed levels. And they are Fast, Faster and Mach 3! If you want to drive slowly stay to the right. If you want to break the sound barrier stay to the left. If you don\u2019t want to do either of these things take the train.I hope that this was helpful.",

Not one step before the box, but when inside. It was my first day in Germany and the respect towards rules and regulations really left me awestruck. I was impressed that no one was trying to be a \u2018badass\u2019. Shock 2:I had an appointment with my University professor at 12 noon. But, when I reached there (on time, of course), he was having lunch. He saw me, left eating and started discussing the project I was interested in. I felt bad that I was interrupting his lunch and asked him to finish his lunch and that I could wait. I insisted multiple times. It shocked me when he said, \u201cWhen I say it\u2019s okay, it is okay.\u201d I learned that people in Germany value not only their own time but also the time of others. When I told about this to my German roommates, they told me that there is no need to insist multiple times. It is sufficient to ask for just once. This is quite different from India, where asking multiple times is considered polite. Example while eating, we often say, \u201cPlease take another roti.\u201dShock 3:In universities and offices, people usually turn up 5\u201310 minutes in advance. They are not on time but arrive ahead of time. There are exceptions, of course. For example, long distance Deutsche Bahn are often late (Source). However, they are trying to tackle this issue and Deutsche Bahn does provide compensation if you miss a connection. Their terms and conditions are modeled accordingly and are here (Your passenger rights in rail transport). Shock 4:The stand on nudity is quite liberal in Germany. I was surprised to see a naked guy in the locker room of my gym. But, he didn\u2019t even flinch. He just carried on as if there was nothing out of place. This happened during my first week in Germany and now, I am not even bothered by it.I just keep my eyes down when entering, because I am still not cool enough for the culture here. :p Shock 5:I like to cook my meals and like it spicy (read hot). When I eat out, I find the food here is not spicy enough for me. And every time, I ask them for some chilli/curry powder, I get the \u201clook\u201d. :D You\u2019ll understand the \u201clook\u201d if you see the \u201cFalafel Teller\u201d in the photo below. :D A Falafel Teller has lots of fries, some falafel and a good portion of salad. It is my favorite healthy junk food in Germany. :PShock 6:On my first day, I was in the shop getting a local SIM for myself. Unfortunately, I was standing too close to the person in front of me (for his comfort at least). The person in front of me was about 60 years or so. He looked back at me twice or thrice, expecting me to take the hint and move a bit back. I, naturally, didn\u2019t understand why he kept looking back. He, finally, said, \u201cCould you please move back a bit?\u201d And I obliged his request. Personal space in Germany is larger than in India. It is not appreciated when you invade their personal space. As a general rule of thumb, I, now, maintain about an arm\u2019s distance. NOTE: This is not racism, but just a difference in cultural values. Try not to take such incidents personally.Shock 7:To see beer being distributed (during fests) in the University.

The right diet can help control blood sugar levels, as well as reduce the risk of long-term complications. For people with diabetes, there is no single diet that is best. Rather, the best diet for managing diabetes is one that is tailored to the individual's needs and lifestyle. A diet for managing diabetes should be high in fiber, low in saturated and trans fats, and include plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Eating a variety of foods is important, as it helps to ensure that all essential nutrients are consumed. It is also important to limit foods that are high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. When it comes to carbohydrates, the focus should be on consuming complex carbohydrates that are high in fiber, such as whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables. These foods provide sustained energy and help to control blood sugar levels. Simple carbohydrates, such as those found in sugary foods and drinks, should be avoided or limited, as they can cause blood sugar levels to spike. In addition to carbohydrates, protein is an important part of a diabetes-friendly diet. Protein helps to slow the absorption of carbohydrates, which helps to control blood sugar levels. Lean sources of protein, such as fish, chicken, and beans, are best. Healthy fats are also an important part of a diabetes-friendly diet. Unsaturated fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil, can help to improve cholesterol levels. Saturated and trans fats, such as those found in processed foods, should be avoided or limited. Finally, it is important to include plenty of fruits and vegetables in a diabetes-friendly diet. Fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and they can help to control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of long-term complications. In addition to following a healthy diet, people with diabetes should also aim to be physically active. Regular physical activity can help to control blood sugar levels and reduce the risk of long-term complications. Exercise can also help to reduce stress, which can help to improve overall health and wellbeing. When it comes to managing diabetes, diet is just one piece of the puzzle. It is important to work with a healthcare professional to create a plan that is tailored to your individual needs and lifestyle. With the right diet and lifestyle changes, managing diabetes can be much easier. Please support my work by upvoting this article, commenting below and sharing with your friends.

That scenario is going to create high anxiety for patients and their treating physician.

Full blood count A full blood count measures the number of red cells, white cells and platelets in your blood.Red cells carry oxygen around our bodies. Hemoglobin is the part of the cell that carries oxygen. If you have a low red cell count, your doctor might say you\u2019re anaemic . This can make you feel tired, short of breath and dizzy.White cells fight infections. There are several different types of white cells, including neutrophils and lymphocytes.Platelets help clot the blood. Symptoms of a low platelet count include abnormal bleeding, such as bleeding gums and nosebleeds.Urea and electrolytes These blood tests show how well your kidneys are working. Urea is a waste chemical produced from digesting protein. Our kidneys remove urea from the blood and get rid of it in the urine. Electrolytes are substances such as sodium, potassium, chloride and bicarbonate. Liver function tests (LFTs) Liver function tests check how well your liver is working. LFTs look for levels of enzymes and proteins made by the liver. They include:alanine aminotransferase (ALT)aspartate aminotransferase (AST)alkaline phosphatase (ALP)gamma-glutamyl transferase (Gamma GT)They might be raised if you have a blockage in your liver or bile duct, or if you drink a lot of alcohol. LFTs also look at the amount of bilirubin in the blood. This is a chemical in bile. Bilirubin can be raised if you have a problem with your liver or gallbladder. Bilirubin can cause yellowing of your skin and eyes (jaundice). And LFTs measure albumin. This is a protein that can be low in some types of cancer. You can also have low albumin if you\u2019ve been eating small amounts and are malnourished. Tumor markers blood test Tumor markers are substances that either the tumor or your body produces as a response to a cancer. They\u2019re usually proteins. Some tumor markers are only produced by one type of cancer. Others can be made by several types. Some markers are found in non cancerous conditions as well as cancer.

The question is, WHY would a doctor order any of these blood tests, other than a CBC, when cancer is not suspected or no specific malignancy is suspected? Understand that currently, most, if not all, of these tests, e.g. those for tumor markers, are generally specific and not necessarily sensitive. Please note that I acknowledge that as a Radiologist, I seldom was in a position to order blood tests (outside of a CBC and coagulation studies for Interventional Radiology procedures or renal function tests prior to administration of certain contrast materials,) though I have recommended a few (very few,) correlative blood tests after interpreting an imaging study, e.g. Pelvic Ultrasound, or CT/MRI of the liver.

What will happen is called an  Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_hemolytic_transfusion_reaction ]  (a medical emergency) whereby donor RBCs (A+) will get destroyed by host IgG and IgM antibodies. This triggers a systemic immune reaction where the alternative complement system is activated (I remember having the horror having to memorize this pathway in Immunology). As the cells are being lysed, macrophages move in to \"clean up\" the mess. Activated macrophages secrete a whole slew of cytokines which include TNF-alpha and the IL1 family of interleukins. These cytokines cause the release of Tissue Factor (TF) which triggers the extrinsic/intrinsic pathways of coagulation. This results in complications such as  Disseminated intravascular coagulation [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulation ]  (DIC); a condition which basically clogs up the blood vessels due to non-specific thrombin activation. PS: Thanks for the question. I haven't nerded out this hard in a while.   Update: To put this into laymen's terms: The ABO Blood type system classifies each type by antigens (an \"identifier\") presented on red blood cells. The A group has the A antigen, the B group has the B antigen, ABs have both, and Os have neither. In a person's blood, they also have antibodies  against  the opposing blood type. Antibodies attach to antigens on cells and mark them for destruction. As have anti-B antibodies, Bs have anti-A, AB has neither, and O has both. I'll skip Rh factors to simplify this discussion. If you transfuse an incompatible blood type, in this case, A+ blood into a B+ recipient, the anti-A antibodies in the recipient's body will attach to the donor's red blood cells and destroy them. The debris left over from dead cells (which now is in systemic circulation) will trigger systemic inflammation \u2014 it's as if you got a cut or bruise  everywhere inside your body  (since this process is  normal  for localized injury). This will cause your body to do what it does in the case of localized injury (like a cut on your finger) \u2014 clotting, recruitment of white blood cells, inflammation \u2014 except in the case, it happens  everywhere,  and this is what is known as disseminated intravascular coagulation.    Some have also asked about treatment and prognosis for people who receive the wrong transfusion. This depends on a number of factors:  * The most effective treatment is to stop the underlying cau...",
            "First, fever and joint pain. Then, circulatory collapse The blood agglutinates- sticks together- in clots when it is mixed with incompatible types. In a small amount, this is recoverable. In a larger amount, the result is fatal. As a nurse, it's really important that we prevent people receiving incompatible blood, and there are many different measures put into place to prevent, or respond to, incompatibility.",

I\u2019ve forgotten the drug - epinephrine perhaps. The nurse literally did not leave my side until all the symptoms abated. What I experienced was, I am told, a minor reaction. The reaction to an ABO or Rh incompatibility is supposed to be much, much worse."
