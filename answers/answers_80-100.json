            "my immediate response would be to focus on whatever bond and ideal my character hold erevan the half elf paladin of pelor would grasp the hilt and proclaim the strength of his conviction his devotion to protecting good and destroying evil is what push him reaching out to his god for aid he would imbue the blade with the holy light of pelor channel divinty sacred weapon and firmly pull iskandar the human barbarian would throw himself into a rage and wrench the blade with all his might his worth is his fury and strength a savagery that strike down whomever move against him and his ally rax the dragonborn battlemaster would flex his powerful arm and ask his friend to step back in case there might be some danger lurking his physical strength ha kept him alive but his companion have made that life worthwhile protection and compassion are his tenet and so he is worthy the best part of this encounter though would be the wide variety of good answer maybe two character choose to fight for the sword maybe the cleric reach out to her god for a divine demonstration of power or maybe the warlock consort with his patron to make a deal with whatever ha produced this voice there are so many good response i might have to steal this idea",
            "tbh depends on the type of personality you are playing with the character eg the joker type my respond ma dick etc the honourable knight might go on about his achievement arrogant people may say it their right to wield this blade etc the main thing i have learnt is expect anything but if you know your group very well and know how they are trying to play their character then you can probably make a good guess at their reaction",

            "4 assimovs writing ha extensive exploration of the three law being insufficient beyond hypothetical to assuage the fear of robot in men or to answer any the moral and ethical dilemma they present i feel like at least part of the point of it all wa that while the three law embodied good principal theyre too rigid in practice to actually be the basis of any sort of programmed behavior one of his story is about the second and third law contradicting each other and locking the robot in a loop another explores the duality of lying to spare people their feelingshurting them by not telling the truth others explore the way the law could inevitably be turned against people themselves because the point of the three laws isnt to provide an answer for people fear of machine it wa mostly fodder to create interesting and dramatic moral dilemma ie the three law are not a serious proposal for how we deal with this problem",

            "its impossible to shoot anything into the sun the way youd shoot an arrow into a target thats not how gravity work at all in order for something to intersect the sun it must fall into the sun the earth doe not fall into the sun because the earth ha a tangential component of velocity that is if you imagine a straight line connecting the earth to the sun at any given instant of time the earth is moving in the direction perpendicular to that straight line in order to drop something into the sun youd have to cancel out all of it velocity in that perpendicular direction so it essentially stationary in space relative to the sun gravity would then cause that something to fall straight into the sun rather than having it fall in an elliptical trajectory around the sun which is what an orbit is that mean accelerating an object from rest relative to the earth to about 70000 mile an hour again relative to the earth to bring it to a stop relative to the sun we have made thing that have ended up going that fast relative to the earth but weve never accelerated any manmade object to anything like a minute fraction of that speed weve gotten thing to go that fast by cheating using gravity in such a way that thing accelerate much faster than it possible for human being to accelerate them which of course would not work at all in this case so not only havent we shot anything into the sun but it practically impossible for that to happen it would require a rocket much bigger than anything we could or would build",
            "umm why would we need it to drop straight into the sun a spiral would be fine edit apparently they want to use venus this probe is designed to return to earth but the same idea should still be able to drop it into the sun",

            "but weve never accelerated any manmade object to anything like a minute fraction of that speed the orbital velocity of earth is 30 km to escape earths gravity you need 11 km  and we have achieved this already voyager i is going at about 17 km but a you say it slingshoted around several planet on the way out mars probe need a deltav of several km to just touch 15 au  and this is done without any interfering planet it may be a big push but it doesnt look like it that much beyond what we do fairly regularly",

            "thanks for being brave since it a close relative did you suppress your feeling and acted like nothing wrong happened or did you avoid talking to him all together i suppressed mine put them in a box in my head its like a pandora box now whenever i try to put more feeling in it i have to open the box and everything hit at once and it crippling i just cant move at time for hour do you feel this way too if yes how do you cope with it",
            "i wasnt sexually abused but physically mentally and emotionally it started when we were in middle school and he attempt to continue it today 20 year later he also claim to be the victim i no longer talk to him but he life with my parent so it really strained my relationship with them a well and prevented me from seeing them much i still have so much anger about the way he treated me and towards my parent for allowing it to happen lots of counseling ha helped but i feel the anger and resentment may always be there even though i want to forgive my parent and love them my anger ha turned inward and resulted in crippling depression and a nearly worthless selfview ill be restarting therapy soon a my depression ha become too much to bear i hope you find relief a well it wasnt your fault and you didnt deserve it no matter how he might try to manipulate the situation",
            "i wa sexually assaulted by a girl at a party when i wa black out drunk and whenever i tell people about it they make joke yes i know if i wa more sober i could have over powered her and no i wasnt lucky to have sex with her i guess the silver lining is i found out who my real friend were by how they reacted when i told them what happened"

            "im glad that this ha been resolved for now but i can see why it been flaired a ongoing rather than concluded the mil doesnt sound like the kind of person who going to be able to hold back on the control issue for long and i suspect that there are any number of boundary that she ha yet to violate",
            "mil clearly doe not understand where she is wrong this will not end well especially because oops husband doesnt really understand"
