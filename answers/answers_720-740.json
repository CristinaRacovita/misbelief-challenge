First, apparently NASA had a short-lived program to develop a space pen in the mid-1960s, but when the Fisher Company perfected their Space Pen, NASA bought a batch of them in time for the Apollo 7 first orbital mission in 1968.

First, apparently NASA had a short-lived program to develop a space pen in the mid-1960s, but when the Fisher Company perfected their Space Pen, NASA bought a batch of them in time for the Apollo 7 first orbital mission in 1968. I worked for NASA for 26 years, so let me assure you that at that time nobody was tracking what NASA spent inhouse. If NASA was developing the pen internally, it was by civil servants. NASA did not bookkeep civil servant salaries against programs or projects; they only started to do that in the early 2000s. If any financial records did exist, they would have covered procurements of materials or perhaps special equipment. These records would be unobtainable today. So NASA did neither \u201cinvented\u201d nor \u201cdeveloped\u201d the space pen. Neither did NASA invent nor develop these iconic products Kapton foil, Mylar foil, Tang, or Velcro. All these goods were developed by their manufacturers and then sold to NASA. The manufacturers then advertised NASA\u2019s purchase and use of them to promote their products. However, there are important products that NASA did develop, either directly inhouse or paid for others to develop. Did you ever hear of digital computers? GPS? Multilayer Insulation (MLI)? Forward osmosis membranes for water and chemical processing? Supercritical oxidation for water purification? Bio-diesel fuel from algae? Aerodynamic airfoils for wings and cowlings for aircraft engines? The swept wing on jet aircraft? . . . . Here is a short list of some more of such inventions: What Everyday Objects Were Invented for Astronauts? and another short one with only one repetition: Top 10 NASA Inventions and a longer one: Coolest NASA Discoveries That Changed Your Life So here is my question to you: Why do the people who ask these sub-trivial, repetitive questions about these de minimus issues when there are hundreds of actual NASA inventions that have had major impacts on all of our lives?",

It was enlightening. I wouldn\u2019t have fallen for a pencil, but there were some surprising Thou Shalt Nots that I wouldn\u2019t ever have considered. As a design engineer, you get away with a lot of things on the ground or in avionics because the users are not (typically, anyway) in a sealed atmospheric system, and you have gravity to move things to the footwells, eventually. Not so much in a spacecraft. You have to assume that anything that can come loose from your design, from outgassing to particulates, is going into an astronaut\u2019s lungs or into an electronics bay or some sort of mechanical pivot at some point. And so we come to the Russian \u201ccommon sense\u201d pencil solution. They actually used Fisher pens as well, but let\u2019s ignore that. Pencils work by abrading graphite against paper. Some of the graphite stays embedded in the paper. But most of it is deposited ON the paper, ready to spread around at a moment\u2019s notice, or comes loose in somewhat larger fragments scattered on the paper\u2019s surface, which is why draftsmen using pencils have ways of removing the loose bits so the paper doesn\u2019t end up smudged later. But in space, it doesn\u2019t conveniently stay put for your eraser bag and drawing brush to carry away. It takes off into the cabin, where it ends up in an astronaut\u2019s lungs or in an electronics bay, or in some sort of moving part. And graphite is conductive. It also has a propensity to interact with lubricants and become a sort of immobile sludge. So while Joe Sixpack might guffaw at the stupid scientists and engineers who should have used a pencil, HAW HAW! but in reality it\u2019s an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Joe thinks of the inside of the spacecraft like his desk at work. Pencils work just fine! They should have used one! HAW HAW! But in space, it DOESN\u2019T work just fine, and Joe\u2019s mistake is trying to extrapolate his home environment experience into a place that it\u2019s not relevant.",

A Sheaffer Fineline at the time cost about $1.75. Fisher thought they could make money by selling the pens to the general public, and they were correct. Besides the cachet of people owning a \u201cspace pen\u201d, the pens write well in lots of places where ordinary pens don\u2019t.

Of course, it was nice to be able to imply in advertisements that the astronauts used the pens.The idea that NASA should have just used pencils is naive. While a pencil works fine in zero gravity, it also sheds graphite dust, which can be dangerous in zero-G, and the wood in pencils is flammable. The space pens were a much better solution, and NASA actually paid less for them than for some of the mechanical pencils they tried.

Look for red-labeled items in NASA videos... if you find them, you'll know that I was there. The Fisher Space Pen is a well-known writing utensil on the International Space Station (ISS) as well as basic mechanical pencils (with a very thick lead). The mechanical pencils are typically used by the crew to write in numerical values necessary to execute on board procedures (burn times, engine configurations, etc.). The ability to erase something in your procedures is an excellent capability to have, especially if situations change, which they often do. However, as thick as the lead is (thicker than No. 2), it still may break, creating unwanted pieces of \"stuff\" floating in the ISS zero-g environment... something you don't want to get in your eyes. The filter system however, does a pretty good job of quickly pulling that type of stuff out of the mainstream airflow. Grease pencils, while available, are seldom used, at least to my knowledge. There's an old joke out there that tells how the United States spent thousands of dollars to develop the Fisher Space Pen (they didn\u2019t, Paul C. Fisher did, and then NASA adopted them for use in space), specifically to be used by astronauts to write in zero-gravity. Its fancy design allows ink to be pumped to the writing element and surface, enabling a person to write in any orientation. The Russians? Well, now, they just used a pencil! Keep lookin' up!",

If I did, the answer is yes, but not for the reasons you think. The ISS creates no perceivable gravitational force to \"pull\" an astronaut closer as our questioner suggests. It's done with something mechanical, more akin to a fishing reel! Every very time an astronaut is required to leave the cozy and quite comfy interior of the ISS to perform a spacewalk, many precautions are taken to ensure that astronaut's safety. The suit is methodically checked and rechecked, as are all the tools and gear that will be used once our \"handyman\" is outside. First and foremost in that gear check will be the unit we astronauts refer to as our safety tether.Exiting the airlock by opening the thermal cover. Earth is toward my head! A tremendously clever piece of engineering, the safety tether consists of two hooks --one large, one small-- connected by straps of spacesuit-like material on each end of a \"reel\" device that I liken to those used on fishing poles. This reel typically contains 85' of thin, braided cable wire, which can be extended automatically as the astronaut moves away from his ISS exit point, known as the airlock hatch.Astronauts rotate their body upon exiting the airlock, their feet eventually pointing in the direction of Earth (top of picture). Note the tether reels affixed to tether points near the module's surface by my gloves. Once exited from the airlock opening, the first thing the spacewalker is required to do is attach the large hook of the safety tether to a specific tether point just outside the hatch. The smaller hook, affixed to the astronaut's spacesuit while they were still safely inside, will remain there... UNLESS the astronaut has to do a \"tether swap\" at some point during the EVA. While 85' of cable may seem more than long enough (in the shuttle days, these tethers were a mere 55' in length, and we still use those on station if needed), the ISS is the size of an American Football field or World Cup Soccer pitch, so oftentimes, as we move to a point 85' away, more than one tether is required. Hence, a tether swap (to a second tether; 85' or 55') is performed. Think of Tarzan, swinging beneath his jungle canopy, moving from vine-to-vine to allow himself to move further away from his original tree top! We just have to be a lot more careful during our \"swaps\" than he is!Now these tether reels retract, and/or \"hold\" the cable, automatically --kind of like the seatbelts in our cars. And, since the micro-gravity (weightlessness) of space doesn't need much force to \"pull\" you around, slow, deliberate movements --of an amount of force larger than the cable's \"pull\"-- let you move further away, correspondingly extending the cable wire from the reel. The theory is, if you were to just let go, the reel's force would pull you back to wherever it is anchored, typically at the airlock(if you are only using one). If you use multiple tethers during your spacewalk, the reel pulls you to the point where you swapped tethers. Of course additional, smaller, non-retractable tethers are also part of an astronaut's tool belt. These versions, referred to as \"local\" tethers, provide an additional level of protection above and beyond the safety tethers. As an astronaut moves to a new worksite, and is ready to stay there for awhile, it is imperative that local tethers are affixed immediately, for redundancy, ensuring our hero won't be going anywhere, no matter what happens! Keep lookin' up!",
            "Nope. But they already found away to create gravitic simulation, through spin. (that\u2019s actually old already) The only reason we don\u2019t have any such space station already, is because of the size of the space station, which would have to be like 100m in size for such spin to allow for gravity simulation. I already described such a space station at one time or another somewhere, with a building method, involving 3D printing of sorts, using mostly carbon fibre. It\u2019s lightweight, for most of the structure, and allows for an inside sphere where working to build it\u2019s infrastructure last.",
            "Is artificial gravity possible in space? There are two different ways that we currently have to simulate gravity in a spacecraft we could build.

There are two different ways that we currently have to simulate gravity in a spacecraft we could build. The first and most straight forward technique is to simply accelerate your craft in the direction of travel at the a rate that gives you the effect you require. This has the advantage of simplicity, since you merely build your craft as though it\u2019s always sitting on the launch pad, and only ever experience zero G at the halfway point of your voyage when you spin it around 180 degrees and start an equal deceleration burn so that you arrive at you destination at a nice orbital velocity. There is only one small problem with this simple and elegant solution, and that\u2019s the fact that we have no drive system remotely capable of giving a significant acceleration effect over anything other than extremely short distances. Interplanetary travel using this method is totally out of the question until we create something that\u2019s several orders of magnitude more effective than anything on the drawing boards. (If we had such a drive system available, we\u2019d also be able to obtain speeds up to a serious fraction of lightspeed, which would be awesome) That leaves the second option as the only workable solution, where the acceleration effect is not supplied by the drive system, but rather by a rotational vector that allows a gravity equivalent to be experienced on the outer walls of the vessel. This too is a simple solution, but it does have some issues inherent in the concept. When you use centripedal acceleration as a means to simulate normal gravity, you are committed to building a substantial structure in order to avoid negative effects such as differing \u201cG\u201d forces at different distance from the centre of rotation and the application of coriolis forces on the objects inside. Studies have shown that anything with a radius of less than 100m or a speed of more than 3 rpm produces significant motion sickness that debilitates most people. If the craft has a radius greater than 500m, or a rotational speed of less than 1 rpm, then most people are perfectly comfortable as the adverse variable \u201cG\u201d and coriolis effects are diffuse enough by then. This rather hampers your design if you wanted to get somewhere quickly without truly stupendous engines as your craft is now at least 1km in diameter and weighs thousands of tonnes. It is however quite viable if you were in no hurry or just wanted an orbital habitat that looked something like this.You wouldn\u2019t want to build something like this however,The cleaning bill would be horrendous, and your astronauts would not be very useful given that they\u2019d spend most of their time head down in the toilet. A useful equation is the following;This is the formula used to calculate how large the vessel must be, and how fast it must spin in order to achieve the desired gravity. T = time period taken for one complete revolution, R = radius of the rotating section of the spacecraft, and a = the acceleration generated (9.8 m/s2 equals 1G). There is another way to achieve rotational gravity without building immense structures, and that\u2019s to use conventional space craft coupled together by either a truss or cable, and \u201cspin them up\u201d in order to provide the same effect as an enormous wheel or cylinder. You end up with something that looks like this;It may not look pretty, but it does give artificial gravity without outrageous amounts of mass. It may be a little unwieldy in terms of course corrections and navigation, but I can see a design where control thrusters and navigation sensors are sited at the \u201chub\u201d, and use a computer to compensate for the rotational speed. Until we invent some as yet mythical drive that has a specific impulse in the millions of seconds instead of merely the hundreds of seconds, it looks as though spinning things up is the only practical way to go.",

Artificial gravity levels vary proportionately with the distance from the centre of rotation. With a small radius of rotation, the amount of gravity felt at one's head would be significantly different from the amount felt at one's feet. This could make movement and changing body position awkward. In accordance with the physics involved, slower rotations or larger rotational radii would reduce or eliminate this problem, per Newton's Third LawThe Coriolis effect gives an apparent force that acts on objects that move relative to a rotating reference frame. This apparent force acts at right angles to the motion and the rotation axis and tends to curve the motion in the opposite sense to the habitat's spin. If an astronaut inside a rotating artificial gravity environment moves towards or away from the axis of rotation, he will feel a force pushing him towards or away from the direction of spin. These forces act on the inner ear and can cause dizziness, nausea and disorientation. Lengthening the period of rotation (slower spin rate) reduces the Coriolis force and its effects. It is generally believed that at 2 rpm or less, no adverse effects from the Coriolis forces will occur; at higher rates some people can become accustomed to it and some do not; but at rates above 7 rpm few if any can become accustomed.[5] It is not yet known if very long exposures to high levels of Coriolis forces can increase the likelihood of becoming accustomed. The nausea-inducing effects of Coriolis forces can also be mitigated by restraining movement of the head.",

Secondly, in astronomy, the brightness of a celestial body, or magnitude as it is called, refers to its visibility either; (a) from earth, known as apparent magnitude, or (b) if placed a standard distance of 32.6 Ly equivalent to 10 parsecs away, otherwise known as absolute magnitude. Luminosity is the measure of the amount of light energy (or power emitted by photons) that a star outputs. In terms of values, brightness and magnitude have an inverse relation,i.e. the brighter the body, the lower its magnitude value. Our Sun has the highest apparent magnitude, -26.72, being that it is the brightest object from earth. Pluto has an apparent magnitude of 13.65. Very faint. Having said that, most of the answers here regard the Large Magellanic Cloud resident R136a1[1] as the brightest star. R136a1 has an apparent magnitude of 12.23, which is how we see it from earth, its pretty faint. The question however was not referring to brightness as seen from the earth or apparent brightness in this case. Its brightness from the standard distance of 10 parsecs, absolute magnitude, is -8.09. Now that\u2019s bright! Our sun\u2019s absolute magnitude is a faint 4.2. If the Sun was replaced by R136a1, its apparent magnitude would be a blinding -39. However, its not bright enough. My vote goes to Rho Cassiopeiae[2], a rare yellow hyper-giant in the constellation Cassiopeia. It has an average absolute magnitude of -9.5! I say average because unlike R136a1, Rho changes its magnitude overtime. It is a pulsating, unstable star, losing mass approximately every 50 years. During these events of mass loss, it sheds a fraction of its atmosphere to solar winds and pulsates, causing its brightness to rise and fall by a magnitude of about 1.5. Unlike R136a1, Rho Cassiopeiae is visible to the naked eye. Fun fact:The binary Star system Adhara in the constellation Canis Majors, has the record for the brightest star ever when about 4.7 million years ago, it was located only 34 Ly from the sun and had an absolute magnitude of -3.99. It will continue bearing this record for another 5 million years. It main star currently has an absolute magnitude of 1.5 and its companion 1.9.Footnotes[1] R136a1[2] Rho Cassiopeiae - Wikipedia",

And honestly, it\u2019s probably not going to change because most middle and high schools don\u2019t have dedicated astronomy courses, but only vaguely touch on the subject in only one or two chapters of a general science textbook. Therefore, many things have to be oversimplified, which has the unfortunate effect of causing great misunderstanding. Here are just a few astronomy misconceptions:\u201cThe planets of our Solar System orbit the Sun.\u201d Not exactly. While they may appear to be orbiting the Sun, they\u2019re actually orbiting around the Solar System\u2019s shared centre of mass (barycentre), which is oftentimes outside of the Sun and sometimes inside the Sun, but almost never at the exact centre of the Sun. Here, the red lines show how the Solar System\u2019s barycentre has changed over the past 80 years, relative to the size of the sun:Even the Sun itself orbits the Solar System\u2019s barycentre, causing it to wobble.\u201cThe Moon has no atmosphere.\u201d Almost. While, for the purposes of high school curriculum, knowing that the Moon has an atmosphere unnecessarily complicates the lecture, it\u2019s not true at all. The Moon\u2019s atmosphere is very, very thin and it\u2019s composed primarily of potassium, sodium, helium, and argon\u2014 but just because it\u2019s very thin doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not there.\u201cThe North Star (Polaris) is the brightest star in the night sky.\u201d Not even close. The brightest star in the night sky is actually Sirius A. In fact, here\u2019s a quick list of the brightest stars of the night sky:Sirius ACanopusAlpha Centauri A & B (actually two stars, but when viewed from Earth appears as a single star)ArcturusVegaCapellaRigel (not to be confused with Rigel Kentaurus, which is the other name for Alpha Centauri A)ProcyonAchernarHadarAnd those are just the ones that I remember. This list goes on and on and on, and you won\u2019t find Polaris until around #50 or so. For this reason, you can\u2019t find Polaris just by looking for the brightest stars in the sky. If you were a sailor in the 18th century employing this flawed method, you\u2019d be hopelessly lost. To find Polaris, you must look at the constellations\u2014 find the Big Dipper, look above the pan for the Little Dipper, and you\u2019ll find Polaris at the end of its handle. If you find Cassiopeia instead, you\u2019ve looked too far up. But if you\u2019re living in the Southern Hemisphere, you won\u2019t find Polaris no matter how hard you look. If you\u2019re using the night sky to navigate, you\u2019ll want to look for the constellation Crux (the Southern Cross), which is literally just four stars in the shape of a cross or kite.",

Notice too the nucleus doesn\u2019t have a distinct set of protons and neutrons. I distinctly remember getting to Grade 12 chemistry and realizing everything I had been taught about atoms my whole life to that point had been a lie. After this, you start getting into quantum phenomenon which means it\u2019s impossible to determine the precise position and momentum of individual electrons.

They have one hump. DromedaryThe dromedary (pronounced /\u02c8dr\u0251m\u0259d\u025b\u0279i/ or /\u02c8dr\u0252m\u0259dri/) also called the Arabian camel or the Indian Camel (Camelus dromedarius) is a large, even-toed ungulate with one hump on its back.Dromedaries are used as beasts of burden in most of their domesticated range. Unlike horses, they kneel for the loading of passengers and cargo. It has been estimated that a camel can carry 159\u2013295 kg (350\u2013650 lb) for 24 km (15 mi) for a long time. Camels can be trained to bear loads from five years of age, but must not be given a large load until six years old. It has been found that camels are patient animals, easier to train and tougher than cattle. Camels can also be used to pull carts, plow and draw wheels. A dromedary can plow at a speed of 2.5 km (1.6 mi) per hour, but must not be worked for more than six hours a day. Their hair is durable and light, so it is used as a source material for woven goods, ranging from Bedouin tents to garments. The hair is clipped off using hand shears, or sometimes simply pulled, after which the camel's body is oiled. Juveniles less than two years of age have a fine undercoat, which is also used for these purposes. They also give wool. The wool produce of a herd of 4300 dromedaries in Russia in 1970 and 1974 was 557 kg (1,230 lb) and 576 kg (1,270 lb) respectively.[54]",

Cold-Resistant Feet: Ducks have a counter-current heat exchange system in their legs that helps them retain warmth in cold water, preventing heat loss through their feet. 4. Monogamy and Homosexuality: Some duck species are known for forming monogamous pairs during mating season, but interestingly, there are documented cases of homosexual behavior in ducks. 5. Sleep with One Eye Open: Ducks can sleep with one eye open, which allows them to be alert to potential threats even while resting. 6. No Echo Quack: A popular myth suggests that a duck's quack doesn't echo. This myth has been debunked; duck quacks can indeed echo. 7. Diverse Species: Ducks are incredibly diverse, with over 120 different species, ranging from tiny teals to large mallards, each with unique adaptations and behaviors. 8. Excellent Divers: Many duck species are excellent divers and can stay underwater for extended periods. The common eider, for example, can dive to great depths in search of food. 9. Green Heads: Male mallards have iridescent green heads, which are used for attracting females. The brighter the green, the healthier and more attractive the male is considered. Ducks often use their quacking sounds to communicate, but they can also use echoes to determine the location and distance of objects. These facts highlight the remarkable and often surprising characteristics of these waterfowl.",

This radiation allows for radio signals, cellphone signals, WiFi signals, microwave ovens, light visible to our eyes, x-rays, as well as the gamma radiation we encounter with nuclear weapons. That\u2019s the easy answer\u2026and an explanation that the typical incurious person will readily accept. Since you seem curious, let me begin with this quick overview of electromagnetism: According to electromagnetic theory, the presence of an electrical field requires the existence of a charged particle. If the charge of an object flips (or even changes slightly) it\u2019s polarity (positive to negative, negative to positive, half-negative to quarter-negative), a magnetic field of proportional frequency and strength will result. Electromagnetic radiation (AKA light) possesses both fields, and by understanding how an oscillating electric field produces a magnetic field, the nature of light should be relatively easy to understand. If you\u2019re wondering WHAT is oscillating to produce this electromagnetic phenomenon in light, we need to dive a bit deeper. Considering that all atoms contain positively-charged protons and negatively-charged electrons, it\u2019s reasonable to ask if light is just the result of a negatively-charged electron turning into a positively-charged proton. After all, according to the Standard Model, the photon (AKA light) is believed to be the force mediator of the electromagnetic field; it is the particle which physically bonds an electron to a proton. According to this model, protons and electrons are essentially engaged in game of tennis where the photon unites them in a common cause. It would be nice if this anthropomorphic analogy held up under under all current theories of physics, but it does not. According to Einstein\u2019s Relativity, no object with mass can travel at the speed of light. Electrons and protons both possess mass, so it\u2019s not possible that THEY are the oscillating particles in light that are traveling AT the speed of light. So if not electrons or protons, what is the source of charge for light\u2019s electrical field? This is where it gets deep and purely theoretical. What does an object experience when it travels at the speed of light? If Relativity is correct, the faster an object travels through space, the slower it travels through time (and visa versa). Think about that for a second because it\u2019s potentially one of the most profound observations of reality you will ever encounter. If correct, an object which travels through space at space-time\u2019s speed limit must necessarily not experience time. If an object does not experience time, it must be able to exist in all of space without any spatial constraints. Therefore, a single photon should be able to exist at any point of space in the universe without violating the currently-understood laws of space-time physics. For some reason, I want to believe that the size of the observable universe suggests it\u2019s comprised of more than just a single photon acting omnipresntly, and that the structure of the universe is more likely the result of a composite fabric of bosonic strings (of which light is a member) perturbed by fluxes of internal energy (see Bosonic String Theory). However, it\u2019s hard for me to fully fathom the abilities of a particle which does not experience time. Therefore, I cannot fully give you an answer to your question of \u201cWhat is light?\u201d It could potentially be everything; then again, it might be just what current physcisicist suggest it is: a funadamentally unexplainable phenomenon that must be accepted for how we believe it behaves.",

Where it's famously said light is both 'bullets and waves' at the same time. Which is actually wrong. What physicists really mean is that light is neighter like a bullet nor a wave . Its unlike anything you have ever seen before. It's screwy. But there is a good news. Electrons are also screwy but in the same way as light. And so are all the other particles in the universe. Alas, light is no different than the particles that compose you! All are screwy and weird but in the same way. Makes you wonder why, then other particles can't travel at light speeds, but light can. And that question would eventually take you to the concept of Higgs field and the whole definition of 'mass' is questioned. Let me know if you are interested.",

Electromagnetic radiation can also be described in terms of a stream of photons which are massless particles each travelling with wavelike properties at the speed of light. A photon is the smallest quantity (quantum) of energy which can be transported and it was the realization that light travelled in discrete quanta that was the origins of Quantum Theory. It is no accident that humans can \u2018see\u2019 light. The detection of light is a very powerful tool for probing the universe around us. As light interacts with matter it can be become altered and by studying light that has originated or interacted with matter, many of the properties of that matter can be determined. It is through the study of light that for example we can understand the composition of the stars light years away or watch the processes that occur in the living cell as they happen Matter is composed of atoms, ions or molecules and it is light\u2019s interaction with matter which gives rise to the various phenomena which can help us understand the nature of matter. The atoms, ions or molecules have defined energy levels usually associated with energy levels that electrons in the matter can hold. Light can be generated by the matter or a photon of light can interact with the energy levels in a number of ways. We can represent the energy levels in a diagram known as a Jablonski diagram. An example of one is shown in the diagram above. An atom or molecule in the lowest energy state possible known as the ground state can absorb a photon which will allow the atom or molecule to be raised to a higher energy level state or become excited. Hence the matter can absorb light of characteristic wavelengths such as the blue light in the example on the right or the violet light in the example on the left. The atom or molecule won't stay in an excited state so it relaxes back to the ground state by several ways. In the example on the right, the atom or molecule emits two photons both of lower energy than the absorbed photon. The photons emitted will be a characteristic energy appropriate for a particular atom or compound and so by studying the light emission the matter under investigation can be determined. In the example on the left the excited atom or molecule initially loses energy by not emitting a photon and instead relaxes to the lower energy state by internal processes which typically heat up the matter. The intermediate energy level then relaxes to the ground state by the emission of a photon of orange",

These characteristics vary according to mass/energy and in light\u2019s case just energy (because light particles are mass-less) These two behaviors can be understood through the success of many experiments like the Photoelectric Effect Experiment (supports particle theory), Young\u2019s Double Slit Experiment (supports wave theory), etc. Even though all wavelengths and frequencies of light exhibit this duality, it is easier to treat the longer wavelengths more as waves because of their low energies and at the same time, it is easier to treat shorter wavelengths as particles because of their high energies (energies that can have noticeable effects macroscopic-ally). You can also read this answer and get further insight into this duality through the case of a neutron being a wave. Sumedh Rathi's answer to What is neutron diffraction?",

Bonus: This substitution could help you be less surprised when field quanta behave in interesting ways, like tunneling through potentials that a classical particle wouldn't be able to pass through. That's a property of field quanta, and suddenly you know a tiny bit more about what defines them, instead of being confused because \"solid balls pass through walls,\" which is not correct. So, the particles commonly called photons are field quanta of the EM-field. They sometimes appear localized and sometimes non-localized. Or in other terms, sometimes they are particle-like (in the classical particle sense) and sometimes wave-like. Note that the \"appear\" and \"-like\" parts are important. One could even model them like waves sometimes and like classical particles other times, but each such model will ultimately fail to describe photons in all contexts. Off-topic, though useful when thinking about QM, the following article describes a useful approach to physics:Think Like Reality Short excerpt:Reality has been around since long before you showed up.  Don't go calling it nasty names like \"bizarre\" or \"incredible\".  The universe was propagating complex amplitudes through configuration space for ten billion years before life ever emerged on Earth.  Quantum physics is not \"weird\".  You are weird.  You have the absolutely bizarre idea that reality ought to consist of little billiard balls bopping around, when in fact reality is a perfectly normal cloud of complex amplitude in configuration space.  This is your problem, not reality's, and you are the one who needs to change."

Being curious creates a mindset of openness which will serve you over and over in this process. When we understand addiction as any behavior that gives temporary relief, temporary pleasure, is eventually craved, but in the long term results in negative consequences that are potentially harmful, and despite those consequences you can\u2019t give up the behavior, it\u2019s easy to see that addiction doesn\u2019t start as a problem. Addiction starts with a behavior that solves a problem. Slowly, the substance or behavior becomes prioritized. In little (and eventually big) ways, life orients around the substance or behavior. Other priorities fall by the way side. The brain and nervous system releases certain brain chemicals in response to the addictive substance or behavior, which elevate mood and relieve pain. The individual becomes attached to these sensations, which are very powerful. Why not \u2026 they feel good, lift anxiety and can give us a sense of being alive. There\u2019s too many examples, but here\u2019s some common ones:Relieves stress: 2-3 drinks (hits, lines, pills, etc) brings relief that allows one to temporarily numb out any stressor.Relieves anxiety: uncomfortable interactions are soothed with social lubricants of drugs or alcohol.Relieves pain: legitimate physical (or emotional pain) is temporarily relieved with drugs or alcohol.The problem arises when we begin to confuse these feelings with love and life, and we lose other ways of relieving stress or feeling good. Having a quick euphoric solution to uncomfortable feelings is great, but at some point the same behavior/amount doesn\u2019t bring the desired result. In the brain, natural brain chemicals designed to bring relief to a person, can\u2019t compete with the consistent surges of brain chemicals from the 2-3 drinks (hits, lines, pills, etc). More of the substance or process is needed to get the desired feelings (tolerance). So, natural brain chemical production shuts down - no other quick strategies bring relief. What started as a strategy to get pleasure or relief turns into a dependency. Whether you see addiction as a disease or not, matters less then knowing brain chemicals become unbalanced and change mood - and most importantly - the individual will not recognize the problem. Why? Because the brain has been conditioned to loop back and attempt to get the same original euphoria. The internal self-talk messaging starts as: That feels good. Remember that. Do that again. Over time, it morphs into: Remember that. Do it again. Later, it becomes: Do it again. Do it again. Do it again. Although the brain remembers the original high, it is never again achieved, unless a stronger drug is found. Thinking and beliefs are changed by these brain changes. The flood of stress hormones in the brain, like cortisol, push neurotransmitters that make brain chemicals out of balance. Using a substance over and over fires neurotransmitters, which eventually become out of balance. Below is a list of the 4 main neurotransmitter systems and potential symptoms of that neurotransmitter being out of balance.Low serotonin: You\u2019re negative, obsessive, worried, irritable and sleeplessLow catecholamines: You\u2019ve crashed and can sink in to a lethargic funkLow Gaba: You\u2019re wired, stressed, and overwhelmedLow endorphins: You\u2019re crying during commercials and overly sensitive to hurtThe brain finds a way to feel better based on the specific brain imbalance. Low serotonin brains will gravitate towards: alcohol, marijuana, MDMA, calming drugs Low catecholamine brains will gravitate towards: alcohol, marijuana, meth, cocaine Low gaba brains will gravitate towards: alcohol, marijuana, xanax (benzos) Low endorphin brains will gravitate towards: alcohol, marijuana, heroine (opiates) Actually, there\u2019s a lot more going on. But the above are examples to help understand what happens in the human brain in the process towards addiction.",

Basically, if you find pleasure in doing something and you believe that only that thing alone can make you forget your worries and mishaps that you have had in your life, then you will keep doing it, regardless of whatever consequences it might bring. It will soon lead you to believe that whatever you are doing is beneficial to you, because you, ultimately desire happiness, and your brain is releasing dopamine telling you that you have achieved your goal, you are happy at that point of time. However, as soon as you stop doing that, you fall back into misery and crave doing it again, because your brain just keeps giving you a false sense of hope that whatever you are doing will make you happy, again, leaving out the fact that you will feel the same misery as soon as you stop. The vicious cycle then continues, again and again. During the Vietnam War, many American troops and soldiers were deployed into Vietnam to fight the war, meaning that the conditions for them were undesirable and of course, there were not much entertainment for them. They missed their families back home, were fighting for a foreign land far away from what they were familiar with, and lived in constant fear. Hence, they turned to drugs, to find at least a few moments worth of peace and happiness. When the war ended and those who survived could return back to their homelands, many citizens in America were afraid that once they returned they would continue the same habits of turning to drugs and being addicted to them, causing their country to fall apart. However, it was not the case. Once they could return, they were back with their families, no longer feared death nor war, and they had lots of things to occupy their leisure times with. Because of all the other simple objects and activities in their lives that give them happiness and pleasure, they no longer sought happiness from drugs, and addiction was a thing of their past. In our society, instead of criticizing people for their pointless addictions in your eyes, find out why they have to do it, (are they distressed from losing a loved one, or do they feel utterly alone with no one to confide to in this world) and find out what they find unbearable in their lives, and you can potentially help them free themselves from the chains that they have once thought they would never be able to break away from, because addicts did not ever want to be addicts in the first place.",

They're the sleuths of history, solving mysteries that have long been forgotten, obscured by the sands of time. Both archaeologists and historians are armed with a variety of tools and methods to uncover the truth. The former excavate the earth, unearthing relics and remains that hold clues to civilizations that once thrived. They meticulously sift through layers of soil, sifting out the evidence to rebuild ancient worlds brick by brick. Like a seasoned gumshoe, they analyze every artifact, scrutinizing pottery shards, bones, and ruins, searching for patterns and connections that reveal the untold stories of long-lost societies. Historians, on the other hand, are akin to detectives who meticulously comb through old records and dusty manuscripts. They scrutinize every document, every primary source, with a discerning eye, looking for clues that will help them reconstruct a more accurate account of the past. They cross-examine witnesses from different times and places, reading between the lines to discern the motives, biases, and hidden truths in the accounts left by those who came before. Both professions are driven by an insatiable curiosity and a relentless pursuit of the truth. They're adept at connecting the dots, deciphering hidden meanings, and recognizing patterns that the untrained eye might miss. They understand that history, much like a noir mystery, is full of secrets, twists, and red herrings, and it takes a keen intellect and unwavering dedication to untangle the web of events that have shaped human history. So, as archaeologists and historians slip into the shadows of the past, they embrace the role of the detective, fully aware that the truth is often buried beneath layers of myth, legend, and misinformation. But with persistence, patience, and a little bit of luck, they know they can unlock the secrets of the past, just like a hardboiled private eye cracking the case wide open.",

Whenever a small section of a site requires to be excavated it is first necessary to ensure that the current condition of the section is mapped out by drawing it on graph paper. Just like one practiced doing in Arch school. Having a panic attack at such times is not advisable but help may be at hand provided one maintains their focus? Colleagues do tend to be quite helpful though it is best to remember that helping other people is a two way street rather than all take, take, take. Archaeology sites can vary considerably relating to the natural geography and any subsequent man made alterations on adjoining land which may have affected drainage and not always positively. Both wet and dry clay soils are an absolute nightmare to dig. While excavating during a downpour is pretty pointless given the loss of features within the soil.

Federal highways, airports, oil/gas pipelines, even cell towers -- all of these involve federal money, and hence, they require archaeological surveys. The feds can't do all this work on their own, so private companies -- CRM firms -- developed. CRM, as David said, is not glamorous work. However, it is very interesting and is a great career if you enjoy doing manual labor while also having to employ lots of diverse analytical skills. I fell in love with archaeology because of this. The good parts of being a working archaeologist are as follows:- everyone is inherently interested in what you do. I've had more than one person buy my drinks at the bar in exchange for telling them tales from the field. I never come home at the end of the day wondering why I'm doing what I'm doing.- even on days when you don't find anything, you've still gotten paid to hike, often in some really cool places (particularly in the Southwest, where I work).- you get to travel. A lot.- it's never mindnumbingly boring. In a given day, you may have to figure out how best to access a slot canyon, determine the boundaries of an archaeological site, write up a site assessment report, use a variety of cool devices, and coordinate with a variety of other folks who also have cool jobs (e.g. biologists, paleontologists, engineers, etc.). I've also gotten to ride in helicopters, airboats (in Louisiana) and four-wheelers, all as part of my job. The bad parts are as follows:- fieldwork is a young man's/woman's game. I'm 34 and am getting to the point where I'm tired of living in hotels. It's also damn near impossible to be a field archaeologist and maintain relationships.- sometimes the projects are simply difficult. I worked in the southern California desert (Blythe) a couple summers ago. It was 120 degrees in the middle of the day, and, long story short, I knew we weren't going to find any archaeological sites on that project. (That said, I was making over $220/day for the inconvenience -- not bad.)- most CRM jobs are temporary. That means you're working on a single project for weeks or months, then you get laid off. Also, you can't dig in the snow, so fieldwork winds down in most states around October. Most people I know who do this either get on unemployment during the off-months (and then travel abroad -- not a bad life) or else pick up temporary winter jobs (I've known a few ski instructors who also do CRM).",

I know of several locations where digs must be kept secret to prevent plundering, or sites where looting has destroyed one of a kind evidence in the search of treasure. And when an artifact is looted and sold, it is usually kept from the public eye where it may provide important information.  I think looters are the scum of the Earth, and those who purchase unauthorized antiquities are no better. The most famous recent example is the James Ossuary, which has been controversial since it first appeared.  Since there is no reference to where or how it was found, the dark cloud of doubt will always hang over the object. In Israel's James Ossuary forgery trial, science was the loser 2.  Too many parties have agendas that force them to mis-interpret data, or deny it altogether.  Mistakes or contradictions in data are seen as failings in the field, with religion and politics constantly pitching in to the debate, usually to muddy any conclusions that may prove to be inconvenient or uncomfortable.  This can be seen in the Middle East where tensions are high between Israel and the Muslim countries who will do anything to hide or deny archaeological proof of Jewish historical claims in the region.  Another example is the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan by the Taliban. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12674541 3.  Today's technology is a wonderful tool.  Information can be gleaned from such things as satellite imaging and ground penetration radar.  In many cases, features and details can be identified without ever needing to put shovel to dirt, things that may not have been discovered during excavations. 4.  A century ago, archaeology was about the gold, silver and glory. Many of the things found in places like Egypt, Mespotamia, Greece and the Americas were taken to the finders country of origin.  Some of these were tantamount to outright vandalism and theft, such as the Elgin Marbles.  Egyptian mummies were so numerous, they were used as fuel for locomotives.  Today, Archaeology is about treasures and glory still, but the treasures and the glory have changed.  Burials of the royal and nobility are still exciting, but more mundane discoveries are just as important, and sometimes more exciting.  The focus has become more about the daily lives of the common person, rather than the how sparkly their kings were. 5.  When I was much younger, I had volunteered at a local excavation.  It lasted 2 summers, and I rode my bike about 10 miles one way each day for 5 weeks to get to the site.  A few years back, I wanted to have my daughters experience the same with me.  They were under 16 at the time.  Now, most sites won't allow volunteers under the age of 16, even with a parent.  So caution and fear of liability have denied younger enthusiasts the chance to participate directly in the activity.  This is unfortunate, since excavations are the first step to understanding the field.  It's hard to understand the setting of some artifacts and the process of determining what they mean without that experience. Finally, if archaeology interests you, think about what is involved.  Like any science, it is all about the collection and interpretation of data.  Working on digs may sound exciting, but those really standout  finds are few and far between.  Then, whatever you find gets boxed up and shipped out for other archaeologists, anthropologists, historians and various other scientists to digest.  Sometimes things get locked away for years until someone decides to take a second look at them.  There is also the matter of funding, and many archaeologists spend most of their time finding money to support their research. Characters like Indiana Jones are anachronisms, glamorizing the field with swashbuckling exploits and fighting off swarms of natives.  This image dates back to the days of Giovanni Belzoni and Heinrich Schliemann.  This isn't to say the field archaeologist isn't brave or glamorous in their own right.  Many excavations are under constant threat by civil instability, Looters or even natural forces. http://library.thinkquest.org/J001645/mid.shtml If archaeology interests you, try finding a local dig where you can volunteer.  You can always contact any local historical society, natural history museum or university to see if there is something you can get involved in. If you check out magazines like Biblical Archaeological Review or Archaeology, they usually have opportunities to volunteer at more distant excavations (you pay your way, but BAR has an annual scholarship for just such a trip). You will probably be involved in mostly manual labor, digging, sifting and schlepping, but you might also be invited to sit in on discussions and lessons.  And many famous discoveries have been attributed to volunteers, giving them no small amount of recognition.  This will give you an idea of whether or not becoming a professional is what you really want to do. http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/magazine/http://www.archaeology.org/",

I started my first serious dig, a small 4x4 plot,last week on my property,in my backyard where I find Neolithic Native American tools,flakes,remnants,etc.quite often.Rain had washed out a bifacial white quartz flaked tool remnant,broken ,but similar to many I have found.So beneath it I started the slow tedious scraping away of the grass,small roots,to the thin soil beneath,when I hit an unusually shaped rock,very much alone as yet.(Stones are very rare on my property,which is three inches of soil,then to China is old decomposed granite,very sterile.) I stopped digging just to savor the slow process ,to let it wash off some, and study the soil discolorisations,sit back and ponder,before I dig it out.Interestingly nearby was a small slate knife-like stone,more like a pen knife but not very sharp.I have never seen that type of stone on my property before,I think it is a manuported tool of some prying ability. Now I am really hooked. I know of a cave very high in the mountains near my home,and very hard to find.State experts should be notified to do a serious dig there one day.You can enter it via a drop down \u201clobby\u201d,then a slanting 2 foot wide crack followed by a 4 foot drop to the floor.Twenty feet long and flat,one can easily stand up,or lie down.At the far end is a portal hole to a cliff face ,and is the size of a basketball,so from inside one can see out in two directions.I do not think it ever visited,as I built a rock cairn inside ten years ago,and it was still there untouched last fall.It is state wildlife property and so I cannot dig there,but wish the State would."

But that's not a big deal, because it happens every year and it doesn't affect our climate much. Earth got its own forces going on, like tides and rotation. These forces can also affect our distance from the sun, because they can push back against the sun's gravity. It's like a tug-of-war between the Earth and the sun, and sometimes the Earth wins a little bit. So, we're not getting closer to the sun, we're actually getting farther away from it. But don't worry, it's not like we're gonna leave the solar system anytime soon. The change is very small, like 15 cm per year. That's less than a ruler. And it's not gonna make a difference for our climate or our life on Earth. We're still in the Goldilocks zone, where it's not too hot and not too cold.

This occurs annually, usually around early January, and represents the closest approach of Earth to the Sun in its orbit. The opposite of perihelion is \"aphelion,\" which is the point in the orbit where Earth is farthest from the Sun, typically occurring around early July. The variation in distance between perihelion and aphelion is due to the elliptical shape of Earth's orbit around the Sun.",
