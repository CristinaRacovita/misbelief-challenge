            "c14 is the result of neutron radiation plus nitrogen13 the primary source of that on earth is atmospheric n  neutron generated by cosmic radiation but thats just a really prolific source not the only one diamonds may contain c14 from other source every measurement come with a margin of error if i try to measure c14 concent in a block of gold i am likely to end up with positive result depending on the chosen method",

            "weve been here a trillion time before heres the trillionfirst time to address this crap so if they really are that old they should not have any intrinsic carbon14 in them false c14 is formed by nitrogen atom bombarded by radiation in the atmosphere we have cosmic radiation  thats why c14 is mostly formed high up in the stratosphere in coal and other geological layer c14 is formed by nitrogen bombarded by background radiation of nearby radioactive source the most abundant impurity found in diamond is nitrogen now what happens when diamond are close to pocket of radioactivity well due to the alpha emission some of the nitrogen in it will be mutated into c14 that isnt very difficult to comprehend the same occurs in coal deposit which also contain considerable amount of nitrogen compound thats why we find different rate of c14 present in diamond because not all diamond deposit are found in the vicinity of radioactive source however an outcome of 64900 year to 80000 year normally indicates no c14 present because such result typically point out to the normal background radiation being measured and thats exactly why the the article wa titled use of natural diamonds to monitor 14c ams instrument backgrounds ignorant a you are a the typical layman who mess up thing he doesnt understand whatsoever i shall need to explain about the aim of this study when you want to calibrate any measurement device you need to establish the nullvalue when you measure any amouint of c14 in a specimen in order to date it there is the problem of background radiation so you need to establish the value of the background radiation in order to be able to correct any outcome in future appliance of the device so basically we are dealing here with such a methodological background measurement up to the trillionsecond time but there is one thing that highly annoys me here normally yecs dispute radiometric dating technique to be highly flawed and unreliable unless it suit their aim well of course so question are radiometric dating technique like radiocarbon dating reliiable or not if not you have no trade here arguing about he outcome of this physics research study if you think it reliable then you ought to know that the study yielded age of 64900 year to 80000 year which falsifies the notion the earth is olnly 6000 year old even then the result say nothing because of the reason i mentioned above",
            "ah nomenmeum youve returned last i recall speaking to you i made a specific prediction do you remember what that wa most fossil sample are not dated with carbon dating because it useless even so i can predict perfectly that any fossil sample dated via other method to be million of year old that wa then dated using carbon dating would give a comparatively young age always so all nine diamond are conventionally regarded a being at least of early paleozoic age that is at least several hundred million year old so if they really are that old they should not have any intrinsic carbon14 in them eight of the diamond yielded radiocarbon age of 64900 year to 80000 year i wa right i made an accurate prediction based on only science where is your god",

            "and if you actually read the scientific publication by taylor and southon you will see that the date are at the far end of the applicable age of the method what they have measured is the fail point of their instrument and not the age of diamond edited for clarification",
            "have you read the source they cite nomenmeum this is a real question im interested if youre believing these people with their notorious track record because you want to or because the article paywalled and you have to im sure there are people willing to help if it the latter dont forget baumgardner told a flatout lie about the content of this article probably a good idea to read the actual thing",

            "i dabbled with them a a performanceaid or ade earlier this century redbull really is the best of what wa available at that time it work but it a slippery slope to using them regularly i still have a 89yr old can in the fridge for emergency ie earthquakevolcano disaster where i might need it benefit",
            "i have always liked energy drink for playing softball baseball not squash and for upper end league match i definitely notice the difference now that said you do need to be careful how much you consume it will take me 5 or 6 softball game to go through a 5 hour energy im also a fan of v8 energy but again it exceedingly rare that i would finish even half a can dont underestimate the value of proper eating also and it should start early in the day with eating more veg if you have a blender a balanced smoothie with high energy fruit blueberry apple and some veg  believe it or not good lettuce is good in a smoothie broccoli is good but give a strong flavor kale etc usually about an hour to 30 minute before match will make a surprising difference in your energy",
            "energy drink and hard sport should never ever be mixed usually lead to tachycardia",
            "for me i find it i have caffeine in a lot more concentrated so my drop and volley increase in quality but i also find i tend to over think thing and so im worse at reading my opponent which i am usually very good at i also find my movement become more clunky and feel alot more tiring also make me more sweaty a with you so i tend to stick away from drinking caffeine before i play",
            "an energy drink is nothing different from a suggested coffee its the same effect there isnt anything magical about them caffeine is a component of most pre workout blend so yes it not unusual to feel like that but it very person dependent",
            "for me a can of energy drink help with drowsiness after long work day before squash or having to wake stupid early for a league game if i wa not playing squash i would not even feel it its not caffeine only partially sugar if anything it more reminds of poison alert drinking 6 can or more back to back only lead to stomach pain but not some hyperactive state",
            "every human reacts differently to caffeine do a personal test and find what is working for you for me it is a nono i am getting too excited",
            "like a sweet cough syrup it a acquired taste the more you drink it the more you like the taste",
            "seems like an additive ig"

            "i have to say that some of my best childhood memory are of vacation my parent didnt travel so it wa really just beach and pool i mean i do kind of understand your argument if you mean actual traveling but vacation yes the memory may be vague and some may be more from hearing my parent talk about it later or seeing picture but still still get nostalgic thinking about it also i guess it just a nice thing to see your kid playing at the beach being happy and having fun having those vacation photo is probably also great later when theyre grown up and what about the memory for the parent as someone already pointed out that the parent just want a vacation is a pretty good reason i mean why miss out on vacation andor traveling for 10 year of your life i couldnt go 10 year without a single vacation im currently traveling in sea and ive seen a bunch of people traveling with small kid so obviously there are good enough reason for them another good reason i can think of is when your flexible with your jobcan take time of to travel and your kid are not yet in school because once theyre in school youll be bound to holiday time",

            "setting the bar at 10 year show you know absolutely nothing about kid i went to bali at the end of last year my kid are 4 and 7 and not a week go by where they dont ask to go back",
            "in my opinion bringing your kid with you on vacation when they are too young lets say 10 year is a waste of money they arent going to even remember the journey i went to disney at 6 i can remember it all even the guy in the goofy costume muttering to his aide i need a break or ill fucking pas out i also remember going to new york at 8 and eating street hot dog a a homeless guy peed right on the sidewalk the parent wont fully enjoy it since they have to care for the kid i took my daughter to chicago at 6 it wa a fucking great time there is nothing better than watching a child experience new thing and coming from a town of 500 chicago wa very new to her leave the kid at home and have adultsonly vacation i had plenty of those before kid i want a family vacation like clark w griswold jr but preferably with le moose punching",
            "10 year is something wrong with your brain 10 is plenty old enough to have memory i have lot of memory from over age 5 so do my kid under 5 they have some memoriesunder 2yeah they probably wont remember much but 10 yeah gtfoh",

            "others have given analogy for the first human but here one thats quite close wa there ever a first word of the italian language i hope you can realize that the answer is no and why we know the italian language hasnt always existed but descended from earlier language mostly latin and that language change gradually over time not quite the same way that living thing do for example language mix between each other in way specie usually dont but close enough in the change from latin to italian there wa never a first italian word every latintoitalian speaker at every stage spoke slightly differently from every one else with some personal quirk of pronunciation or idiosyncratic idea of what a word mean or preference on whether to use this word or grammatical construction but because the difference are very small they can all understand each other and speak the same language just like all member of a specie are slightly different from each other but are similar enough to interbreed so that their gene mix in the population but the difference build up over time from generation to generation making the general thing everyone agrees is the language beyond personal quirk change over time until it different enough that it a different language you could pick an arbitrary word along that slow change focus on one arbitrary difference between the italian version of the word and the latin one and point to the first moment a person said that word in this different way instead of the previous one or the moment the percentage of speaker who thought the different way wa the correct pronunciation hit 80 and say thats when the first italian word appeared but youll almost never have a reason to do that will you its an incredibly arbitrary thing to do and if you did have a reason to draw such an arbitrary line like maybe you have a library and trying to classify old text into the latin and italian section youd draw it understanding that the line is arbitrary and that the language people spoke before the first italian word and after the first italian word wa the same language by any measure maybe youd call it protoitalian or late latin or italianate latin or something theres probably an actual name im not bothering to look up come to think of it you just drew a line through it because you needed a line there for some purpose and for your other question yes if you go back way way back into your family tree you eventually run into an animal youd think is a fish and further further further back a cell or two youd think are bacteria its a bit dangerous to confuse this with modern fish and modern bacteria who are your cousin not your ancestor and whose relationship to that very early bacterium or fish in your lineage may be a distant or more a yours waaaaay more if were counting generation and youre looking at your bacterium cousin but youre probably thinking more in term of wa it like basically a fish though or a bacterium a opposed to being a landbased humanoid mammal like i am and a far a that go the answer is yes you are evolved from living organism like that",
            "lots of great response here and many of them allude towithout stating explicitlyacts of definition we can identify a concept and give it a name this act often help u to communicate and to understand for example in history we will remember the great resignation a a thing that happened in the pandemic covid19 is a name given to observable pattern in a virus where each individual virus is different from the others but they share lot of commonality which is to say that word create abstract boundary between concept where the reality that those concept describe often dont have clear boundary but these concept allow u to identify pattern which are useful to u thats all that a specie is its an arbitrary ribbon that we tie around a concept that separate a human from an ardipithecuseven though we know one led to the other graduallyone motherdaughter pair at a time so when you ask was there a first somethingwhat youre really asking is do we have line of sight to every single being that ever lived to be able to draw the line between where the delta variant stopped and omicron variant started and the answer is no no we dont have that kind of perfect complete knowledge of all life in natureand that is precisely why we create these concept of specie to usefully summarize pattern in nature since we can never have a perfect inventory of all being with all of their unique feature",
