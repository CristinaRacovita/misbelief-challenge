It was about the North wanting to control the flow of cheap goods, and Lincoln\u2019s lust for power. I doubt you read in any text book how Lincoln destroyed the system that the founders believed would prevent the government we have today. They lie to convince people that government is necessary, or at worst a necessary evil, when it is in fact unnecessary. No government school teaches about the anarchist societies, such as Zomia that thrived for over 1200 years with a population topping 100 million people. Such examples would shatter the delusion that government is necessary. Logic and critical thought it not taught in grade schools, and by the time you reach college where you might encounter it, you are already indoctrinated (most will be). In fact I knew someone who taught logic who could not look at her own faith in government logically. Consider what lies any small time conman or bully would tell, and why they would tell those lies and you can understand government and why it lies.",
            "To answer this, one would have to believe that there is a stark black and white line between truth and lies. The fact is that in an awful lot of cases there is not. And this is most strongly so in the case of politics, because politics is what happens when people want different and incompatible things. Western governments very rarely tell direct lies. But they use euphemism, misdirection, ambiguity with wild abandon. In which they only do what we all do, but on more subjects and in front of more people.

The fact is that in an awful lot of cases there is not. And this is most strongly so in the case of politics, because politics is what happens when people want different and incompatible things. Western governments very rarely tell direct lies. But they use euphemism, misdirection, ambiguity with wild abandon. In which they only do what we all do, but on more subjects and in front of more people. Every time a politician speaks, they will choose the aspects of their policy that will please the audience they are speaking to. They will make glowing promises, qualified only quietly by phrases like \u201cas soon as financially possible\u201d, \u201cwhen we can\u201d, \u201cprovided circumstances don\u2019t change\u201d. They will switch money from A to B and announce \u201cnew funding for B \u201d. After a quiet interval, they will switch it back and announce \u201cextra money for A\u201d. The important point to remember about politics is that things only come out in public when people disagree. Most of government is routine work that nobody argues about it. So the civil service gets on with it, with no more than ordinary incompetence. So if any action of government comes to your attention is because somebody else wants the opposite of what you want. And government wants to keep you path happy (and voting for them). So they are going to use weasel words automatically. If you are, or feel, they lose, they will promise to make it up \u201cwhen possible\u201d (probably never). And when they don\u2019t, you will see them as liars. So government often appear to be liars, but very rarely are.",

Seeing how we the people vastly outnumber government, law enforcement & military combined by 90%, very dangerous to them would it be for us to realize the actual truth of their shenanigans and where it has the republic to actually stand & how same is viewed by the world. That reason is exactly why prominent outspoken people conveniently meet an untimely demise that renders them also conveniently silent. JFK for example, or Tupac Shakir, Edward Snowden a would be if they find him. Myself, I do not have a multi million listener/follower base to make me much of a threat and has me overlooked in large part as the town kook or conspiracy nut. However & none the less, my case is solid and I pursue it with much zeal to confront this beast any place and opportunity with an untimely demise to be also the only thing that is going to shut me up. A patriot is devoted to his country, not it\u2019s government. In the context of examples of how the government lies to us, here are a couple. Becoming well versed in this area I have learned, is a checkmate for any gov or law official I confront with it and never has a single one ever responded with a single word, they can\u2019t, as I said, checkmate. The key ingredient Turkish poppy for heroin & opiates grows in only one region on the planet. Taliban had those poppies 95% eradicated thus the market 95% quashed just prior to U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. Within the first year of occupation there, heroin productivity skyrocketed to never before seen record high levels & touched every town in America with an opioid EPIDEMIC that still maintains supply to this day.To say Islam or any rogue group or organization holds the logistical ability to disperse & deliver a substance that effectively across the US is to say we have zero national security & that the wars on terror & drugs are miserable failures as dumbass attack ideas.Fresh images, video, & even full documentaries hit the web almost daily as everyone around the world are now packing devices with which to show the world who has taken & holds control of the heroin industry.That's also what says government & law enforcement, even net 43(my local drug task force headed up by our Sheriff) are individually accountable in being one of only 2 possible things, incompetent or accomplice. Now, sure coronavirus has the economy stalled,FOR US, but with big pharma again being the top profiteer & plenty of booty to go around, why would those who turn their heads in consent to an epidemic jump to do shit about a pandemic that also shows potential gains of wealth and/or power to the thugs presently controlling the American hood? This is a letter of inquiry to the then Prosecuting Attorney of Noble County IN after I saw an article in the newspaper about a Noble Co. man who was sentenced to 45 years for dealing meth & a firearm possession. The prosecutor, Eric D. Blackman was talking tough & proud as if he had accomplished something to be proud of. I called him out. Explain to me.... Since they are the exact same thing, what gives government the audacity or the right to sell meth to children under the guise of adhd medication? The only strong message I see on drug dealers in your county is that you DO tolerate it ,just depends on who is selling them. Unless you can cough up one single person that this man forced into buying kids' meds...I mean meth, then you have unjustly deprived him of half his life for a victimless crime. It is matter of fact patriotic DUTY TO RESIST unjust laws imposed upon the people, and an elected official's SWORN duty to uphold justice. Like every inch of the rest of the nation, surely you have seen a quite noticable spike in arrests and presence of Heroin? Being nothing more than a fraudulent ponzi scheme, the war on drugs is the longest lasting and costliest war in Americas history. Not one rung up the ladder has law made it in 40 years of the drug war. Why? Because it is indeed a ponzi scheme designed to bilk the people of and generate wealth for the state. If what I say sounds ridiculous, prove it Mr. \"Prosecutor.\" Are you smarter than a 5th grader? I hope so because it would take a 5th grader within an hour to see, so explain how come......Taliban had the Heroin industry buckled and on it's knees in having the poppy fields nearly eradicated prior to U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, where 90% of the poppy population required for Heroin grows. After U.S.took occupation of Afghanistan, Heroin production shot through the roof to record high levels. Loads of pictures and video showing our troops guarding poppy fields. Now do you believe Taliban, Al Qaeda, Isis or the likes are responsible for this influx of Heroin? If you do, then how dare you slap the people in their faces for assuming us so stupid to believe that law and government can protect us from what a man is thinking and potentially acting out in an act of terrorism. If terrorists had the ability to disperse a substance across the nation in such manner and time, do not you think half the population would be dead and America buckled by now?So unless you have the pair it takes to start climbing the ladder and producing results to show progress in moving up that ladder, you Sir, are nothing more than a treasonous rat like the rest of them.",

            "It\u2019s understandable we can\u2019t find anything. If there were a planet just like Earth in the nearest neighboring star system - even with a civilization just like ours - we wouldn\u2019t be able to detect it. We also occupy the tiniest sliver of time and have only been on the Earth for the past 1/30,000th of its existence. For aliens to find us, they\u2019d have to coexist in the same tiny fragment of time we inhabit. And to top it all off, we occupy the tiniest bit of space and distances are vast. We\u2019re practically blind, have only been around a few seconds and are far away from everything else.",

No chance. There are really two questions here: Could they keep it secret if they wanted to? No. Despite what the tin-hats think, NASA just isn\u2019t set up to keep secrets. This is doubly true of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which runs the Mars rovers, Curiosity and Perseverance. When data comes in, it doesn\u2019t arrive on some super-secret encrypted channel that then gets sent off to two government agents deep inside an underground bunker. The data arrives on one of the three Deep Space Network dishes \u2014 two of which are located in other countries. The data gets stored at the receiver, and ultimately gets stored on servers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to which a lot of people have access. A bunch of people wind up looking at it, long before anyone knows what\u2019s actually in it. Would they even want to keep it a secret? Absolutely not. Finding life is the entire purpose of the mission. It\u2019s like asking: if an Olympic runner won a gold medal, would she want to keep it a secret? NASA would be calling press conference after press conference to announce every last detail of what they had found. I\u2019m always gobsmacked when I hear people suggest that NASA would keep anything secret, especially the discovery of life. Why? Just why? This would be an astounding success for them. Funding would come pouring in. They\u2019d be screaming it from the mountain tops. I\u2019ve read plenty of people on Quora suggest why they might want to cover up such a discovery. What all these suggestions have in common is the breadth and depth of their cluelessness. The researchers might keep it under wraps for a day or two, just to make sure that the discovery was legitimate. Their worst nightmare is to announce that life has been found, and then have to retract it the next day. So the press conference might be scheduled a day or two in advance, and they might spend that time checking and double-checking the results. But even if the data was ultimately found to not be an indication of life, they would still announce what they had found, and describe why it looked at first like life, and why it turned out not to be. SO: Yes, they would announce it. No, they would not \u2014 and could not \u2014 keep it a secret.",

            "We will probably never learn about all the reasons behind the secrecy but here are some more or less speculative reasons:After World War 2 the Cold War with Russia started and when president Truman was presented with the information that alien bodies and technology had been recovered from the Roswell and Aztec crashes he decided to keep this information secret for the present at least and formed the Majestic 12 committee to study what available material there was.

USA was reluctant to share nuclear information with rest of the world and certainly even less willing to share anything they knew about UFOs.In the 1950\u2019s a scientific committee called the Robertson panel was formed to review the results of the US Air Force Project Blue Book study of UFOs. The committee recommended keeping information about UFOs and extraterrestrials secret because the general public would \u201cnot be able to handle it\u201d and panic would result. Furthermore the committee recommended public education programs so that general panic could be avoided. We have certainly seen many movies from Hollywood that include extraterrestrials. \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d included.During the decades after WW 2 the secrecy has become a self-sustaining mechanism. Some presidents have been informed and some have not. According to insider whistle blowers most of the enormous amounts of money used to preserve the secret are used on compartmentalized security and not in technical research. President Eisenhower even threatened to send army troops to occupy Area 51 if they did not deliver regular reports to him about what was going on in the alien front.Another big trend has been the privatization of the secrecy and secret projects to private companies and military contractors. So the military and intelligence agencies have lost much of the control to private industry and not only inside national boundaries but to international global companies. According to some information even these have been divided into competing factions.According to believable studies there are at least 250 so called Black Projects run in the US military establishment. We don\u2019t know how many of these are related to the study of crashed UFOs and recovered alien technology but according to many whistle blowers such projects do exist. When run in private companies they are outside of any government control and probably also outside of the US laws.There is no reason for these private interests to reveal to the general public what they have or what they are doing. As the former director Ben Rich of the Lockheed Skunk Works which does many secret projects for the military once said: it would take an Act of God to get these secrets into the public domain.USA is not the only player in this game. At least the Russians and the Chinese have had their own secret UFO study programs running for decades. Obviously the funding of their programs faces much bigger challenges than in the US.There are probably many more reasons for secrecy than stated above and we will probably never know it all but I think the above or some of it is not too far from the truth.UPDATE November 5th, 2020: Surprisingly we have started seeing minor cracks in the veil of UFO secrecy:US Navy has applied patents on 3 astonishing technologies that quite obviously come from Black Projects:1. Patent on a vehicle that can fly in space, in the Earth atmosphere and under the sea using propulsion methods that look like antigravity or something similar.2. Patent on a material that is superconductive in normal (room) temperatures.3. Patent on a compact fusion reactor that is of the size of a small box of dimensions of one or two feet.Used together the above 3 patents make it possible to construct a vehicle that has at least some of the observed UFO capabilities.The US Navy said they patented these technologies now because they suspected the Chinese were close to doing the same and the Navy wanted to be the first.The patents were first denied but a high ranking Navy officer told the US Patent Office that these technologies were real and not speculation.Besides these patents 3 impressive videos have been published of Navy Super Hornets filming UFOs. The Navy finally has officially confirmed that the videos are real but they \u201cdon\u2019t know what these objects are\u201d. LOL! Well, you have 3 guesses! What in heck could they be?A New York Times article also revealed that the Pentagon has had a secret UFO study Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP) which is followed by a Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) program. The purpose of these programs is to study UFOs and their possible threat to national security.A later New York Times article revealed that US military and some private parties are in possession of \u201crecovered materials\u201d from UFOs. Obviously stuff from UFO crash retrievals which there are quite many known to UFO researchers.",

What possible reason could \u2018authorized people\u2019 have? a. Maybe they feel they are protecting us from the knowledge that we are not the most superior beings in the universe. Unlikely because secrets like this just can\u2019t be kept. Once there are 50 people aware of a secret it\u2019s been proven that knowledge of it will get out. b. Maybe they made a colossal mistake and shot down a UFO. They are now scared of our reaction. Unlikely since the Roswell incident happened so long ago (70 years) and few responsible are even alive now. It also doesn\u2019t say much for the alien technology that they could get across interstellar space but get shot down by primitive savages. c. Maybe they found a crashed UFO and are using its technology to develop super weapons. Again this is unlikely because you don\u2019t cross light years of space and then not have the technology to avoid a crash. d. Maybe the aliens are benign and here to help. They\u2019ve asked the \u2018authorized people\u2019 not to reveal their existence because they feel it will damage us in some way. Unlikely because (2) above would apply and (a) above would reveal the secret. e. Maybe the \u2018authorized people\u2019 are deeply religious and believe that revealing the secret would destroy faith in their god. They have asked the aliens to go away. Again unlikely because of (a). If we discount 3 as being unlikely AND we\u2019ve been visited by aliens then 1 and 2 are left and \u2018authorized people\u2019 simply don\u2019t know any more than we do. By far the most likely scenario is that supported by Occam\u2019s Razor which states:If there are several possible ways that something might have happened, the way that uses the fewest guesses is probably the right one. In that case the most likely scenario is that aliens exist but have not visited the earth. Your \u2018authorized people\u2019 are probably laughing that you believe they know something that you don\u2019t. Of course there\u2019s one other possibility - that the story about the aliens is a hoax used by government to distract people from some other thing they want to conceal such as the development of stealth technology or new weapons. In this case both the government and the aliens the government doesn\u2019t know about are laughing at us.",

Would the Aliens really come in peace? Can we trust them to not exploit us, and not turn us into not just another cog in their space faring machine? Human history, and contemporary occurring are littered with exploitation of those who are unable to resist. From using animals to our benefit, to the horrific evils of colonization, we\u2019ve reduced living breathing organisms to mere object that serve simple purposes. If we as a species are prone to exploiting our own, imagine how vulnerable and juicy a prospect we\u2019d appear to the aliens. Now imagine waking up one morning to find out that our nukes are no longer pointed at each other. Momentary joy, until you read the next sentences. For they are pointed at a foe that has the capability to destroy our race in a more cruel, gruesome and swift prowess than any weapon we possess is capable. Imagine waking up to find that there is nothing to secure a future for yourself. That the government is powerless to resist the might of the Aliens advancing on our planet. The levels of panic that would proceed to occur would severely damage and dampen progress in general and progress towards preparing ourselves for an Alien invasion. I don\u2019t know if Aliens really exist or not. But if they do, then we better be prepared, and careful. They may come in peace, or they may come and recreate horrific segments in human history, except it\u2019s not human doing unto human, but human being done unto by a new foe.",

The short version is as follows: NASA won\u2019t tell us if there is already intelligent extraterrestrial life on another planet yet because no one knows if this is or isn\u2019t the case. We\u2019re still searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, but so far we haven\u2019t found even simple extraterrestrial life.

The short version is as follows: NASA won\u2019t tell us if there is already intelligent extraterrestrial life on another planet yet because no one knows if this is or isn\u2019t the case. We\u2019re still searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, but so far we haven\u2019t found even simple extraterrestrial life. However, if we do one day discover intelligent aliens, then it is possible that some governments might try to cover it up for various reasons. One reason is scientific skepticism. While there have been many claims of extraterrestrial life, there\u2019s no evidence of its existence yet. With our current technology it\u2019s either undetectable or simply hasn\u2019t been detected yet. Knowing this scientists will tend to be doubtful unless solid evidence is presented to back up the claim and those subsequent findings published in a reputable science publication. This failure to say anything before it\u2019s confirmed and reconfirmed could count as a secret, but if a space agency or government wanted to keep it a secret forever the secret wouldn\u2019t last long. Why is that? Simply because that scientific paper that gets published will not only be studied by other scientists but also by journalists looking for a good space story. There are countless popular science based websites that specialize in writing articles about the latest scientific discoveries, and they would definitely notice and report on a research paper of this nature. After the news of the discovery starts to leak out on these smaller science websites, the big media companies, who monitor these smaller science websites, will catch wind of the story. Reporters will recognize the significance of the news and it will quickly catapult to the most important story of the evening, leading as the first story introduced by the T.V. anchorperson. This will happen even before the discovery has been peer reviewed and confirmed by scientists worldwide. Therefore it would ultimately be unsuccessful for a government to hide information about some random discovery of extraterrestrial life, especially since it won\u2019t be the government that makes the discovery. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is made up of ordinary people like you and me, both civilians and scientists, governments and astrophysicists, amateur astronomers and professional astronomers and so on. In other words, the people rule when it comes to science, not the governments of the world. It isn\u2019t unreasonable to assume that regimes ruled by extremists and totalitarians might want to conceal any discovery of extraterrestrials from their citizens. I mean, how would you take the news that extraterrestrial life had been discovered if you were teaching people that six thousand years ago God created Earth and there\u2019s no such thing as \u201caliens\u201d from \u201cother planets?\u201d This news could directly contradict the religious teachings of these totalitarian governments, and they might not want people to know about it. Those governm...",

It\u2019s been suggested that Eisenhower met with representatives from another world when he went missing while in Florida, and many say he made a sort of treaty with these aliens regarding their existence and impact on our planet.  Conspiracy theories kick into overtime on this, and some of it makes perfect sense.  Sharing the ability to travel to other planets wouldn\u2019t seem practical, and no one truly knows how the world would react to news about extraterrestrial life\u2026especially if there are many species and we\u2019re low on the hi-tech totem pole.  Some say the Catholic Church is preparing to deal with such a revelation, which might explain the massive observatory they have in Vatican City.  Religion aside, advanced civilizations wouldn\u2019t want to interfere with our natural development, so talking to a few highly placed government figures might be as far as they\u2019ll go\u2026they could be the ones that wish to remain anonymous.  If anyone has heard of the council of nine, they may have heard that Gene Roddenberry was at a meeting, and could have got his idea for the \u2018Prime Directive\u2019 from that encounter.  Just as Spock and Kirk limited their interactions with pre-warp cultures, so it might be that advanced aliens stay in the shadows until a society is enlightened and ready. There\u2019s many theories and opinions on this, but a purely scientific reaction to life might not be up to scientists; the NSA and CIA would claim responsibility, and their paranoid ways would keep this under several rugs.  Discovering and admitting that microbial life was found might be the first step in a long process, and further announcements might depend on how the world reacts to the notion that life is not exclusive to Earth.  Just 300 years ago, church doctrine stipulated that life began in the Garden of Eden, and God created man in His own image on this planet and nowhere else.  Jesus also cryptically left the door open when he said, \u201cI have other sheep that are not of this fold,\u201d a statement that might suggest Earth is one fold, and other folds could be far from Earth.  Just speculation, but great are the mysteries of life, and where that life may be found.",

There are mostly good answers here. However, there seems to be a widespread belief that all astronomy throughout the world is performed by NASA. This is completely wrong \u2014 MOST astronomy is not done by NASA, but rather by scientists and astronomers throughout the world who mostly work for universities, which own their own equipment, or use equipment that NASA launched and maintains. The overwhelming likelihood is that if humans discover evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, the discovery will not be made by a NASA employee. Regardless of who makes the discovery, it will be announced quickly but not instantly. It\u2019s not that anyone wants to cover up anything; it\u2019s that they don\u2019t want to be made to look foolish. The history of science is replete with examples of scientists announcing discoveries, only to find out that they had made some silly mistake. No astronomer wants to announce that they have received a radio signal from an advanced civilization, only to discover that it\u2019s just radio interference from the Burger King down the road. So they will check and re-check their work, to make sure that there is no possible alternate explanation, and then they will announce. The movie Contact, I think, is a pretty accurate representation of how it will go \u2014 at least the discovery itself. After making the discovery, Elle Arroway\u2019s team calls other astronomers to check their work. Once they\u2019ve ruled out other explanations, one of her colleagues asks, \u201cWho we gonna call now?\u201d and Arroway answers, \u201cEverbody.\u201d The idea that NASA or any scientific organization would cover up such a discovery longer than necessary to make sure it\u2019s accurate is moronic. This is what they live for. The discoverers of extraterrestrials would be world-famous, have fabulous careers for life, and have bucket-loads of money thrown at them to research the discovery. The idea that they would instead cover it up because of, ummm, reasons, is idiotic.",

Never mind that FOX reporter John Roberts admitted that Biden's climate plans do NOT actually limit consumption of meat.CNN reminds, \"Biden has not proposed any limit on Americans' red meat consumption. In fact, he has not proposed any limit on Americans' consumption of any food. The false claim about Biden trying to restrict people to four pounds of red meat per year appears to have originated with a deceptive Thursday article by the British tabloid The Daily Mail. The article baselessly connected Biden's climate proposals to an academic paper from 2020 that is not about Biden and says nothing about the government imposing dietary limits.\"But fact-checking serious public lies won\u2019t stop the fright-wing media apparatus. In 2006\u2019s On Truth, moral philosopher, Harry Frankfurt, described the ethical effect of lies. They are not just deceptions. They are not just duplicity. They are injuries. \u201cLies are designed to damage our grasp of reality,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo they are intended, in a very real sense, to make us crazy.\u201d But more than that, they are authoritarian injuries. \u201cThe most irreducibly bad thing about lies is that they contrive to interfere with, and to impair, our natural effort to apprehend the real state of affairs,\u201d Frankfurt wrote. \u201cThey are designed to prevent us from being in touch with what is really going on. In telling his lie, the liar tries to mislead us into believing that the facts are other than they actually are. He tries to impose his will on us.\u201dOn Truth - WikipediaFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Book by Harry Frankfurt On Truth is a 2006 book by Harry Frankfurt , a follow-up to his 2005 book On Bullshit . [1] It develops the argument that people should care about truth , regardless of intent to be truthful. It explicitly avoids defining \"truth\" beyond the concept commonly held, which corresponds to reality . [2] References [ edit ]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_TruthWhich brings me to Frankfurt\u2019s other book, On Bullshit. In that one he explains to a T McCarthy for what he is, a bullshitter. The book defines the concept and analyzes the applications of bullshit in the context of communication. Frankfurt determines that bullshit is speech intended to persuade without regard for truth. The liar cares about the truth and attempts to hide it; the bullshitter doesn't care if what they say is true or false, but rather only cares whether their listener is persuaded. How do we stop it? I think by seeing through the lie to what\u2019s genuinely intended, which is to say, through the lie toward a conscious authoritarian intent to injure our democratic republic. Lying about the Biden administration\u2019s \u201cwar on meat\u201d is by itself silly, but in context, a grotesque attempt to dominate a gullible television audience. Republican lawmakers don\u2019t have ideas. As a matter of fact, they\u2019re hostile to the idea of ideas. They refuse recognizing the legitimacy of those of a political opposition. What they did is, they have constructed a right-wing media apparatus to foment enough instability, chaos and, yes, insanity to create a desire among normal people for a strongman to come and fix things. They are, as Harry Frankfurt intimated, setting the groundwork for a fuhrer-king \u201cto impose his will on us.\u201d Meanwhile, at Hillary Clinton\u2019s house:Toodles!",

The subliminal messages \u2013 that all of this influencer marketing is supposed to tell us \u2013 are:Be cool and you\u2019ll be admired.Be cool and you\u2019ll belong.Be cool and you\u2019ll get laid.Be cool and you\u2019ll get respect.By now you are probably waiting for a big fat BUT. So here it is. BUT in our social media infested times, countless men and women believe that if they don\u2019t fit the \u201ccool\u201d mold then they won\u2019t get attractive partners, won\u2019t be accepted in a group of interesting people, won\u2019t be worthy of others\u2019 attention, won\u2019t be taken seriously by colleagues, and so on. It\u2019s clear; coolness has become a social currency with tremendous value. So everyone tries really hard to become cool.Even Jeff Bezos thinks cool is good. Source The big problem is most people\u2019s definition of coolness. Here is what most people think will get them some cool:Perfection - People who fail or have shortcomings are uncool. The cool person is always a winner, never has bad breath, never trips over stuff.Beauty - Beautiful equals cool. It\u2019s as simple as that. Guys try to get huge, women chastise themselves in an attempt to get the elusive thigh gap and be super cool on social media.Status - The more people know and admire you the cooler you are.Sexy partners - Date only the sexiest people (a large number of them at best) and others will see you as cool.Money and luxury - A cool person is never broke. They drive Lambos, ride stallions, boat through the Mediterranean, or blaze down the street on motorcycles.Success - The advent of the startup age has shown that nerdy guy + success = charismatic (cool) entrepreneur.Plastic surgery, status symbols, vain relationships with friends and romantic partners, bankruptcy and depression ensue.Floyd Mayweather\u2019s Instagram is stacked with glowing examples of coolness. Source Too many people give everything they have (including their health) to become cool and then, eventually, realize that it was all for nothing. The only way out of this dilemma is to shift our mindsets of what cool means to us. A new definition of cool What makes others the coolest in our eyes isn\u2019t their bling or sexual track record. It\u2019s them not giving a sh*t whether they are cool or not and rather following what they themselves find meaningful. Here are some examples to debunk our false perception of what makes someone cool:Peter Dinklage surely isn\u2019t cool because he suffers from achondroplasia (a form of dwarfism). He\u2019s cool because he didn\u2019t accept his (quite real) limitations, overcame the odds and became an incredible actor. SourcePierce Brosnan and his wife Keely Shaye Smith: How cool is it that the real James Bond doesn\u2019t give a damn about trophy wives and is rather happy with the same woman for more than 18 years? SourceBill & Melinda Gates with Warren Buffet: These folks could easily afford to buy a mega yacht in the shape and size of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and have The Rolling Stones perform on it every night. Yet they are giving billions of dollars back to society. How uncool\u2026 ;-) SourceDo you think Gandhi would have cared about his Insta follower count? I bet most people still think of him as pretty cool. SourceMalala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel Prize laureate: Malala almost has a million Instagram followers, yet, somehow I think she didn\u2019t get them by posting half naked pictures of herself. Source It\u2019s not what you\u2019ve experienced, or wear, or own that makes you cool. It\u2019s what you do with your life.",

It is well known there just how advanced and modern is China. But perhaps in the USA the media are, as the Donald says, full of \u201cFalse News\u201d! However, in the past, China was indeed less modern and maybe even the way many people still believe it to be. The truth is that Asian countires are the new modern advanced places on Earth. I live in Australia, New Zealand, Scotland and China - my wife of 6 years is Chinese.. Before my first visit to China (about 10 years ago) I expected the countryto be rather backward and maybe dirty. And, in fact, at that time, the city where I now spend a lot of time (and I am in Foshan, Guangdong as I write this) was not much better than I expected. Visibility was about a half kilometer. I remember a bridge near where I stayed (a Hotel in Foshan) - I could only ever see half way across it though it was less than a km long. And on a trip to Beijing ( a few months before the Olympic Games) I witnessed air pollution all the way from Guangzhou to Beijing. There were lots of small scooters and small motorbikes, bicycles, tricycles all over the place. not too many cars and horrendous driving. There were many small \u201cshops\u201d with open fronts and someone repairing washing machines, bicycles etc. But I have been returning to China every year since. And every year I see improvements and advancement. Now, there is no pollution and I can see for many many kms in clear air. The roads have almost no motorcycles at all (and I haven\u2019t seen a scooter since I arrived a week ago). The cars are nearly all quality cars and fairly new, and the roads are now quite busy. The driving standard has still a way to go - but is a million times better than it was. The shops, the malls etc are better than any I know in UK, NZ or Australia.

Many of the foreign netizens on Quora who have expressed rational opinions on China are those who have been to China and tend to describe their experiences in China.

Many of the foreign netizens on Quora who have expressed rational opinions on China are those who have been to China and tend to describe their experiences in China. On the contrary, those who post extreme and untrue comments always speak in a tone of judgment, and the arguments they can give are based on what they read on the Internet or heard from others. It's easy to tell which is more real. So this is why if we want to know something about China we tend to trust foreigners, especially those who have been to China, because they are more neutral and neither defend China nor misunderstand China.Now to your question, Why do many foreigners who come to China think what they saw is so much different from what they heard at home? We often say that to see is to believe, Those who have been to China see China as it really is through their own eyes. What is life like for ordinary Chinese? Is Chinese society chaotic or peaceful? Is the countryside poor? what the poor eat? Are there concentration camps in Xinjiang, China? -- all questions are answered. Since what they see for themselves is the truth, what they hear at home, from the government or the media, is a lie. Some things are not as complicated as we think, and China is not such an unfathomable country. If you really want to know, you can get the answer by yourself. I know that because of the epidemic, the distance, the strangeness, many of us will not easily go to a distant country across the ocean, but there are many ways for us to learn the truth.The first step is to get rid of prejudices and stereotypes about China. If you don't put yourself in an objective position, how can you get a different opinion? You only browse and thumb up what you want to see, big data will only push you that, and over time you are stuck in an information cocoon. So, please keep thinking critically about what the government and media say, try to use Chinese social software, learn about the daily happenings of Chinese people on it, and read more answers about China on Quora, maybe some of them have been to China.

You might change your mind.\u201d I was twenty-five years old, begging my OB-GYN to take out my uterus. I begged her. I cried. My mom sat in the room with me, lowering her eyes. I was twenty-five, and my period never stopped. Ever. Not since I first got it when I was ten years old. Bleeding heavily for 365 days till they (doctors) decided to do something about it. If it wasn\u2019t for birth control, I wouldn\u2019t even catch a break. But even breaks weren\u2019t guaranteed. They were sporadic. Unpredictable. Sometimes it would stop the bleeding, often times it wouldn\u2019t. Soon enough, it\u2019d stop working entirely. It always stopped working eventually. \u201cYou may want kids,\u201d she assured. \u201cHow?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow am I supposed to have kids when my uterus doesn\u2019t stay lined? How am I even supposed to have sex off of birth control when I can\u2019t stop bleeding?\u201d My voice grew louder with every word till my mom had enough of my shouting. \u201cReilyn! That\u2019s enough.\u201d I wanted her to answer my questions. I wanted to know. I was told when I was younger it may not be possible for me to have my own children. I may not be able to get pregnant. When I was a teenager, this information didn\u2019t bother me. I didn\u2019t care about relationships. I was asexual. The thought of anyone being near me or intimate with me severely grossed me out. I also didn\u2019t like kids. They were noisy, loud, obnoxious, and rude. I was also a problem child to my parents. In multiple ways. The last thing I wanted was a mini version of me. Having a hysterectomy would guarantee two things: 1. I couldn\u2019t get pregnant. Therefore, no kids.2. The bleeding would stop. But I was denied, because I was \u2018too young\u2019 to make that decision. Because I might change my mind. Even though I most likely bled more than my doctor and her entire staff combined. Fast forward two years, and I\u2019m twenty-seven. Laying on my mom\u2019s bed, I was on the phone with my guy friend from Minnesota. My sister\u2019s pregnant, and we started talking about children and large families. \u201cI think it\u2019d be cool to have a big family,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve only got my sister but I have a lot of cousins.\u201d \u201cSame,\u201d I said. \u201cMy mom had seven siblings.\u201d \u201cAnd the older ones can help out with the younger ones -\u201d \u201cKids are expensive though.\u201d \u201cYeah - that\u2019s if I were to start a family. I\u2019m still not sure about it. Or if I\u2019d even be a good father.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure you would be.\u201d There were times when he and I discussed the future. Not necessarily one where we\u2019d be together, but not necessarily one where we\u2019d be apart. He wants to move out of Minnesota, and he always asks me what I think of the places he\u2019s picked, though he insists he wants to visit Hawaii first - but I think I mostly talked him out of wanting to live here. I was still stuck on the children conversation. Even now. Being around my very pregnant sister constantly reminded me of it. Meanwhile, someone else I know is trying to get pregnant, and she can\u2019t. What am I most worried about? False hope. I\u2019m worried my OB-GYN gave me false hope.

It had come up in conversation, and I knew he didn\u2019t know what it meant. My father told me that it wasn\u2019t my place to talk to my brother about \u201chomosexual things,\u201d comparing him wanting me to keep quiet about anything to do with the LGBT+ community to how I complain when he makes poop or vomit jokes at the dinner table. I said I didn\u2019t think that was fair. I told him that I was beginning to figure myself out when I was his age, and I knew I couldn\u2019t safely talk to either of my parents about how I was feeling. I want my brother to have someone he can trust, in case he ever questions his sexuality or gender. Things escalated from there. My father told me I was too young to know my sexuality. I\u2019m seventeen, almost eighteen. He said that all bisexual people are polyamorous, untrustworthy, and guaranteed to cheat and give me STDs. He said that all trans people \u201cexperiment sexually.\u201d I reminded him that asexual trans people exist. He said I had no idea what I was talking about. I started pulling up peer-reviewed scientific studies on my phone. He said he didn\u2019t care about the science. He just knew he was right. Then my ex-girlfriend, a transgender woman, came up. My father said he was confused that she wanted to date \u201creal\u201d women, because of course all trans people are extreme homosexuals. I reminded him that my ex is bisexual. He said she was \u201ca guy in a dress\u201d preying on a minor. That she was lying to take advantage of me sexually. I told him that I knew she was trans from the moment we met, because she told me she was. I said she was very respectful and never did anything to try to pressure me into sex. And she wasn\u2019t preying on me, a poor innocent minor. Heck, we were both minors for the first six months of our relationship. My dad repeated the phrase \u201che-she whatever.\u201d He called Rebecca, my ex-girlfriend and current friend, an it. I left the room, like I always do when he calls trans people it. He chased after me, yelling. Upstairs, I put on my shoes. I ran out of the house. I walked for two hours, putting several miles between my father and me. I knew I\u2019d have to go home eventually, but part of me wanted to just keep walking. Eventually, I rang someone\u2019s doorbell and used their phone to call my mother to come and get me. At home, my father demanded I bring him my credit card and cut it in half. For a long time, I hoped that one day I could come out to my father and he\u2019d accept me. I don\u2019t feel like he respects most of what I have to say. When we argue, he displays some behaviors that can be classified as emotionally abusive. My therapist talked to him about it a few times, and he promised to try, but then nothing changed. Now he openly mocks her during our arguments. One of the things she suggested was taking breaks when things get heated. When I try to take a break from an argument, he follows me no matter where I go, yelling. He never apologizes. Nowhere in my house feels completely safe, though I do have a few last-resort hiding places where he hasn\u2019t found me yet. I remember getting in trouble and being sent to my room almost every day as a kid, and thinking something was wrong with me, that I was \u201cbad.\u201d Now I realize that I\u2019m like a lightning rod. My father has severe anger issues, and instead of taking them out on everybody in our house, he takes them out on me. My little brother keeps telling me not to provoke him, but everything I do seems to provoke him. My father broke one of my lamps. My father broke three of my alarm clocks. My father threw my nightstand across the room. My father smashed the coffee table in his office. My father kicked my laptop. My father threw my first Kindle on the kitchen floor so hard that the screen was permanently damaged. After many of those incidents, he pointed out that he really wanted to hit me, but he restrained himself. He has often told me that he will never hit me, but his destructive outbursts scare me anyway. My father punched my bedroom door, leaving a dent. He promised to paint over it, just like he promised to buy me a new lamp. In the end, I put a National Geographic dolphin poster over it. Every time I look at the poster, I want to cry. I have accepted that things with my father are likely never getting better. It breaks my heart, because the fucked up truth is that I love him. He\u2019s my dad. I love him. What scares me is that when I go off to college, my father might start treating my little brother the way he treats me. What scares me is that the safest option is probably to cut him out of my life, but doing that will probably also mean losing my mom and my brother, both of whom I love. I can\u2019t stop being transgender, and I can\u2019t change my father. I wish I could. God. I wish I could.",

But, why a tech firm specifically? Is it because you have a potentially profitable idea, or is it because of companies like Facebook, Google, Dropbox, SnapChat, etc? If it\u2019s the latter, you\u2019ll burn out quickly. Focus on launching a business that you\u2019re interested in, not what someone else tells you to launch.

It clears your mind, and it keeps you in good shape. Very important, whether you\u2019re an aspiring entrepreneur or not. But, you need to be wide awake, too. No use jogging at 5 AM if you\u2019re barely awake. You won\u2019t walk 5 steps.\u201cYou can build a profitable business on $500\u201d. Staying within a reasonable budget for your business is essential. But, $500 is nowhere near enough to make an impact with your advertising. People have busy lives, so you\u2019ll need to use reminder marketing and audience building to stay relevant and earn sales. Can\u2019t afford to spend money on marketing and advertising? Well, I guess you\u2019ll need a job to afford that. You could try dropshipping to avoid production costs, but then you won\u2019t know what your product quality is. You won\u2019t know your shipping times, either. And you\u2019ll be selling items that 500 other stores, including Amazon and eBay, are selling. Not a good business model\u2026\u201cYou need to hustle\u201d. Entrepreneurship is hard work. But, gurus have convinced people that you must work 24 hours, 7 days a week to succeeed. People do this for a week, and they burn out very, very quickly. They even get health problems from it. You need downtime. You need rest. You\u2019re a human, not a robot. Set aside some time for napping, resting, and you\u2019ll find yourself far more productive and much happier.\u201cIf you don\u2019t buy this course, it\u2019s because you aren\u2019t serious about changing your life\u201d.

It\u2019s called \u201cFOMO\u201d, or fear of missing out, and it\u2019s highly effective for seminar salespeople. Whether these seminars work for the students is another story. Research shows that they tend to bankrupt their students.Follow your passion, and you\u2019ll succeed. You can start a business based on your passion IF AND ONLY IF there\u2019s a market demand for your passion and there\u2019s a way to make it stand out from the competition. If there\u2019s no demand, then forget it. For example, if you\u2019re passionate about silly cartoons and there\u2019s a market demand for silly cartoons, go start a business making silly cartoons. It worked well for Walt Disney and Max Fleischer after all. If you\u2019re passion about painting, start a business selling paintings because there\u2019s a market demand for them. But, if you\u2019re passionate about paper, you\u2019ll probably have a hard time selling that. It\u2019s hard to make paper stand out from other paper. It\u2019s just a sheet made from trees.\u201cDon\u2019t worry if you fail\u201d. Failure is apart of life. So long as we can learn from it, we\u2019re all good. But the question is, would you rather fail when you\u2019re 25, single, and have no responsibilities or debts? Or, would you rather fail when you\u2019re 45, have 2 kids to care for, and a monthly mortgage to worry about? For lots of people, failure really isn\u2019t an option, especially if you\u2019ve got dependents. I know guys like Kiyosaki say that you might as well go out with a bang if you fail. That mindset led to tons of folks filing for personal bankruptcy when they bought real estate and couldn\u2019t sell it about 9\u201310 years ago. That was one thing I really didn\u2019t agree with him in Rich Dad, Poor Dad.\u201cYou need to put socializing on hold and focus 100% on entrepreneurship\u201d. Some gurus have convinced people that having a life outside of business is a sign hat you aren\u2019t dedicated to your business. That\u2019s BS. Your family and friends can encourage you and keep you inspired. Sometimes, they\u2019ll even invest in your business. You don\u2019t have to go it alone. Having some help along the way is a necessity. No one is truly \u201cself-made\u201d, in the sense that they achieved success all by themselves.\u201cYou need a mentor\u201d. Someone who holds you accountable and inspires you is an important part of your success. Some guidance helps, too. However, thanks to business blogs around the web, would-be business owners are now throwing away $2,000+ for \u201cmentorship\u201d and \u201ccoaching\u201d programs. Sadly, they still often find that these programs don\u2019t do jack for their business success. Spending $3,000 on that \u201cmentor\u201d won\u2019t make you reach financial success any faster. A real mentor will take you under their wing without any expectation of being paid. True mentorship is a form of friendship; real friendships aren\u2019t based on money. And, ultimately, success comes from within, not from outside. You can have all the mentors in the world. If you can\u2019t bring success for yourself, it won\u2019t happen.",

We listen to coaches and self-proclaimed experts and lie to ourselves that if we work hard, we'll succeed. We create an unhealthy environment where founders mindlessly work until they burn out. An environment that lets us cut ties with friends and family. An environment that has no place for founders who work part-time because they need to take care of their children. Seriously? Even the old-school corporate where one of my friends works manages to cleverly integrate two part-time working single moms who share a top management position. Dear \u201cexperts\u201d and \u201cmindset coaches\u201d: Please cut the crap and allow entrepreneurs to love the work, but hate the workload.

It was sudden, no advance notice, no prior warning nothing. It was not that I was idle, I was neck deep in a project, working on a crucial module. There was no attempt even made to give me time to do a Knowledge Transfer to other colleagues. I was asked not to speak to any colleagues about this, was just asked to take my belongings and leave.  The irony was that I was the one who had done more work on my module than others, got it up and running. There were issues, but primarily due to lack of  guidance. Basically the management had no clue about how to manage the project, the specifications just keep changing randomly, and it got escalated. They needed some scapegoat, since I was the one getting the higher pay it fell on me. It was not an easy feeling at all, I had a family to support, I had bills to pay, I had to pay the tuition fees for my daughter's school and here I was out of a job, staring at an uncertain future ahead. It was hard to be facing this, and for 4 months I was jobless, one of the worst period of my life. It was also the time I realized, that corporate relationships never really have any meaning.  All those colleagues with whom I was hanging out, boozing, did not even bother to call me up and find what happened. Not even a single courtesy call, and these were the same guys who used to literally force me to join some party. Not that I believed in it earlier,  but this whole corporate bonding, team bonding thing is an utter sham. It was not that bad at my earlier workplaces, where we had a good bonding, even after I left the company.

We\u2019d known for several weeks and it felt fantastic to finally share the good news with everyone. We had been window-shopping for homes online in preparation for the new addition, and that Saturday we casually attended an open house nearby. A little over twenty four hours later, we were looking at houses with the realtor we\u2019d met at the open house. At the last house we visited, we knew that it was the house we wanted. It was perfect for our family. It was everything we wanted in a first home; three bedrooms, a studio space, a huge back yard, even a well-maintained garden! By the end of the next week, we\u2019d officially reached mutual acceptance with the sellers of the house. We were going to buy our first home! It seemed like everything was going right in our life. In my life, the good and the bad never seem to get evenly spread around. The bad all clumps up together and the good all happens at once. Usually, though, there\u2019s a lot of neutral stuff in between the good and bad sections. This time, however, the bad came screaming in at eighty miles per hour, pulling a trailer, and rear-ended the good. We came out to our car Saturday morning to find that somebody had taken the left front wheel off of our car, slashed the tire, jammed the whole thing under the body of the car, and stolen the lugnuts and hubcap. The policeman tells us he thinks the person was trying to steal the catalytic converter. He tells us that another car in the complex was broken into the same night. He tells us, very politely, that our complex is pretty much a cesspool. \u201cNot to disparage your residence, but we have a lot of problems in that area.\u201d I went in to work the next Monday and went through my day as usual. Mid-afternoon, the CEO and CTO pull me aside (it\u2019s a small startup, so I talk to these guys regularly), and inform me that I\u2019m being laid off. For a few moments, I don\u2019t breath, blink, or move. I get mild tunnel vision, my skin flushes, and I get the dreamy \u201cthis can\u2019t be real\u201d feeling because I can\u2019t believe that the worst possible words are coming out of my bosses\u2019 mouths. I go back to my desk, speechless, the dreaminess and tunnel vision still not completely gone. I\u2019m a bit shellshocked. It finally hits me and I head outside to call my wife. At this point, the adrenaline is catching up to whatever brought on the numbness from minutes before, and I\u2019m hyperventilating a little bit. My wife answers and I don\u2019t beat around the bush. \u201cI just got laid off,\u201d I spit out in despair. Now, at this point, let me take a brief moment to explain to you about my wife. She is, without equivocation, the best thing that has ever happened to me. Never in a million years would I have ever guessed that I would find a woman so supportive and loving and kind to be my wife. With that in mind, think of how devastating this news is, not just for me, but for her, and for us. She\u2019s pregnant, we\u2019re about to buy a house, and I\u2019m losing my job. The natural reaction would be for her to start bawling into the phone and screaming or freaking out like I clearly already was. And that reaction would be completely understandable and not something that anybody could hold against her. My wife instead said this, \u201cJake, it\u2019s going to be ok. Things are gonna be fine. Do you need me to pick you up from the bus?\u201d I told her I had till the end of the week and was going to finish up the work day and then head home at my normal time. We get the most devastating news ever and instead of freaking out with me, she shows immense strength and compassion and tells me that things are going to be ok. Now, I\u2019m sure that as soon as I got off the phone she screamed or bawled or something else, but before all that, she injected some peace into my heart and mind. Helluva lady. I went through the last two hours of my work day in a haze, instant messaging with my coworkers about the layoffs (there were several others as well), and feeling awful about the entire situation. Could I have done something different? Should I have worked harder at finding a new job before this happened? Had I completely let down my wife? I call my parents on the way home, and their sympathy almost makes me break down in tears. Almost. But I keep it together and get on the bus for home. All the way home, my stomach is full of knots. I\u2019m cold and shaky despite the warm weather. And sweaty. I feel sick. I feel like the world is moving a thousand miles an hour around me while I shamble in slow motion home. I get inside, and like usual, our dog is losing her mind with excitement that I\u2019m home. My wife embraces me and I start to lose it again, but clamp back down. She\u2019s in the middle of making dinner, so I let her get back to that and I slump down on the couch and let the dog climb all over me, showing me how happy she is that I\u2019m home. From the kitchen (which, in that 680 sq/ft apartment, was about 10 feet away) my wife tells me something that must have been some kind of revelation from god or womanly intuition or something, because it\u2019s exactly what I need to hear, \u201cJake, I want you to know that no matter what, I am not mad at you, or upset with you, or disappointed in you.\u201d Well, ladies and gentlemen, after keeping a tight lid on it up to this point, I finally lost it. I broke down. I can not stress to you the life-altering, breathtaking, borderline magical power of having a loving, supportive wife. Though we were both terrified of our new situation and devastated about the the impact it would have on buying a home, my wife was thinking of me. She knows me well and knew that I would probably be beating myself up about it. She knew that I would feel the whole weight of both of our sadness on my shoulders. And she told me exactly what I needed to hear. I didn't feel much like eating the delicious dinner she made and I kind of floated through the rest of the evening with a sense of disappointment and despondency floating through my head. I told myself that I could have that one night to feel sorry for myself and be frustrated, angry, and negative. I decided that after that, I would be productive, optimistic, and driven. I wasn't sure how, because I tend to be kind of a pessimistic dude, but I knew I didn't really have a choice. I didn't have time for that crap. My wife called and talked to our realtor and the mortgage officer we were going to use, and told them that I no longer had a steady income and we no longer qualified for the mortgage. It was official. We were losing the house. The house we\u2019d already moved into emotionally. The house that was going to be where we started our family. Where our baby would come home from the hospital, and where he'd take his first steps. Where our dog would be able to run at full speed in the back yard and chase squirrels. We were being banished back to the world where people randomly take your wheel off your car in the middle of the night to try to steal a car part, and when they fail at doing it because they\u2019re probably high, they slash your tires and steal your lugnuts to spite you. I went to bed earlier than usual that night, but couldn't sleep. All I could think about was how I had no idea what I was going to do. About how we\u2019d lost the house. And I couldn't stop wondering if somebody was outside right then trying to do something to my car. I finally started praying. Not your typical, going-through-the-motions kind of prayer. I was talking to God and begging for help. I was terrified about my future and heartbroken about the present. I asked for comfort. I asked for guidance. I asked for opportunity. I asked that, somehow, by miraculous intervention, I could be positive and optimistic about all of this. That somehow I might feel hope. After a solid half-hour conversation with God, I went to sleep. I woke sometime after 5 am because my wife was weeping in bed next to me. Losing the house was so devastating, especially when we had been so close. She worded it perfectly: \u201cI feel like my fianc\u00e9 has broken up with me three days before the wedding.\u201d  (NOTE: Waking up to your wife crying in bed next to you is pretty much the worst thing in the world. Just saying.) I had to visit my chiropractor the next day, and my wife had to work, and we needed to visit my parents, so we all piled into the car the next morning and headed south. Most of my day was going to be devoted to job hunting. Job applications, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and cover letters make my head swim and my blood boil. They make me feel despondent and tired. They suck the life out of me. But I had promised myself that night before was my only allotted \u201dfeeling sorry for myself\u201d time, and so I  approached the day with every ounce of can-do that I had in me. Furthermore, I\u2019d asked God to help me be optimistic and hopeful, so I figured I\u2019d try to meet him part way. If he was going to send me the ability to be optimistic, I might was well try to act on the ability I was asking for. I will accept no other word short of \u201cmiraculous\u201d to describe the fact that, as the day progressed, not only did I not get depressed, or feel hopeless, or get angry, but I actually began to feel positive. I began to feel like something good was in my future. I began to feel like things were going to get better. I felt a miraculous aura of comfort, optimism, and peace begin to infuse me. It ebbed and flowed a bit, that first full day on the job hunt, but as we drove home that night, it struck me in what I can only describe as a revelation. I turned to my wife and said, \u201cYou know what? Things are going to be ok. I know it.\u201d My wife, being the aforementioned saint that she is, was way ahead of me: \u201cOh, I know that. I don\u2019t doubt it one bit.\u201d If you doubt my use of the word miraculous, I will tell you that the positivity and hopefulness lasted for months. I was productive and positive in the face of an enormous loss, and that is not normal behavior for me. The next morning, I got up to go back to work. I sat, mentally poring over the job leads that friends had fed me on the hunt the previous day, as I ate a bowl of cereal and watched a little Law & Order with my wife. I got an unexpected text from a coworker telling me that he had a lead for some contract work for me and wanted to help. This was the second time where I broke down. It made me realize just how blessed I am to have so many kind, generous, compassionate people in my life. My wife, my parents, dozens of coworkers and friends spread across the state and country. Tears rolled down my cheeks as I thought about how people were going out of their way to help me out in this difficult time. I got to work and the barrage of kindness continued. It seemed like every one of my coworkers has some lead on a position, or a job, or a company that was hiring, or a good staffing agent. My coworkers, whom I was always certain I annoyed the hell out of, were all reaching out to help. One of them even insisted on buying me lunch even though he could easily justify pinching his pennies, he himself getting his hours cut back due to the same circumstances that led to the layoffs. The outpouring of compassion and kindness I was shown in that tough time was more than I could have ever dreamed of. I can\u2019t express enough gratitude for the wonderful people I have in my life. I finally understand why my mom always cried whenever we watched It\u2019s a Wonderful Life when I was a kid. I feel much like George Bailey did at the end of the movie as he reads Clarence\u2019s parting words: \u201dRemember: no man is a failure who has friends.\u201d It's been a year and about eight months since this happened. I've done a lot of contract work and worked some crappy day jobs, but not only have we stayed afloat, we bought a house last October, and I have my final interview this week for a really fantastic full-time position doing exactly what I want to be doing. It's been a long path being underemployed (at pretty much the worst time to be looking for a job in the last seventy years), but things are finally on the up-and-up. Oh, and my son is absolutely adorable and makes trudging through every rejection and unanswered job application worth it:Note: My big interview is on Thursday afternoon. Any thoughts/prayers/good vibes you can send my way are appreciated. :) Update:  Unfortunately, I probably didn't get the job.  There were three rounds of interviews today, and I only got through two. However, I have a few other prospects I'm remaining hopeful about, and I'm taking programming classes at Code Fellows, so I'm not losing hope. I've been blown away by the response I've gotten on this post. I can't thank you all enough for your concern, kindness, and moral support during my struggle. It has brought me almost to tears reading all of your encouraging words ad kind thoughts. :) PostScript: I work in video game audio. If any if you happen to know of any studios or teams that need audio or music work done, here's my portfolio: http://www.jakehawken.com SECOND UPDATE: Because the universe seems to hate me and everything bad seems to happen at once, our home was burglarized today and lots of expensive things were stolen from us. Things we can't afford to replace. We have insurance but we're not making much money right now so the deductible is going to hit us really hard. THIRD UPDATE (October , 2 years after losing my job):  I've now taken the two introductory courses and on Monday (Oct. 6th), I'll be starting my 8-week, 40hr/week Development Accelerator course at Code Fellows. It will be very challenging and time-consuming, but I'm going to learn a lot. I'm very excited and I can't wait to get started. The average graduate from my track has a job in four to six weeks after graduating, so here's to hoping I have a full-time job by year's end! Wish me luck! :) FOURTH UPDATE (December 3, 2 years and 3 months after losing my job):  I just finished up at Code Fellows yesterday and I'm now officially a certified iOS developer! My job prospects look pretty decent and things are starting to look up! :) FIFTH UPDATE (February 10, 2 years and 5 months after losing my job):  I started a contract position as an iOS developer at a startup in Seattle! It's not an employee position, but it is a huge step up. I have no complaints. I'm very happy about it. I'm still shopping for full-time employment, but hopefully this will turn into it. SIXTH (and final) UPDATE (April 6, 2 years and 7 months after losing my job): I got a job! A full-time job! Finally. Thanks to everyone for your immense kindness, encouragement, and support. You've all been wonderful! (OK, ONE MORE):  That startup I was at went under but I'm totally confident I'll get a new job soon. In the meantime though, if you feel so inclined as to help out, check out this Kickstarter campaign for a game I've been working on with a couple friends: Haven's Demise THE FOR-REAL FINAL UPDATE:  I just got a job that is not only a great job, and is not only a full-time job at a stable company, but the #1 job on my list. It's the exact job I've been trying to get for the last seven months, and I got it! There is no more perfect job for me right now than this job. I can't tell you how ecstatically happy I am right now. And not only is it my ideal job at the company I want to work at most, but they really like me and have so much nice stuff to say about me. Anyway, thanks again for all the encouragement and empathy. Quora users rock!",

But then the joining was too late so I thought to try my luck. I started searching for jobs offcampus. One day Iwas called for the selection procedure in a startup. There were thousands of people in that test. I told myself that it is ok , even if I don't pass this , I atleast have a job offer. But either luckily or unluckily, I made till the final rounds and we were 8 freshers who made through it. I was on the 11th sky. I was so happy. We joined immediately. It was nice. I was full of energy and enthusiasm. They divided the work and we were onboarded quickly. I got my first salary and that day I bought a beautiful saree and a shirt for my parents. They were too happy. It all was going well. After 6 months I applied for a leave to go to my native place for Holi. I had got gift for everyone. I always wanted to do this. All my uncles, aunts brother and sisters, their kids, well everyone infact. I was at my sister's place for dinner when I got a call from the director. There was too much noise hence I went to the terrace to have that conversation. It was silent there. The director then told me that we are letting you go from today onwards. I didnot understand the statement so I asked him again that what does he mean? He said that I am no longer wanted in the company so when I come back from vacation I can submit the laptop and take my things too. I will be given one month's extra salary too. It felt like I got struck with a lightning. Everyone downstairs were happy , celebrating my gifts from my first job and I am on the terrace, standing silent. It was quite an irony. I am an emotional person , kudos to my mother's genes. It takes me less than a second to cry when I am hurt. That day too tears rolled out and my mother called me to come down for dinner. I did not want to ruin anything. And that was the first time that I wanted to cry loud but I couldn't. I slowly came down for dinner. Every one asked what was the call about? I told them nothing important, just work related . We sat for dinner and had lovely conversations. All the laughter and joy around that table. And my heart knew what was going inside. My parents were supposed to stay a week longer and I came back. I went to the office. Took everything and my cheque and left. That entire week when I was alone at home with no job to go but to stay, I promised myself that this last salary is the only cash I have and I need to find another , better job. I worked hard. Real hard. I also simultaneously joined bank classes to prepare for exams . I wanted a better job so badly that I had exhausted myself. My parents came back from the native and then questioned me about , why I am not going to office ? I told them and that day broke down. That day I cried my heart out. My father felt bad as he knew I left TCS job because I wanted to stay at home , near to him. He thought he was responsible for me going through all this. He wished he could have changed it. But this was my battle. After a month , I got an offer from another product based MNC. Much better than what I had. It all made me understand that my job is important to me and the place where I am now, I love my job. I love it the way I love my boyfriend. I know being in IT this may happen again and I am ready for it . But that night, I can never forget in my life. Edit- many people are asking me that did TCS fire me? No people. I never joined TCS. As joining was coming late so I tried my hand in other companies and this was a startup. I joined it thinking there will be lot to learn and I will get to stay at home. I had been staying away from my family since class 11.",

I said but its Sunday today, most probably all the shops would be closed today. He replied lets give it a try, don't know whether I would get time after this or not. He bought me a new HP laptop. 27 January,2014 - Monday morning my father dropped me to bus stand in car, while we were going to bus stand he told me to focus on my studies and to study hard. I entered the bus and was adjusting my bags and what I saw that he was looking at me like he was never going to see me again. Around 1 PM I got an unexpected call from my mother(my parents used to call me at night), she said your father isn't well, he's admitted in hospital. I was totally shocked because he was totally fine when he dropped me in morning. I packed my bag and went back home. I reached about at 5:30 PM to hospital and what I see while entering the gate of the hospital is that my father's colleague's were standing over there with a dull face and I was still unaware about what happened and I thought for a while why the hell are they standing like this? The moment I entered inside the hospital's building I saw my whole family was sitting over there, I was in great shock. I was totally stunned by looking towards my mother's face. And then I came to know that my father was in ICU fighting for his life. I don't know what happened to me at that time but I was totally in control and was telling each and every person over there that he would be fine. I went to ICU, he was put on ventilator and was still hardly breathing. I asked doctor about his condition but Doctor said the chances are only 10%. I didn't tell this thing to my mother, I knew he would die within an hour or two. I picked up my younger sister from home(She didn't even know what had happened, she was sitting at home and was listening to songs) and took her to hospital so that she could see him for the last time. I took my mother and sister to ICU, they came out crying badly, but still I lied to them telling that his condition is improved than earlier. I sent both of them back home. It was 9:30 PM, the doctor came out from ICU and said something to one of my relative and took him inside ICU. I heard a continuous beep  sound which we listen in the movies and I was now sure that he's no more. I hardly cried for 10-15 minutes. Went back home, didn't tell anyone that he is no more, slept with my mother. I was pretending to sleep but neither I slept nor my mother for the whole night, she was still in hope that she would see him tomorrow morning but she didn't know that she don't have to go to the hospital in morning to see him but his dead body would come to home in the morning. 28 January,2014 - It was 10 AM and my heart was still not ready to tell the truth to my mother and sister, but I had to tell them and finally I did. I don't know what was going into my mind my father's dead body was in front of me, everyone was crying at that time but I was just looking towards him like nothing would have happened. It was cremation time and I hardly cried for 5 minutes at that time also. I never thought that I would be this much strong in such circumstances. The Change : After this incident I decided to change my college and thought of getting admission in a government engineering college that was near to my home but it was bit difficult to get admission over there but I was confident that I would surely get admission over there. It was really a coincidence that I already filled the form for the JEE main exam. I told my mother that I want to change my college she was not ready for this, but somehow I convinced her. I gave exam last year scored very less marks but I was eligible to sit in the counselling. I didn't get a seat in the first three online rounds but I was still very confident that I would surely get admission in the spot round and I finally got the admission in Computer Science and Engineering in the spot round which was last round.I used to roam in the city earlier but now I just sit at home and spend time with my mother and sister or by studying.I was too careless earlier but due to this incident I'm no more careless but, sometimes I do become. :PI rarely spend money on extra stuff on which I used to spend on.Rather than enjoying a party with my friends, now I prefer to eat food made by my mother along with her.I wasn't an intelligent guy earlier,but now I'm working hard on studies and there's a lot improvement.I didn't had an aim earlier, but now I want to be a Software Developer at Microsoft and later want to start my own company.This brought me more close to my sister than earlier and too much close to my mother too.I came to know how the real world is like. No one gives a damn to you when you're in a problem. But everyone would run to you when you're happy/rich person.I came to know that 1 out of 50 friends is a true friend and now I don't have trust on anyone and I hardly trust on someone.As I came to know how the world is like, so I became totally Independent and do whatever I like. Now I don't care what the world speaks about me, I'm doing everything for myself, my mother and my sister. People will keep on saying wrong things about you, so simply just don't care about them.As of all this I don't have expectations from others.Thanks for reading :) EDIT: What I believe is there was a great power working on me at that time. The power of GOD.",

That hit on my eye hurt a lot so I bent down trying to recover from the hallucinations it was giving me. The three of them started hitting me on my back (yeah, cowards for hitting an temporarily blind guy). Within minutes I recovered and still taking hits. No use in taking hits I thought. Tried my luck swinging my arms around in a hope to find the guy's face. Eureka!! Bam! His nose gave some blood to the floor. Pumped up by this, I started hitting back, this time with confidence. Took some heavy pounding, gave back some. Came back home with a face that even I wont recognize. Mom gave me dinner (yelling at me at a high pitch) sister can't do anything else than say my mom to calm down and let me eat.  *doorbell rang* Policemen were on the door. they said \"we are taking your son to XX police station\". I washed my hands put on my shirt. One policeman kept his hand on my neck and we went to the jeep (whole neighborhood was watching). The guy who wore neat formals to college, who is not even seen playing gully cricket being dragged by police. Hopped in the jeep,  reached the police station. The senior's dad has filed a complaint that I assaulted his son. I managed to give a triumphant smile on him and cursed \"rich bastard!\". Policeman's lathi did some honors on my legs. I didnt even budge. Sister's friend came with her dad (dad is some politician). After twenty minutes C.S.R was filed against me and I was let go after signing a letter that I won't hit him again.  Came back home. This time I was not the same guy who left the apartment. Now I know how to hit back, how to face police man's beatings, how to sit next to a thief wearing just shorts and nothing on top, remain silent when cops make fun of me, remain silent when that rich asshole was laughing while writing a complaint against me, to turn my heart into stone.  I am different now and I love it.",

But after this incident I learned few things. 1)Eat what ever you get at home. 2) My dinner consists of 3-4 dishes. And there are people who just have 2 dishes. So be satisfied with what you get. 3)It is the mother who purposely eats slow to ensure her child's stomach is full. The aunty in the neighbor will not do that thing.

But that\u2019s not me \u2013 I\u2019m just not inclined to take other people\u2019s word for anything. Growing up in the church, yes, I was exposed to stories of golden plates and angelic visitations and visions and miracles at an early age \u2013 both at church and in family conversations \u2013 which indeed made it more likely that I would not dismiss such things out of hand, but I\u2019m still not the kind of person to accept anything, even the assertions of loved ones, and especially not anything that doesn\u2019t initially fit my everyday experience.  I have a bit of a skeptic\u2019s view of things, mandating that I ask questions trying to understand, seek verification, and reason it out for myself. Over the years I had heard the same things in our monthly Fast and Testimony Meetings: \u201cI know (emphasis on KNOW) that Jesus died for my sins,\u201d or \u201cI know that The Book of Mormon is true,\u201d or \u201cI know Joseph Smith was a prophet.\u201d I only remember bearing my testimony once as a child, and that was the day I was given the Gift of the Holy Ghost through the laying on of hands. I remember a feeling of euphoria I had never felt before when I heard the words \u201cReceive the Holy Ghost\u201d that felt like a rush of divine fire throughout my body, from head to toe \u2013 and felt I had to stand up and show my thanks to God, but I don\u2019t remember any more than that. I often wondered how many of those who said \u201cI KNOW\u2026\u201d really KNEW, because even then, I knew the difference between knowing something and believing something. At age 14, just before the start of 9th grade, I moved from Orem, Utah, to live with my Dad in Granada Hills, California. That September, I dutifully started getting up at 6am to attend early morning seminary, where we studied the New Testament. As I learned about the life of Jesus and His miracles, I began to question my beliefs for the first time. I wanted to answer for myself the question of \u201cWhat do I know and how do I know it? What should I believe and why?\u201d I can remember my thought processes clearly even today, because it was so important to me. It was a deeply held passion to know what was true and what was not \u2013 largely because I was asking myself, \u201cShould I live by the strict requirements of my parent\u2019s LDS faith and my upbringing, or make friends with the partying crowd instead?\u201d  I honestly wanted to know for myself so I didn\u2019t waste my life living by someone else\u2019s made-up rules, if that\u2019s all they were. I had run across Descartes, Aristotle, and other philosophers in some of my reading, so I decided to start with \u201cI think, therefore I exist\u201d in attempting to examine what I knew and how and why I knew it, and what I would have to chalk up to faith or mere belief. At the time, I did not really understand the difference between faith and belief, considering there to be only minor differences between the two, with both being inferior to actually knowing something. So as I began that audit of my belief system, I quickly came to the realization that \u201cI think, therefore I exist\u201d may very well be the end of perfect certainty for me, or for anyone for that matter, based solely on reason, observation, and our senses. I pondered at length the implications of a simple question\u201d \u201cwhat if I\u2019m just making everything up in my mind?\u201d without knowing that such a belief system is called solipsism. I turned over the possibilities in my mind for months \u2013 which in the end, simply left me more confused than I\u2019d ever been before, because it just didn't fit the reality of my daily experience. I had come to a few conclusions on my own over my \u201cyear of critical unbelief.\u201d I had concluded that it was ridiculous to think that my mind was indeed \u201cmaking everything up,\u201d or that my own awareness of them was the source of all things, because only the interaction of other similar beings or intelligences could create the enormous variety of people and life and the surprises and mysteries I had encountered in my life. So I concluded that not only did I exist, but also that there were others who existed independent of me, and that there is an objective reality independent of my own mind. All of my experience remains consistent with that knowledge, and to imagine otherwise seems to me to be a fools errand. I had also concluded that our senses, while unreliable in many ways, lead all of these independent minds/awarenesses/intelligences \u2013 even animals \u2013 to accept certain \u201cfacts\u201d and evidences such that no one ever disputes them and all act as if those things are undeniably true.  Such things as the passage of time, the reality of objects we encounter daily, the need to eat, breathe, and sleep, the value of language, and so on \u2013all fit into this category of knowledge. Thus, I say that I \u201cknow\u201d a lot about the characteristics of things, because my perception of things matches perfectly the way others perceive them as well, judging from how they act. There is simply no cause to ever dispute them. And through all of this \u2013 and I know this will sound a bit strange to non-believers \u2013 it really never occurred to me to question whether Jesus Christ was my Savior or not. I automatically included that in my mind as something I simply knew, based on the reality that I understood \u2013 historical, experiential, testimonial, and scriptural. It still seems to me self-evident that there is good and evil, right choices and wrong choices, and that all of us make wrong choices to varying degrees and thus need a Savior. But everything else - especially my LDS beliefs about the church, Joseph Smith, and The Book of Mormon - I held in \u201csuspended belief,\u201d because I had no compelling reason to either disbelieve them or believe them. After those many months of intellectual struggle, however, I was even more dismayed about whether I could ever \u201cKNOW\u201d anything well enough to devote my life to it rather than merely doing whatever I wanted to do with the rest of my life. I began to despair, and because I was a normal teenager who found himself trying to find his place in a new home with a new group of friends in a new school, I was feeling pretty depressed about almost everything. By then, I had started the 2nd year of seminary, studying The Book of Mormon. The teacher had introduced us to a scripture I had heard before, but never paid serious attention to, and asked us to learn for ourselves whether The Book of Mormon was true and of God. The scripture was this:\u201cAnd when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.\u201d \u2013 Moroni 10:4-5 This time when I read it, it made me stop and think. I paid more attention to that word \u201cknow\u201d than I ever had before. If what I was reading was true \u2013 that I could know the truth of all things by the power of the Holy Ghost \u2013 then I recognized this promise could very well be the key of all knowledge, understanding, faith, and inspiration. Perhaps more importantly, I recognized that if The Book of Mormon really were true, then that was like the first domino in a string of dominoes. If The Book of Mormon were true, then Joseph Smith had to be a true prophet to bring it forth. If Joseph Smith was a true prophet, then his visions and the visitations of angels he experienced were true. If his visions are true, then Christ had restored His true gospel in these latter days, and the Church He had established while He walked the earth had been re-established in 1830 through Joseph Smith. Now I don't expect you to believe the following story, and I share it only because I'm willing to defend it and feel compelled to share it in answer to your question. But I remember it and even the details behind it vividly. One night, I was reading from The Book of Mormon trying to understand it, but not being that successful - I could understand the words, but they were somewhat confusing. I began to wonder if perhaps my confusion was evidence that the book was indeed from supernatural sources, but from the devil and not God. As I entertained that line of reasoning, I heard a voice coming from within the room. I couldn\u2019t understand what it was saying, but it was clear and stern. Startled, I looked up and could see the voice was coming from one of the two disconnected speakers on the floor. I had been working on fixing my stereo system, and had disconnected both speakers and left them on the floor. At that moment, as I realized that it was supernatural for disconnected speakers to be talking to me, I felt paralyzed by fear. I began to understand the voice, which was telling me that I had to beware and that I was one of the very elect and that I was about to be deceived and that I should burn The Book of Mormon and never touch one again, because it would lead me far astray from the knowledge I sought.  Then the other speaker repeated the same thing. During this time, I tried to scream, but couldn\u2019t make a sound. I tried to move, but couldn\u2019t. After the voices ended, in my bathroom, the toilet flushed. I tried to pray, but couldn\u2019t even think straight. I\u2019ve never again felt as terrified as I felt that night. When I could move again, I literally fell over to fall off the bed onto my knees, and prayed like I had never prayed before \u2013 but it was a clumsy prayer in that all I could think of praying for was relief and escape from the fear. I fell asleep praying and awoke the next morning still on my knees with my torso and arms sprawled on the bed. The next day, I could barely think of anything except what had happened to me. Had that been the promised manifestation? I was now not only totally confused, but also keenly aware that I could no longer enjoy the luxury of imagining there to be no God. If that had been God speaking to me from the speakers, then my fear was evidence of my unworthiness. If that had been an evil spirit speaking to me from the speakers, then my fear was justified. But I didn\u2019t know what to believe, even though it seemed to me more likely for that experience to have been of evil, similar to what Joseph Smith had experienced before His vision. I was afraid to tell anyone about my experience \u2013 and, in fact, have only told a handful of people about that experience since it happened and before I published it on my blog. After that, I was reading The Book of Mormon in earnest, almost daily; pondering how sincere my heart was, and whether I had real intent or faith in Christ, and wondering where it all would lead and whether I had already received the promised manifestation, and if so, what to make of it. All I remember about my reading is that it was difficult to understand and much of it seemed irrelevant to me. But I persevered, because the stakes had suddenly become even more incredibly high. I don\u2019t know how long it took me to get to Alma 32, but I remember the experience of reading that chapter with total clarity. In it, Alma, circa 74 B.C. in the Americas, is preaching the word of God to the people, in their synagogues and homes.  He begins to have success among the poor \u2013 those who had been cast out because \u201cof the coarseness of their apparel,\u201d \u201cbeing esteemed by their brethren as dross.\u201d Alma notes, however, that they \u201cwere poor in heart.\u201d  So when some of these poor begin to ask Alma plaintive questions about they should do since they have been cast out of the very synagogues that they have labored to build, Alma literally turns his attention from the rich and proud and begins to preach to the poor and humble. And gradually as I read, it seemed more and more as if Alma was talking directly to me. He talked about how blessed are those who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble, and about faith. As Alma says, \u201cthere are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.\u201d Alma continues to discuss faith, belief, and knowledge. \u201cNow I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.\u201d Alma suddenly seemed to be talking about my passion to know, and my struggle to know, and my reluctance to believe \u2013 and had my full attention as I carefully read on. I remember how powerfully the words affected me. \u201cAnd now as I said concerning faith\u2014faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.\u201d \u201cAnd now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word\u2026\u201d \u201cNow, as I said concerning faith\u2014that it was not a perfect knowledge\u2014even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.\u201d \u201cBut behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.\u201d Now I had done enough science experiments to be able to relate to Alma\u2019s talk about an experiment. I read on, enthralled by what I was reading. \u201cNow, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves\u2014It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.\u201d That struck me as self-evidently obvious, but it wasn\u2019t until I read the following that I had a transcendent spiritual experience: \"And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own alikeness. Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.\" \"And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.\" \"And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.\" \"O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good\u2026\u201d As I read those words of that last verse, I felt something that simply cannot be described in words. It was not only an incredible epiphany and sense of euphoria, but the same feeling I had felt at age 8 when confirmed \u2013 but more powerful this time.  Time stopped, as my entire body tingled with a spiritual energy \u2013 a fire \u2013 that felt as if my blood had become fire as it coursed through my body. There was a tingling energy that accompanied the fire, and my mind experienced a heightened awareness and certainty that is literally indescribable and cannot be communicated to someone who has not felt it, but need not be communicated to someone who has felt it. I suddenly KNEW \u2013 with that indescribably joyful certainty that includes, but is stronger than, fact and reason combined \u2013 not only that The Book of Mormon was true, but that God lived, my family and friends were not figments of my imagination but were children of God, and most importantly, that Jesus Christ was my Savior. All at the same time, with no doubt or fear \u2013 just a thrill of joy. I realized with joy, in and through that inspired state of heightened enlightenment where everything is crystal clear in an infinite instant, that throughout my life The Book of Mormon and Joseph Smith and the Church of Jesus Christ and the Gospel of Jesus Christ had brought me nothing but peace, joy, light, and goodness \u2013 and that equated with TRUTH. The doubts and fears were all mine and mine alone. Everyone I knew in the church were better people when they were living according to the principles taught by The Book of Mormon and the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I instantly recognized the many ways that I had been blessed by the love and goodness and inspired teachings of my family, neighbors, church members, teachers, Boy Scout leaders, and church leaders and General Authorities \u2013 the apostles and prophets \u2013 and I suddenly KNEW, in a way that I could never again doubt or deny \u2013 that I was feeling the Spirit of God \u2013 the Holy Ghost \u2013 and that THIS was the way, and the ONLY way, to \u201cknow the TRUTH of all things.\u201d What\u2019s more, I knew that my previous experience had been an encounter with evil. The contrast between the terror of that night and the peace and joy of this night could not have been more stark, and all doubt about what is true and good and what is not was eliminated for me in that infinite moment of sublime enlightenment. My prayers had been answered. I don\u2019t know how long I was caught up in the euphoria of that moment of supreme ecstasy and sublime knowing \u2013 but I do know that the experience changed me forever. I have felt that Spirit many times in my life now, and hunger for it and seek after it with all my heart. My late good friend, Britt Hagen, joined the church in his 40s, only a year or so before his death in 1997 and after a miraculous conversion experience somewhat similar to mine that I was privileged to share with him. He once told me that in his life prior to his conversion, he had tried almost every drug he could find \u2013 and that none could begin to compare with his experience with the Spirit of God. He had felt the same things I had, and knew the same things I knew. In fact, I\u2019ve known hundreds and even thousands and perhaps tens of thousands of people who have had the same experience with the Spirit \u2013 and all of them will tell you that it changes their lives. Many experience it before their baptism and are then baptized and become faithful converts. Some like me experience it after their baptism and are then willing to wear out their lives seeking to follow its promptings wherever it leads, trying to become \u2013 in Britt\u2019s words \u2013 a good man, one day at a time (knowing that none of us are or can be good in this life) while sharing its joy with others. Now, instead of looking strictly to fact, reason, science and consensus as being the best ways to know truth, I look to the Spirit of God as being the best way to know truth. It has never been wrong or led me astray, even though it is more often than not silent and absent, perhaps because, as Jesus said: \u201cThe wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.\u201d So here is what I now KNOW by the Spirit of God: I know God lives, and loves us, and wants us to love one another. I know that God sheds forth His Holy Spirit upon those of us, His children, who hunger and thirst after righteousness. I know Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and my Savior and the Savior of all mankind. I know The Bible and The Book of Mormon contain the word of God. I know God also speaks to His children through prophets, both ancient and modern, and also through the Spirit of God \u2013 a spark of which is given to everyone born on earth. I know the Gospel of Jesus Christ is true \u2013 that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, all mankind are saved from death and will be resurrected, and all can be saved from their sins, through obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel. I know my son Michael, my daughter Ashley, my sister Sherry, my brother Randy, and my grandparents and other ancestors are all in the spirit world, teaching and learning, and that I will enjoy a glorious reunion with them. I know relationships are eternal because \"love never ends.\u201d How do I know these things? Through the process I described above \u2013 not only through study and fact and reason, which I still value highly - but also by the Spirit of God \u2013 which is the most powerful form of knowing I can imagine. Now, in saying that, I need to address my skeptical friends who are atheists and agnostics \u2013 because I know they\u2019re likely to be thinking, \u201cHow can you say that? The scientific method is the best (and perhaps only) way to know anything.\u201d My response is that even though I\u2019m not a scientist, I believe I understand and actually believe in the scientific method. As I understand it, it\u2019s a means of discovery of truth consisting of systematic observation, careful measurement, repeated testing and experimentation, and the constant re-examination and modification, as necessary, of hypotheses and beliefs. That exactly describes the process I have used to KNOW those things. I have used the essentials of the scientific method religiously (irony fully intended) to sort out what is true from what is false and misleading. Even after my spiritual experiences described above, I\u2019ve been careful to keep re-examining my assumptions, knowing that my spiritual awakening was not the end of the road. It was a second birth, and just like a baby, I felt the need to learn more \u2013 much more. Every experience I\u2019ve had \u2013 even those where I took a detour off the paths of righteousness \u2013 have strengthened both my knowledge AND my faith. I\u2019ve put God and His messengers and the truth He has revealed to the test, time and time again. I may fail them \u2013 but they\u2019ve never failed me. When I live according to the Spirit and the guidance I get from the word of God, I enjoy peace in times of trial and joy in times of abundance. I am a better man for it. When I forget God for awhile, whether it\u2019s hours or days or even weeks, and live by my own light or let my innate pride and self-righteousness rule my will (which happens often to me, as anyone who follows me in my Facebook group postings can attest), I can be mean, short-tempered, and irritable and then pay the price by reaping what I\u2019ve sown. And as I learned from Alma 32, whatsoever is true is good and light and discernible and enlightens the soul. I don\u2019t doubt that \u2013 and it guides my every decision about what is right and what is wrong. Have I seen God? No. But I have seen the workings of God in the lives of His children, both through outright miracles and the less dramatic tender mercies, so many times that I would be a craven fool to deny it, just as someone would be a fool who denies the results of an experiment he\u2019s seen repeated a thousand times \u2013 with the exact same results repeated every time. And that ignores the accumulation of historical fact, philosophical perspectives, observations of human nature, natural and supernatural phenomenon, and even the inspiring art and beauty we all encounter in our lives \u2013 all of which combine to reinforce as strongly as anything else I know \u2013 my knowledge that God lives; God is good; God is love; and everything else I know about God and His Son, Jesus Christ, and about His Gospel and Church. Knowledge may be power, but more importantly it is a means to the end of a perfect and fulfilling joy, throughout this life and the eternities to come. So that is why I am convinced of \"Mormonism\" - although I must point out that \"Mormonism\" is simply a small piece of God's workings among the children of men according to their faith in God and his Son, Jesus Christ. And whenever you have men trying to do their best to do God's will, you have very human frailties, weaknesses, and failings. Which is why The Book of Mormon includes the admonition to not mistake the things of man for the things of God. So it is not Joseph Smith or \"Mormonism\" I worship - only God our Eternal Father and His Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost. And I marvel at their wisdom in giving each of us the gift of sure knowledge to know \"the truth of all things\" if we but humble ourselves before God and seek his Holy Spirit in all sincerity and faith.",

ThroughouContinue ReadingI grew up in Canada\u2019s largest Protestant church (United Church of Canada), widely regarded as the most liberal Christian denomination in the world. When my parents stopped attending as we children got older, I started avidly watching and fervently praying along with televangelists each Sunday. For years, I also earnestly prayed along with radio preachers before going to school each morning. However, no matter how much faith I exerted with every fibre of my being, I wasn\u2019t blessed at that time with a born-again experience as they had kept promising. Yet, I never ceased to yearn for it. Throughout junior and senior high school, I deeply immersed myself in what much later became known as New Age content, including reading a lot of books about Edgar Cayce\u2019s clairvoyant readings, which prompted me to adopt reincarnation as my core belief. During that period, I delved deeply into Hindu scripture such as the Bhagavad Gita, as well as the Tao Te Ching and various Zen Buddhist texts largely written by D. T. Suzuki and further elucidated by Alan Watts, all converging into my practice of an eclectic form of Taoist Zen Buddhism mixed with S\u014dka Gakkai (aka SGI). Eventually, after having exhausted my fascinating involvement with the major Eastern religions and with Western existentialism, I went on to study and attend the meetings of all the Christian sects and denominations that I could find, including the ubiquitous Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, comparing their various beliefs and practices and, to a lesser degree, their histories as well as those of their founders and reformers. Notwithstanding all of that, I\u2019d already gone through a Salt Lake City Temple Square tour much earlier when I was 11 years old and was fully convinced by the presentations there that Joseph Smith had indeed experienced a glorious vision of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, that the Angel Moroni had appeared to him in preparation to reveal The Book of Mormon, that the resurrected Christ had definitely visited the ancient Americas, and that Joseph Smith had translated The Book of Mormon into English through divine inspiration. Despite all of that, without any reinforcing contact with missionaries or other Latter-day Saints, those strong impressions gradually faded due to neglect for years. Yet, I never stopped believing. In fact, when I started university, I brought the copy of The Book of Mormon we\u2019d gotten at Salt Lake City to my dormitory because I still felt those same precious impressions rekindled whenever I read a few lines in it seven years later. At university, I ended up sharing an apartment with a recently returned missionary, who soon introduced me to the young missionaries on campus. I was baptized two very long weeks later, largely because I\u2019d felt the power of that same sweet Spirit from years earlier and had been overwhelmed by the amazing love that the university congregation members sincerely shared with each other and genuinely expressed toward me. As for beliefs, I recognized that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints taught the truly restored gospel of Jesus Christ because \u2026Instead of paradoxically teaching that God is an incomprehensible, passionless, impersonal, nebulous spirit essence that fills the universe but at the same time exists only in the hearts of true believers\u2014claims unsupportable by the Bible\u2014it taught exactly as the Bible depicts: that He is a very tangible, personal, loving God who indeed does have passions (emotion).Instead of trying to engage in mental gymnastics to defend the unsupportable Trinity theory through a series of logical fallacies, with a final concession that God is simply incomprehensible, it taught as is so abundantly clear throughout the New Testament that the Father and Son are physically separate Beings united in purpose, character, attributes, and perfections, very much in keeping with the Lord\u2019s admonition that His Saints be one just as He and the Father are one\u2014an admonition that we be knit together in love, not that we somehow transform into enormous chimeras.Instead of the illogical claim that we suddenly flare into existence out of nothingness at birth, it taught that we are all Heavenly Father\u2019s spirit sons and daughters who progressively learned, loved, and grew in His divine presence for an immeasurable time before the creation of the Earth. Because of that spiritual heritage, we each have the potential to become increasingly more like Him, which is the entire purpose of Christ\u2019s gospel, though of course not equal with Him. That premortal life explained both (1) the inequity and injustice of some people\u2019s birth into wretched circumstances and (2) why so many near-death experiencers feel they\u2019ve returned to a long-forgotten but familiar spiritual home after they\u2019ve left their physical bodies during their temporary death.Instead of claiming that we are all tainted by Original Sin from the time of birth, it much more reasonably taught that we are responsible only for how we exercise our agency and that children who die without having been baptized remain naturally innocent of sin. Instead of teaching arbitrary predestination, which can be seen only as a fate imposed by an unjustly malevolent Deity, it taught about the perfect foreknowledge of an infinitely loving God, who omnisciently foresees the eternal destiny of His spirit children without violating their free will either to exercise faith or to reject Christ through their own volition.Instead of the incredibly simplistic, nonsensical belief that there\u2019s a thin line separating all people in the Final Judgement, dividing their ultimate fates into the polar opposites of an incredibly blissful heaven on the one hand and an incomprehensibly tormenting hell on the other hand, merely by their [1] being vaguely good and/or believing in Jesus (whatever that may entail for mainline Protestants), [2] accepting Jesus into their hearts (whatever that even means for evangelicals), or [3] receiving all seven authorized sacraments (for Catholics), it much more reasonably taught that there are many mansions prepared within several Kingdoms of Glory as well as one realm of Outer Darkness to accommodate the vast range of faith and faithfulness (righteousness) as well as the diverse shades of wickedness that characterize human beings. It clearly taught about our passing into the Spirit World after death and then awaiting our own physical resurrection during the Millennium after which there will be a Final Judgement, long after the preliminary Life Review described by many near-death experiencers.Instead of focusing entirely on the cross, which would make the Saviour\u2019s sacrifice virtually indistinguishable from the deaths of so many others who had been crucified, it taught that much of the infinite atonement was accomplished in the Garden of Gethsemane when the Lord suffered the full weight of all the sins of mankind mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually to the extent that blood was excruciatingly forced through every pore of His body as described in the New Testament, an important detail ignored by all other denominations. It also taught that He further suffered the combined anguish of all the pain and suffering that we and all our descendants will ever suffer in mortality as if He were enduring them personally Himself, making Him perfectly compassionate toward us for all the pain, heartbreak, injustices, and distress that any and all of us will ever endure in this life.It taught that Christ had been physically resurrected and still retains that perfect body of flesh and bones to this day, which makes the Trinity theory fundamentally impossible, as the Bible doesn\u2019t state anywhere that He later shed that perfected body after His ascension, a body with which He had actually eaten fish and honeycomb together with His disciples.It taught about the divine equanimity of proxy baptism for the dead as performed in sacred temples reminiscent of those in ancient Israel, each reverently known as the House of the Lord. This demonstrates the perfect reconciliation of God\u2019s justice and mercy. I\u2019d already met too many evangelical Christians who insisted that Hindus and Buddhists as well as anyone who\u2019d lived before Christ\u2019s ministry were all unfortunately doomed to the torments of hell, possibly because of their indoctrination in the indefensible Lutheran idea of predestination.It taught that God loves His children enough not to cease communicating with us through ongoing personal revelation rather than abandoning us to the diverse (mis)interpretations of an obviously incomplete Bible compiled by imperfect human beings amidst fierce disputations about what should constitute scriptural canon.It taught that God is unchanging and therefore continues to guide Christ\u2019s established kingdom through prophets and apostles as He has always done from the time of Adam. He would not be the author of chaos as embodied by the myriad of fundamentally conflicting Christian denominations or of the almost unlimited number of conflicting interpretations of the Bible. He loves us enough to continue to guide us through His servants\u2014prophets, apostles, seventies, bishops, elders, priests, and deacons\u2014as described in the New Testament.It taught about the \u201cbelieving blood\u201d of scattered Israel, which The Book of Mormon was designed to help gather in these latter days. This was important to me because I\u2019d attended a largely Jewish high school and was preoccupied with the idea of a Chosen People. To compensate for my \u2018unfortunate\u2019 Gentile birth, I\u2019d studied Hebrew on my own, memorizing long passages of the Torah with Sephardic pronunciation. Thus, I was thrilled afterward to discover from my patriarchal blessing that I wasn\u2019t really a Gentile after all.It wisely combined the evangelical belief of faith in Christ, the mainline Protestant belief in being good, the Catholic belief in receiving authorized priesthood ordinances (including biblical baptism by full water immersion as well as the laying-on-of-hands for confirmation and conferral of the gift of the Holy Ghost), the Jewish emphasis on entering into sacred covenants, etc., all into one unified whole in accordance with the fulness of the Bible instead of selecting only fragmented parts and ignoring the rest. It resolved the faith versus works controversy by clarifying that neither one could ever exist without the other.It had published The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, which honest truth seekers must conclude could have been written only by a divinely inspired prophet, wonderfully clarifying both the Old and New Testaments with which it is fully consistent. I have received multiple spiritual confirmations regarding its truthfulness and continue to draw increasingly nearer to Christ because of it.The Latter-day Saints actually practiced what they taught with particular emphasis on compassionate charity to the extent that most people say that \u201cMormons\u201d are the nicest, most honest people they\u2019ve ever met. After all, Christ declared in allegory that we may accurately judge a tree by its fruits, and Latter-day Saints produce the sweetest fruit I\u2019ve ever seen or tasted, evidence that the Holy Spirit is active in their lives and still directs the restored Church of Jesus Christ today.Furthermore, as already stated above, I knew to the core of my being that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ had appeared to the young Joseph Smith, as had the Angel Moroni, as well as John the Baptist, and Peter, James, and John. That impression was so strong that I could not deny the reality of those appearances or the importance of the eternal truths and keys of holy priesthood authority that they restored to the earth after a clearly evident Great Apostasy. Moreover, as also mentioned above, I witnessed an amazing, genuine love flowing between and among the Latter-day Saint university students who sincerely cared for each other and about me. At the time of my baptism at age 19, I did fortunately experience a glorious spiritual rebirth when I was infused with the warm liquid light of the Holy Spirit from the crown of my head to the tips of my toes, after which I was filled with a profound unconditional love for everyone and everything for several weeks, and likewise was imbued with a perceptible spiritual light (an actual glow) for months afterwards until I went on to serve my own mission in Japan as a volunteer missionary at ages 21 to 23. Despite my unanswered efforts throughout childhood, I finally did obtain that much-longed-for born-again experience at the time of my baptism and confirmation as a young adult, and I\u2019ll never regret that most important of all choices in my life. If you\u2019d like to discover what we really believe, I recommend that you investigate directly for yourself instead of placing your trust in the inherently biased distortions that nonbelievers convey about us. I\u2019ve compiled a list of links to help facilitate your independent study:Kenneth Wedin \u00b7 3yWhat is the quickest and easiest way to find out what Latter-day Saints (Mormons) believe if I want to learn their theology?In addition to directing you either to ComeUntoChrist.org or to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, many Latter-day Saints recommend reading The Articles of Faith, The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles, The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World, and The Family: A Proclamation to the World. My own conversion came immediately as a result of The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith, which now has an associated webpage regarding the Restoration , followed by my reading of The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ as well as my experience of being loved unconditionally by young Latter-day Saints whom I\u2019d just met. It\u2019s more important to meet with missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who can answer your questions and encourage you to read The Book of Mormon as well as to pray about it so that you can obtain an answer for yourself about its veracity directly from the Lord. However, because restrictions relevant to COVID-19 may delay such a meeting, if you don\u2019t want to wait, you can read the lessons that missionaries actually teach from Preach My Gospel: A Guide to Missionary Service: The Message of the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, The Plan of Salvation, The Gospel of Jesus Christ, The Commandments, Laws and Ordinances. Each of these five lessons is supplemented by a study guide: The Restoration (The Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Heavenly Father Reveals His Gospel, Jesus Christ Established His Church, The Great Apostasy, The Restoration of the Gospel, The Restoration of the Priesthood, The Book of Mormon, How Can I Know?), The Plan of Salvation (The Plan of Salvation, Where Did I Come From?, What Is My Purpose in Life?, Where Will I Go After This Life?, What Does the Plan Mean for Me?, How Can I Know?), The Gospel of Jesus Christ (The Gospel of Jesus Christ, Faith in Jesus Christ, Repentance, Baptism and the Holy Ghost, Enduring to the End, How Can I Know?), Chastity (Chastity, What Is the Law of Chastity?, Why Should I Keep the Law of Chastity?, How Do I Keep the Law of Chastity?, Blessings of Living the Law of Chastity), Tithing and Fast Offerings (Tithing and Fast Offerings, What Is Tithing?, Why Should I Contribute Tithing?, How Are Tithing Funds Used?, Fasting and Fast Offerings), Word of Wisdom (The Word of Wisdom, What Is the Word of Wisdom?, Blessings of the Word of Wisdom, A Word of Wisdom, Giving Up Harmful Substances), Learning and Serving in the Church, Families and Temples. Newly baptized Church members and families are encouraged to read the Gospel Principles manual, a good resource for individuals and families to review the most fundamental beliefs and practices in a logically progressive order. It includes the following topics: Our Father in Heaven, Our Heavenly Family, Jesus Christ, Our Savior, Freedom to Choose, The Creation, The Fall of Adam and Eve, The Holy Ghost, Praying to Our Heavenly Father, Prophets of God, Scriptures, The Life of Christ, The Atonement, The Priesthood, Priesthood Organization, The Lord\u2019s Covenant People, The Church of Jesus Christ in Former Times, The Church of Jesus Christ Today, Faith in Jesus Christ, Repentance, Baptism, The Gift of the Holy Ghost, The Gifts of the Spirit, The Sacrament, The Sabbath Day, Fasting, Sacrifice, Work and Personal Responsibility, Service, The Lord\u2019s Law of Health, Charity, Honesty, Tithes and Offerings, Missionary Work, Developing Our Talents, Obedience, The Family Can Be Eternal, Family Responsibilities, Eternal Marriage, The Law of Chastity, Temple Work and Family History, The Postmortal Spirit World, The Gathering of the House of Israel, Signs of the Second Coming, The Second Coming of Jesus Christ, The Millennium, The Final Judgment, Exaltation. High school students attend seminary classes each weekday to study each book of scripture, but they also review core doctrine in the Doctrinal Mastery Core Document, which covers the following topics: The Godhead, The Plan of Salvation, The Atonement of Jesus Christ, The Restoration, Prophets and Revelation, Priesthood and Priesthood Keys, Ordinances and Covenants, Marriage and Family, Commandments. In addition to studying books of scripture and the teachings of presidents of the Church, university/college students taking Institute of Religion courses can study the Doctrines of the Gospel Student Manual, which outlines these eternal truths in logical order: Divine Truth, Revelation: Avenue to Truth, God the Eternal Father, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, The Holy Ghost, Our Premortal Life, The Creation, The Fall, The Atonement of Jesus Christ, The Purpose of Earth Life, The Agency of Man, Prayer and Fasting, Faith, a Power That Centers in Christ, Repentance, The Covenant of Baptism, The Gift of the Holy Ghost, Obedience, a Law of Heaven, Spiritual Rebirth: True Conversion, Eternal Life, The Sacrament, a Memorial Ordinance, The Foreordination of Covenant Israel and Their Responsibilities, The Apostasy, The Restoration of the Gospel in the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times, The Scattering and the Gathering of Israel, Priesthood: What It Is, How It Works, The Oath and Covenant of Priesthood, The Law of the Sabbath, Celestial Marriage, The Importance of the Family, Death and the Postmortal Spirit World, The Redemption of the Dead, The Resurrection and the Judgment, Kingdoms of Glory and Perdition, The Signs of the Times, The Fall of Babylon and the Establishment of Zion, The Lord\u2019s Second Coming, The Millennium and the Glorification of the Earth. Anyone having questions afterwards about more specific topics can read further from the Gospel Topics resource on the Church website. For something a little more in-depth, you could read entries in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism: The History, Scripture, Doctrine, and Procedure of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The most profound two books that I read while waiting to serve as a volunteer missionary shortly after my own baptism were Lectures on Faith and Jesus the Christ: A Study of the Messiah and His Mission according to Holy Scriptures both Ancient and Modern, which I highly recommend more than consulting the aforementioned encyclopedias. Some may even want to read further to see what subsequent Church presidents have had to say about each of the topics listed above by reading various Teachings of Presidents of the Church manuals. Those interested in Church history can read the new narrative history, Saints: The Story of the Church of Jesus Christ in the Latter Days, which is surprisingly frank and honest about the controversial matters on which critics of the Church like to focus attention. Besides content on the official website of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which also has apps for your electronic devices, there are numerous books online at GospeLink and Deseret Book, which both charge monthly subscriptions, but they should be a much later consideration. I would certainly seek knowledge directly from actual believers. After all, one would not want to rely on what a Protestant has to say about Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy, or what a Catholic may have to say about Protestantism or evangelical/charismatic Christianity. Needless to say, none of these groups could give an accurate, unbiased account of what Latter-day Saints, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Christian Scientists, or Unitarians believe or practice."
