            "essentially you want to report a person a missing a soon a youre sure their absence is suspicious i believe that in the old day 24 hour wa a reasonable benchmark for that which is where this myth came from but nowadays with instant global communication being unreachable for one hour can be just a much cause for concern a being unreachable for 24 if you have reason to think a person ha disappeared especially if that person is underage dont wait for the sake of waiting to report it",

            "you should also know that the police dgaf about you and will tell you otherwise and refuse to do anything",
            "i wa under the impression this myth wa started by the mob because they know the first 48 hour are the most crucial in a missing person case",
            "same applies in the uk too",
            "i hope this applies everywhere those first 2448 hour are the most important in finding someone",
            "i know this is the case but ive still seen too many documentary and listened to too many podcasts where the police are insistent the friendsfamily have to wait a certain amount of time before filing a report",
            "this is very true and good to know my grandpa went missing recently and even though it is standard that a missing person phone cannot be tracked by the cell tower in my state request it anyway because he wa pretty old there wa a judge who ruled an exception and it wa instrumental in finding him to every individual officer who helped u out and sacrificed their thanksgiving my whole family appreciates how patient kind and caring you were",
            "ive preached this to my wife for year several year ago we had a man close to home that went missing and search and rescue wasnt called until the next morning the poor fellow passed in the early morning hour due to exposure i wa camping at a national park in california i used my satellite communicator to let her know where i wa going for a sunset hike since my partner had not yet arrived at the campground i returned to camp and sent her a message but unfortunately the message did not send and i got distracted since my friend wa at camp sometime after midnight the park ranger come to our campsite and start shaking tent it took 5 hour to get ahold of the proper authority and get the search started lessons learned were to leave the phone number for the authority in the region you are going to adventure in my case this would have started the search 25 hour sooner",
            "so many people believe you have to wait even tv show perpetuate it it never help to delay finding someone",
            "at least 24 hour id have thought  you really should be carrying enough spare stuff to be at least one day delayed or an unplanned overnight on a long day walk without an issue that doe then tend to leave a truly vast search area the search  rescue beacon  satellite phone option that you can activate yourself to fetch help do seem like a better solution overall"

unspeakably rich enough to set you up for life on one of the few remaining garden worlds or functional ecuminopoli of course that is if the buyer doesnt kill you the arcane piece of tech doesnt get confiscated by some threesystems warlord or if you dont accidentally wind up destroying it yourself somehow many a scavenger team ha found a garden world creation kit only to accidentally boot it up during transit destroying their ramshackle ship and killing them in the process many have accidentally found what might have been an advanced piece of medical tech only to discover too late that their ship is overrun with necrosynthetic antibioweapons to say nothing of the horror there is in finding that what you thought wa a zeropoint generator wa actually a dimensional anchor and by deactivating it for transportation you find that the whole moon you and your team wa working on got sent back to a different universe one that can best be described a eternal torment its a very dangerous line of work but the reward are immense and most scavenger or freelance archaeologists a the more welleducated scavvers like to call themselves agree that the sheer freedom of not being bound to one interstellar warlordstate is well worth the risk of course there is a way to decrease the risk a way to make the odds biased in your favour and oddly enough it to have a small group of human with you they say that if you want to find out what some ancient mysterious piece of tech doe without getting dnareprogrammed into a pile of your microbiological ancestor you should seek out a human and let them handle it they have a truly uncanny ability of making sense of and safely using ancient and dangerous technology often if you wish to harness the strange tech yourself they can turn it to do the most unexpected thing thing they were never programmed or built for of course there are problem with having the human helping you out like that they dont need a special atmosphere or a very restrictive diet hell they even work for fairly cheap the problem with human is a twofold one the first problem is to find them during the hyperwar their starsystem wa completely and utterly destroyed the cataclysmic battle often called the death of the gods wa fought there the human still in hushed tone tell tale of the day when the god died or a they called it ragnarok that wa the battle that ended the hyperwar destroying both warring side and leaving our galaxy in ruin countless trillion of life lost in a pointless nightmarish engagement that raged for a century only a small group of human were successfully evacuated before the battle began less than a hundred million human got off their homeworld before it wa atomized fewer still were safely out of the starsystem and with the chaos of that age human were spread thinly across the galaxy they became focused on keeping together with the people they could at all cost and not separate again like they had been separated from the one who were left behind on lost terra to this day they are a rare lot always travelling in clan or tribe never settling down or finding a world to call their own they fear the idea of getting stuck somewhere and some say that the ghost of extinction haunt the entire race making of them perpetual wanderer which make them difficult to track down for anyone who want to utilize their unique skill with arcane tech so if you actually manage to find a human to work with youre in luck your risk of getting your mind replaced with that of a precursor criminal after unsafely handling an ancient timeprison is now reduced to nearly zero the second problem is that the human do not travel alone when you hire one of them you hire their entire clan sometimes this is just a few dozen human but there are some scavvers who find themselves accidentally leading an entire fleet of human junkships tens of thousand of human and they havent got a stable and singular culture so you better make sure youre aware which clan belonging to which tribe that you hire because they get strange but you can always rest easy knowing that human deliver what you need someone who can safely decipher ancient manual figure out how to disable the puzzletraps and find the real artefact that give you a payday rather than the fake one which transmutes your ship into wood and in the end thats what matter sure you might wonder in amazement at the insane ingenuity of the qoban clan find yourself enrichened by the ancient culture of the frenjt clan or terrified by the ruthless efficiency of one of the many saksarus clan but no matter if they worship the tiny brick and ancient banner or if they pray to a god who demand that all flesh be covered in public they all start the same way of testing the ancient tech the human clan priest archivist technomancer or other important sociotechnological leader make all the human chant in one of the ancient dead language of lost terra then the sacred interfacing device is brought forth the pese copied and improved over the century from the few one brought with the original human off from their homeworld then the leader turn the pese on and off thrice before being satisfied then once the interfacing device ha made a connection to the arcane technology in question the sacred dongle is brought forth on it is one of the secret of humanity something that they claim have kept them alive taught them to fight the demon in the machine and ensured their survival the sacred dongle is then connected to the interfacing device these ritual can continue sometimes for day week even but when it is done the dongle is safely removed according to ancient protocol that is when a sentence ancient and spoken by all human in all their many strange language is shouted aloud so that all might hear i got this thing to run doom and this is the signal that human now can put this strange piece of technology under their and by extension your control of course if the ritual fails there is another that they will do but unlike the first one they dont speak of it nor let outsider see it all that is known of this is that the leading human will exclaim to their fellow in hushed tone we must release skyrim on this a strange lot but in a dark galaxy where a scavver is but one living soul amidst countless trillion where you can forget all about the promise of peace prosperity and progress where all that once wa seems lost and so much science and technology ha been forgotten now never to be recovered you can do a lot worse than having a small group of technologically savvy being like the human by your side and more often than not you get to experience the hidden benefit of human if you treat them fairly and with kindness they tend to become attached to you and they will consider you in some way to be family and they tend to be quite infectiously likeable too more than one crew of alien have joined the human on their endless wandering after they became fond of their wanderluststricken friend that being said now that youve got an answer to why all the good scavvers have human in their crew do you want to hire some because i know of a small clan about a hundred or so who arent currently employed by anyone theyre staying at a small moon in this system youll like them theyre a clan from the canuck tribe of human real friendly type polite too and theyre very good at working in lowtemperature condition all i need in exchange is well maybe a lift to the next starcluster warlord around here is getting too uppity for my taste you

            "treat apple like a desert the only good thing about apple is that they are not refined apples by themselves are not going to give you enough nutrition instead youll get mostly fructose you can get better nutrition from green vegetable the best thing you can consume and is made of apple is apple cider vinegar extremely good for your stomach acidity which help in iron absorption thats the only thing i would recommend consuming and is made out of apple",
            "apples and all fruit have been refined by human over many many year aiming for the sweetestmost delicious fruit to the point now where they are basically candy fruit in general is super tasty but is not the healthiest choice imo  way too much sugar",
