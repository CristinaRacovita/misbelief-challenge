            "When you swallow watermelon seeds, they typically pass through your digestive system without being digested. Most seeds will be eliminated from your body through your stool. It's a common myth that swallowed watermelon seeds will grow into a watermelon plant inside your body, but this is not true. The seeds need soil, water, and sunlight to germinate and grow into a plant.",

Our stomach acid and intestinal movements are strong enough to break down the tough outer shell of the seed, so it can't take root or grow inside of us. I learned this from personal experience after nervously watching for watermelons to sprout out of my belly after eating some as a kid! The seed might cause a little gastrointestinal discomfort when it passes, but it's very unlikely to cause any serious harm. Our digestive systems are built to handle the food we eat, even stray seeds or pits. Over the years, I\u2019ve swallowed watermelon seeds, cherry pits, and even an occasional olive pit by accident. I know many others who have as well, with no ill effects. So take a deep breath and don't worry! That watermelon seed will pass through and you'll be A-okay. Just be sure to chew your food thoroughly from now on to avoid swallowing seeds whole. And definitely don\u2019t try swallowing them on purpose, as a large quantity could potentially cause an obstruction. But an accidental seed here and there is nothing to lose sleep over. Your digestive system has totally got this!",

SF contended that the first fortune cookie was made at the Japanese Tea Garden in SF\u2019s Golden Gate Park and the maker was Makoto Hagiwara. LA on the other hand contended that the fortune cookie was created in 1918 by David Jung at the Hong Kong Noddle Factory. The Court was persuaded to accept the SF claim on three counts: there is a tradition of sandwiching fortunes in the fold of cookies (as opposed to enclosing the paper entirely with the cookie) in Japan (the cookie was known as tsujiura senbei (\u8fbb\u5360\u714e\u9905)) and there was no such tradition in China; the Japanese Tea Gardens existed before the Hong Kong Noodle Factory; and even if the Hong Kong Noodle Factory did produce the first fully enclosed fortune cookie, it was insufficiently different from tsujiura senbei to be called a distinct product. The argument before the Court highlighted several other things. First, the argument was important because it was an iconic American immigrant invention (meaning it did come from China or any other country). Second, just because it is iconic Chinese American does not mean the idea could not have been originated from another source. Meaning a Chinese did not have to invent a product for it to be an iconic Chinese product. Prior to the Second World War, Japanese businesses produced more fortune cookies than Chinese businesses, partly because there were more Japanese businesses in California. Having said that, many of these Japanese made cookies were sold to Chinese tea houses and restaurants who gave them as \u2018gifts\u2019 to patrons. Sadly, the internment of Japanese Americans and the destruction of their businesses during the war, meant that by 1946 most of the factories producing fortune cookies were owned by Chinese American. As for why other countries did not develop the fortune cookie can only be speculated. I believe there are three main reasons:Those countries with large Chinese populations (Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia etc) did not see the fortune cookie as being authentic Chinese cuisine and thus would never have invented or adopt it.Those countries with reasonably sized Chinese and Japanese immigrant populations, where the intermingling of cultures could have sparkled the invention, simply did not have a habit of eating cookies (e.g. Peru).Those countries with small Chinese immigrant populations simply were too small to develop iconic products. Australia - falls into this category. Even though Australia today has a large Chinese immigrant population, Australia had a white immigration policy prior to 1966. Despite being dismantled in 1966, it was not until the 1980s when the Chinese immigrant community began being significant.Meaning that the pre-conditions of having a sizeable Chinese and Japanese immigrant population plus a eating public that enjoyed biscuits only existed in the USA, thereby giving birth to the fortune cookie.",
            "Restaurants in China never offer any \"fortune cookies\". Chinese restaurants outside the U.S. do not offer fortune cookies either. Because \"fortune cookies\" are a product of the United States. Some restaurants in China offer a dessert at the end of the meal, such as bean curd flowers, turtle paste, sago pudding, etc. But they don't offer western style desserts like cookies and cakes, and most Chinese people don't like sweet things that much. Of course there are exceptions, such as my father, who eats almost 150 grams of sugar into his stomach every day.",

Makoto Hagiwara of Golden Gate Park's Japanese Tea Gardenin San Francisco is reported to have been the first person in the USA to have served the modern version of the cookie when he did so at the tea garden in the 1890s or early 1900s. The fortune cookies were made by a San Francisco bakery, Benkyodo. In 1989, fortune cookies were reportedly imported into Hong Kong and sold as \"genuine American fortune cookies\".Wonton Food attempted to expand its fortune cookie business into China in 1992, but gave up after fortune cookies were considered \"too American\".",

They are relatively niche, nowhere near the popularity they enjoy in the United States. Unlike American fortune cookies they are flavored with miso and sesame, and thus have much nuttier flavor than in those vanilla-butter ones in the United States. Today in Kyoto you still can see small family-run bakeries outside the Fushimi Inari Shrine making the fortune cookies by hand. If you go see them, the family resemblance is pretty strong. It's totally cool. They make then with small grills called kata. A Japanese scholar I found, Yasuko Nakamachi, was arguably the first person to make the case that the fortune cookies are from Japan. Her prime pieces of evidence are the Kyoto generations-old small family bakeries making obscure fortune cookie-shaped crackers. She has also turned up many references to the cookies in Japanese literature and history, including an 1878 image of a man making them in a bakery - decades before the first reports of American fortune cookies. Here is the 1878 image: So if fortune cookies are Japanese, how did they get associated with Chinese restaurants? Well, turns out the fortune cookie\u2019s path is relatively easy to trace back to World War II. At that time they were a regional specialty, served in California Chinese restaurants, where they were known as \u201cfortune tea cakes.\u201d There they were encountered by military personnel on the way back from the Pacific Theater. When the veterans returned home, they would ask their local Chinese restaurants why they didn\u2019t serve authentic fortune cookies as the San Francisco restaurants did. So the restaurants inquired west, and the cookies rapidly spread across the country. By the late 1950s, an estimated 250 million fortune cookies were being produced each year by dozens of small Chinese bakeries and fortune cookie companies. One of the larger outfits was Lotus Fortune in San Francisco, whose founder, Edward Louie, invented an automatic fortune cookie machine. By 1960, fortune cookies had become such a mainstay of American culture that they were used in two presidential campaigns: Adlai Stevenson\u2019s and Stuart Symington\u2019s.  A number of immigrant families in California, mostly Japanese, have laid claim to introducing or popularizing the fortune cookie prior to World War I. Among them are the descendants of Makoto Hagiwara, a Japanese immigrant who oversaw the Japanese Tea Garden built in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park in the 1890s. Another one is Fugetsudo in Los Angeles. Last year, some of the kata grills from Benkyodo were donated to the Smithsonian as part of Asian American collection. http://blog.americanhistory.si.edu/osaycanyousee/2010/07/origins-of-a-fortune-cookie.html So that period between World War I and World War II is murky.  This we know: during the 1920s and 1930s, many Japanese immigrants in California owned chop suey restaurants, which served Americanized Chinese cuisine. And early on, Chinese-owned restaurants discovered the cookies, too. But they were focused mostly in San Francisco, though with some evidence of the cookies being served in New York.  So what happened between World War I and World War II? Basically Franklin Delano Roosevelt's executive order 9066 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066, which rounded up the Japanese-Americans into internment camps, including those that made fortune cookies. As far as we can tell, during that period, the Chinese basically moved in on manufacturing the cookies, and by the end of World War II, they were known as Chinese fortune tea cakes. And they were made at scale. So I like to say fortune cookies were invented by the Japanese, popularized by the Chinese and ultimately consumed by Americans. If you want to see Chinese being confused by fortune cookies, I took a bunch of the cookies back to China and gave them out. Here is their reaction.  Small but little known fact. David Lee of SV Angel's father (who is Korean American) made the first fully automated fortune cookies machines in America.",
            "The History of the Fortune Cookie Much of what is passed off as \u201cChinese food\u201d in the West isn\u2019t Chinese or, at the very least, doesn\u2019t really resemble Chinese food.

Properties of blue light: Blue light does not penetrate as deeply into tissue as red light. Therefore, if the vessel is sufficiently deep, the re\ufb02ectance in the blue will be affected to a lesser extent.2. Deoxygenated venous blood has a greater absorption coefficient than oxygenated arterial blood in the red spectral region, and this difference of two, rather small, values is ampli\ufb01ed because of the long path length of red light in scattering tissue. As a result, veins are more likely to look blue than arteries at the same diameter and depth.3. Diameter and depth of a blood vessel: Often arteries are not seen at all because they are generally smaller than veins and have thicker vessel walls. It has been shown that a small vessel will look red when close to the surface. However, if a super\ufb01cial vessel is large it can still look bluish, particularly in the case of the vein. On the other hand, if the depth of a vessel is large, even red remitted light will not be in\ufb02uenced by the vessel, and it will not be seen.

I normally demonstrate this fantastic visual transformation of red into blue to my students by means of a dark-red object, two layers of plastic, and a tan-colored surface with a hole in it. Here is why, in the case of veins, we are looking at gray, seeing it as blue, while expecting to see red. \"Red\" is the color we assume we should see. \"Gray\" is the \"true color\" on our retina. \"Blue\" is the optical illusion - our perception of the gray. Here is what happens with the red color of blood, regardless of arterial or venous. Blood in a test-tube appears dark-brown, deep-burgundy, like wine - almost black, not red. Veins are dark-colored tubes visible through the two translucent layers of the skin and the wall of the vein or artery. The deep-burgundy, when looked at through a translucent film, would appear gray (you have to see it to believe it).Don't take my word for it - test it: look at the color of any deep-red object wrapped in a semi-transparent beige plastic bag, and you'll see light-violet or gray. As a result, you\u2019ll be reminded of the fact that color is an optical illusion, more complex and elusive than we like to believe. Now take a brown grocery bag, make a one-inch hole in it, and place that hole over the red object wrapped in plastic. You will see blue! Gray appears blue due to Simultaneous Contrast (see Color Theory): the tan-colored skin has an orangish tint to it (tan is an \"orange family\" color) which makes gray appear bluish. The same optical effect happens when you draw in gray crayon on beige or tan paper: the lines begin to look blue (you must try it to believe it). I know that most people expect a medical-science-based answer, and not related to Color Theory. If you haven't studied color closely, the following is hard to accept. Colors do not exist outside of our perception. Any frequency of wavelength reflected from a surface, that hits our eye is colorless energy, which gets translated by the brain into a specific color perception. There is a widespread misconception that Color Theory is for color-mixing for artists, craftsmen, and designers (even in Wikipedia, Color Theory is limited to that narrow usage). But in reality, Color Theory is a great tool for explaining why we see colors the way we do. Almost any why-question about color requires referencing Color Theory. It overlaps into chemistry, physics, physiology, geography, cosmology, psychology, biology, and other fields of science.",

In significant part, this comes about through a physical phenomenon called Tyndall scattering of light[1]\u2014the same thing that makes the sky or a mountain lake look blue. It\u2019s not because the blood is blue or the veins are blue.Footnotes[1] Tyndall effect - Wikipedia",
            "After your blood is pumped to your lungs by your heart, it's bright red because hemoglobin -- the iron-containing, oxygen-transporting protein in our red blood cells -- binds to the oxygen the blood just picked up. From the lungs, the blood goes back to the heart (this is called pulmonary circulation), which pumps it out to the rest of the body via the arteries and into tiny blood vessels called capillaries, where it gives its oxygen to the body's tissues (systemic circulation). On its return trip to the heart through the veins, the oxygen-depleted blood is dark red or maroon, because the hemoContinue ReadingAfter your blood is pumped to your lungs by your heart, it's bright red because hemoglobin -- the iron-containing, oxygen-transporting protein in our red blood cells -- binds to the oxygen the blood just picked up.

On its return trip to the heart through the veins, the oxygen-depleted blood is dark red or maroon, because the hemoglobin is no longer bound to oxygen. Why So Blue?Now, I'm no surgeon, but real doctors will tell you that when you poke around inside a human being and see a vein or artery in its naked glory, it isn't blue. If blood isn't blue, and veins and arteries aren't actually blue, why do our veins look blue through our skin? When you look down at the veins in your arm, light of different wavelengths is hitting the skin, the veins and the blood. Some of that light is being absorbed, and some is getting scattered and reflected back to your eye. Different wavelengths of light have different properties and abilities. As it turns out, blue light, compared to red light 1) doesn't penetrate the skin as well, 2) is absorbed by the blood more, and 3) is more likely to be scattered and make it back to your eye. So, if a vein is close to the surface of the skin, most of the blue light will be absorbed, and even though red light doesn't reflect as much, the red light:blue light ratio is high enough to make the vein appear red. With deeper veins, the blood doesn't absorb as much blue or red light. But the blue light's inability to penetrate as deeply as red light makes the veins appear blue.",

For example..the skin is opaque but also allows light to pass so somewhat translucent\u2026lets take the colour of skin as pale yellow, the blue veins(blue colour is due to light interaction) will now interact with pale yellow skin and the hue will change to green and you will perceive green veins :-P Hope this is helpful :-)",

The blood appears red because it contains a pigment called hemoglobin which consists of iron and protein. Blood is red, even when it is deoxygenated. But why do veins look blue? Actually they are not blue but what is the reason behind the blue appearance of blood vessels or veins? This is due to optical illusion. Blue light does not penetrate tissue as much as red light. If the blood vessel is deep enough, your eyes appear more blue than the red reflected light due to the partial absorption of red reflected blood. It can also be understood that blue light rays do not penetrate the tissue to such a depth as compared to red color and hence they become more reflective than before. On the other hand, if we talk about the red colored rays, then the red colored rays go to the inside and some part is reflected outside. For this reason, the color of vessels or nerves appears blue.",
            "Because the veins having the blood which is deoxygenated. That causes the hemoglobin to become Carbamino hemoglobin. And its concentration increases in the venous blood imparts the Bluish color and the Carbon dioxide concentration also high In the venous blood. Thank you. Upvote if you got it.",
            "While it is true that blood is always red, when you look at a vein, you are not actually looking at the red blood cells. You are seeing the outside wall of the vein which actually is blue. Veins are not transparent or see-through."

Add to that the double disclaimer from the waitress, and I knew I was in for some real heat. But I didn\u2019t know just how real\u2026 A minute or so later, she delivered Satan\u2019s Hand Roll, and wished me luck. My brother eyes me carefully from across the table as I bit right into it, and took a big mouthful of the unassuming little thing. He watched as I chewed, swallowed, and said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s actually not so bad.\u201d It turns out that the phrase\u2014\u201dIt\u2019s actually not so bad\u201d\u2014seriously angers the spice gods. No sooner had I said it than my mouth and sinuses started to burn so much I thought they might actually be on fire. I could see my brother\u2019s eyes go wide as mine started to water, and I drank everything I could in front of me. The water didn\u2019t seem to do anything, and a sip of beer seemed to boil in my mouth. Weirdest of all, amidst all the burning pain, my vision started to change, and I started to hear a loud noise like a waterfall behind me. I thought Satan\u2019s Hand Roll must have been laced with some sort of psychedelic. (Later I would learn that powerful spice released large amounts of endorphins. I was essentially experiencing a sudden and massive runner\u2019s high.) I got up and stumbled my way to the bathroom, trying to seem casual as I passed by the waitress. But I think my red, teary eyes and hyperventilation must have given away my fragile state. I stood in front of the mirror trying to blow my nose as fast as it was running, and discovered that long inhales and short exhales through the mouth helped\u2026a little, anyway. Eventually I felt okay enough to go back to my seat. The waitress approached, noticing my discombobulation and the half eaten hand roll in front of me. \u201cHow was it?\u201d she asked, trying to be as kind as possible. \u201cIt was, uh\u2026\u201d I struggled to find my words. \u201cTasty,\u201d I muttered, unconvincingly. Not to be totally defeated, I asked for a to-go box, and reluctantly admitted that, at least this time, Satan had defeated me. A couple years later, though, I learned Satan\u2019s secret\u2026That restaurant had closed, and a friend of mine was working at a different sushi place that had opened in town. I mentioned Satan\u2019s Hand Roll to one of the other chefs. Turns out, he had been the chef in the kitchen that day, sending the waitress to give me warnings. \u201cSo, I have to know,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhat was the secret recipe?\u201d \u201cSecret recipe?\u201d he answered, laughing. \u201cNo, that was just a ton of habanero sauce.\u201d So, what did I learn from this experience?When a chef tells you something\u2019s spicy, he may really mean itHabanero peppers can make you hallucinateNo matter how intense and spicy the meal, I can handle it (just maybe not very gracefully\u2026)Later, I even included habanero eating as an exercise in course I teach on mental toughness.

German cuisine became rather bland, partly because hot spices did not grow in Germany but had to be imported, so they were very expensive. However, after WW II, exotic spices became available again and some Germans learned to like spicy food, first from the Balkan, later also from China, Turkey, U.S. or Mexico. After the war, the Currywurst was invented, a bratwurst in a ketchup-like sauce with curry powder. Some like to spice it up, even with pure capsaicin. However, most Germans still have a problem with spicy food. The first chilis (\u201cpeperoni\u201d) were served in Balkan restaurants, but quickly, mild peperoni replaced the hot ones.

While many of those missing are found relatively quickly, thousands disappear, for different reasons, whether by choice or not, for more than a year, becoming, in effect, what investigating agencies often call \u201ccold cases.\" Additionally, it ishttps://www.biometrica.com/is-namus-reporting-required-in-your-state___________________________________________Original Answer I am so glad that you asked this question!!! It frustrates me so much that television and movies perpetuate this false information about having to wait 24 or 48 hours to make a report. It is simply not true, and it deters a lot of people from making such reports in a timely fashion. You do NOT have to wait at all if you feel that someone is missing, and anybody suspecting that a person is missing or kidnapped should report the person as soon as possible. AND you do not have to be in the same city or state as the person who is missing in order to report them missing. Both Federal and State Laws require that law enforcement \u201caccept, without any form of mandatory waiting period, a report of a missing person, and that they \u201cdiligently investigate all reports of missing persons, whether they are adults or juveniles\u2026 and that they not differentiate between \u201crunaways\u201d and missing juveniles for investigative purposes.\u201d I worked as an emergency police dispatcher from 1990 to 2000. The training I received from the DOJ was that departments are legally required to take missing person reports at the time that they are initially reported, and they cannot be advised to wait for any period of time. The law came into being because investigations of homicides uncovered that some of the cases should initially have been investigated as missing persons. Because family and friends believed that they had to wait, or had been discouraged from filing reports, they often did not come back to file a report. In those instances, it is possible that an early investigation might have made a difference in either preventing a crime or catching a perpetrator. Without the missing person report, identifying victims was also hindered. And in the case of missing persons with diminished intellectual capacity, a missing person report can aid in returning those persons home in cases where the victim is unable to tell law enforcement where he or she lives. There is now a national database of missing persons to aid in investigating and hopefully locating individuals that have been reported as missing. In spite of this, there are some officers who will try to get out of taking missing person reports. Especially, if they don\u2019t feel that there is enough information to warrant a missing person report, or if they feel that it is \u201cjust\u201d a runaway in the case of older teens. For a period of time, I had taken a teenage foster child into my home. Children\u2019s services informed us that if the child ran away, we were supposed to report it law enforcement right away and have them take a missing person report. The one time that the teen did run away, I called the local Sheriff to file a report. The officer that came out, tried to discourage me from taking the report. Knowing that, by law, they were required to take a report, I insisted, until the officer reluctantly agreed to take the report. Another stipulation of the statutes requiring law enforcement to take a missing person report is that the reporting person does not have to be, nor reside in the same place as the missing person. For example, if I live in Oregon but I believe that my best friend in New York is missing; then either the law enforcement agency in Portland or in New York is required to take a report. Ideally, the agency of residence will go to the home address of the person for a welfare check, before filing a report. There were times when I was working as a dispatcher when a person would call to report a person missing in an adjacent city. I would transfer the person to the residing agency of the missing person. I would also tell the caller that the agency was required to take a report; and I would tell them to call us back if there were any problems, ensuring them that either our agency or the other agency would take a report. Hope this answers your question!",
            "A common misconception is that a person must be absent for at least 24 hours before being legally classed as missing, but this is rarely the case. Law enforcement agencies often stress that the case should be reported as early as possible\u2026I suggest anything from 24 - 48 hours, if the person is still not found, then you should file a missing person report as soon as possible so the law enforcement agencies can help with further search.",
            "Depends on the age and circumstances. Juveniles and elderly can be reported immediately. If there are any suspicious circumstances, any age person can be reported immediately. If there is nothing suspicious, say a 24 year old doesn't come home after work, no report will usually be generated for 24 hours. A BOLO may be issued with instructions for officers to have the person call home. As always, this answer is for my local jurisdictions in Alabama.",
            "Our rule was that there was no minimum time frame required to file a missing person report.

For children and elderly or disabled people with diminished ability to care for themselves we pretty much always sent a deputy immediately to talk to the caller, then the deputy could start the report and search on scene, especially in the case of really little kids. With regular adults it's a bit more tricky because as an adult you are well within your rights to stop being in contact with everyone you know at any time, and may then appear to be \u201cmissing.\u201d It all came down to asking the caller what exactly has them concerned, specifically getting to the bottom of typical behavior for the missing person. Do they normally stay in touch on a regular basis? If so, how long has it been since anyone has heard from them? Have they been depressed or talked of harming themselves at any time in the past? Do they have drug or alcohol problems? Do they have any domestic violence issues or anything where someone would want to harm them specifically? Where and when were they last known to be? All those sorts of questions. If any of those answers seemed like they could cause us concern then we would take the missing report. With most adults, they're not missing, they are just choosing to be out of touch for whatever reason. I can remember several times where a family member or friend would want to report someone missing and could not really articulate why they were concerned. Occasionally on those we would get a phone number for the \u201cmissing\u201d person and call them. Always an ackward conversation would follow: I'm from the sheriff's office, so and so just called because they are worried about you and wanted to report you missing. Are you Ok? Why yes I am, I just really don't want to talk to that person right now (or ever again). Then the real ackward call back to the person wanting to file the report to tell them that no the person is not missing, they just don't want to talk to you right now. They will call you when they want to chat. We would politely tell the caller to give the person some space, you know: don't call them, they will call you. This was especially hard when it was separated parents calling about their kids that live with the other parent. Sometimes the kid just does not want to talk to mom or dad for a while\u2026 This type of call sometimes led to requests for a welfare check, especially if the kid was living out of state.",

My mama (maternal uncle) was about 8 years old. He was kidnapped from outside the home, while playing with his friends. My nana (maternal grandfather) was already no more. My nani (maternal grandmother) was illiterate and had 3 daughters (including my mother), other than the son who was kidnapped. No male member in the house left after that kidnapping. Now, you can see the plight of the family. They desperately searched for my mama for several years. That was a different age, not the internet age of today. Whenever somebody gave some clue that he saw someone resembling my mama in some remote town, my nani would request some relative to go and search. This continued for several years. Till date, my mama has not been found. Nobody knows why he was kidnapped, whether by those running the beggars-racket or some criminal-racket. If alive, he would be about 68 years old today and nobody would be able to recognize him. Today, my mother is about 80+ years; both her sisters and her mother (my nani) have died. Even, by mistake, if someone mentions about the kidnapping of my mama, tears would start flowing from my mother\u2019s eyes. That incident is etched in her memory. Permanently. She cannot forget it. That\u2019s not all. After I was born, at a very young age, I got to see the worried faces of my mother and nani. So, since very early age, I heard about this incident hundreds of times. And, it perhaps helped me once. When I was about 8 years\u2019 old, I accompanied my father by bus to the district headquarter. He had to handover some important documents at the residence of his boss, and had to immediately return by the last bus. It was already dark. In order to save time for catching the last bus, my father hired a rickshaw, and asked that rickshaw puller to wait outside the house of his boss. He left me too outside the main gate of the house. It was just a 2-3 minute work. Within a minute or two of my father having gone inside the house, the rickshaw puller lifted me and he forcibly started putting me in the rickshaw. The incident of kidnapping of my mama came to my mind at the speed of light. It scared me. I instantly shouted loudly. My father and his boss came out of the house hurriedly and that rickshaw puller ran away throwing me on the ground. I got saved from being kidnapped! I hope you see the context of my narrating these incidents as an answer to this question. Most of mob-lynching incidents in India in last two months have taken place on the rumours of child-lifting gangs.[1] The above two incidents took place decades earlier. However, India has not changed till date. Are you aware that every year about 2 to 3 lakh persons go missing from India? Most of these are kids. In most of these cases, the police would not even register FIRs. In 2012, I had filed a PIL in the Supreme Court in the name of the NGO, Lokniti Foundation, and argued it on various occasions in last 6 years. This PIL was for introducing DNA Profiling for cross-matching missing persons on one hand, and traced persons & unidentified dead bodies (UIDBs) on the other. For 6 years, the Government (and CBI) kept opposing this PIL on one ground or another, even though earlier they were themselves contemplating somewhat similar but had failed to take any action. Finally, on 1st May this year (2018), the Government assured the Supreme Court that it would table a DNA related Act in the monsoon session of Parliament. On the basis of this assurance given by Government, the Supreme Court disposed of my PIL. [Read the order.] A few days back, there was a news report that, finally, the Central Cabinet has approved the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2018.[2] I hope that, as assured, this Bill will be tabled in Parliament in the coming monsoon session and will be passed by Parliament. Of course, there would be the hurdle of the privacy brigade that this Bill has to clear. Why I am writing all this? Well, the fact remains that a large number of children are kidnapped every year from different parts of India. The number is not small, it is expected to be more than 2 lakh children kidnapped every year. Unlike the regular FIRs, there is no proper record with police of these kidnappings. Why? Because, many of such kidnappings are shown by police as \u201cmissing\u201d children, wherein no FIR is needed. Disgusting as it may be, it is a harsh fact. During my tenure as DCP in South Mumbai, I had rescued several girls from prostitution racket. On many occasions, I personally asked some of those girls the names of their parents, their village / city. Most of them did not know. In fact, many of them did not know their own real names. Why? Because they were kidnapped as a child. They had no memory of their early age. So, how DNA Profiling can help? DNA Profile of every individual in the world is unique. Even twins have different DNA Profiles, unless they are identical twins. Further, DNA Profile does not change with age. So, what we wanted in the above PIL was preparation of DNA profile of all missing persons on the one hand; and, DNA profile of all traced / rescued persons and unidentified dead bodies (which are about 40,000 every year) on the other hand. A software can then automatically match them. Using this method, lakhs of rescued / traced persons can be united with their relatives. Tens of thousands of unidentified dead bodies can be identified and investigation conducted to know the reason of their death, which in many cases is murder. Moreover, if a person at least knows that he or she was kidnapped some 20-30 years back but is still in the net of prostitution racket or begging racket, he can give his DNA at the designated centres which can then help him/her getting united with relatives. So, justice can be done in many ways. This whole scheme was only on voluntary basis for those who are willing to give their DNA details. No compulsion. So, no privacy violation. And, this scheme was prepared in consultation with one of the premier scientific lab in the public sector, would have cost some 20-30 crore rupees per year only. For those who are not aware, DNA Profile of a missing person can be found from the clothes, comb, shoes, tooth-brush, etc., used by him/her before being getting kidnapped, etc. Secondly, DNA Profile of such missing persons can also be found from the blood sample of his/her siblings or parents. These are scientifically proven facts. At long last, the Government has agreed to implement the DNA profiling system. Provided the privacy-industry does not create further hurdles. Provided the Parliament passes the law. I have written all this, not by way of digression from directly answering the question, but by way of offering a solution to the mob lynching problem. This may not be a perfect solution, but is a part of the solution. It may not prevent future kidnappings of children, but it may help detect past cases of kidnapping / missing children. And, I can vouch from my police background that detection of an existing case generally helps in prevention of future cases, directly or indirectly. Let me come back to the original question. Most of the mob lynching cases in India, that took place recently, are due to rumours of child-lifting gangs operating in different parts of the country. Some of the rumours may actually be rumours, spread by WhatsApp messages. But, the fact remains that about 2 to 3 lakh children are kidnapped every year in India. Trust me on this \u2013 I have done enough research on this issue. In addition, we are aware that many kids are kidnapped for ransom too. And, I have no hesitation in saying that the police is mostly ineffective in all such cases. So, there is an actual fear in the mind of parents, relatives. Look inside your own heart. As a parent, as a brother / sister, you would not like your ward or sibling being kidnapped by someone. This fear operates in the minds of people in India. This is further compounded due to the fact that people have little faith in the Government and the police authorities. So, the moment there is a suspicion, people act immediately. They would nab the person and start beating him. Beating a person, beyond a limit, leads to death. Mob lynching. Unfortunate, but harsh fact of life. From my experience as a former police officer, I can tell you that even the best of persons can lose temper and start beating the opponent on slightest of provocation. Do you remember Shah Rukh Khan incident in Wankhede Stadium? Look how a superstar behaved?[3] Remember, another superstar, Saif Ali Khan, beating up a foreigner in a five-star hotel in Mumbai?[4] Recall Navjot Singh Sidhu, beating someone in road rage case, and that person died in the incident? Recently, our Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court fined him with a princely sum of \u20b9 1000 (and no imprisonment) for that incident that caused a death!!![5] The point is, even the best of persons can lose their temper when provoked. You can well imagine what would happen when ordinary persons, the common men and women, find that someone is trying to kidnap their child. Usually, it starts with beating the suspect. But, sometimes, it leads to death. As it happened in Navjot Singh Sidhu case too. Let me tell emphatically that I AM NOT SUPPORTING OR JUSTIFYING mob-lynching. I am merely analysing the \u201cWhy\u201d part of your question. Why is there mob lynching in India? By all means, we must punish those responsible for mob-lynching as per the provisions of law, giving them benefit of right of self-defence, wherever (and if) applicable. I know some of you may not be satisfied with my answer. Some of you may be expecting me to utter a few words about \u201ccow-brigade\u201d or the beef-related incidents. Perhaps, that might have been the motive to ask this question. Well, while most of the recent mob-lynching incidents in India relate to fears of child-lifting gangs, I know some incidents have taken place due to suspicion of a person carrying or storing beef or allegedly smuggling cows for the purpose of killing them. If my information is correct, over last 4 years or so, about 10 to 20 such incidents might have taken place in India relating to this issue too. Before I answer that, let me refer to you a news report that I saw last week. Well, the heading of the news was: \u201cGive me atom bomb, I'll wipe out Holland : Pakistan's rising Islamist politician Khadim Hussain Rizvi\u201d.[6] Frankly speaking, after reading the heading, I felt that the newspaper has mistakenly mentioned Holland instead of India. Why would a Pakistani politician think of wiping out Holland? But, when I read the full report, I realised that he was thinking of wiping out Holland, due to some proposed competition of cartoons depicting the Prophet. Using atom bomb to wipe out the whole country because some stupid persons in that country wanted to hold a competition of cartoons? This is not a hollow threat. On 7 January 2015, 12 persons were killed and 11 persons injured in the office of Charlie Hebdo weekly newspaper in France because it had published a cartoon of the Prophet.[7] Do you get the message? This is extent to which people can go if you try to play with their emotions, their faith. In India, there are about 100 crore Hindus. Many of them consider cow as their mother. A few of them can resort to beating up a person carrying beef or smuggling cows with the suspicion of killing those cows. Let me tell it emphatically again that I do not support the mob-lynching for any reason, whatsoever. I believe that let the law take its course. But, what I am trying is to analyse the reasons. In the public transport buses, I have often seen written in Hindi, which translates to: \u201cPassengers are themselves responsible for safety of their belongings\u201d. So, we should try not to do something which can harm us. We should not play with the emotions or the faith of others. Mob lynching is absolutely unlawful. It is a crime. I condemn it whole-heartedly. Persons guilty of mob lynching need to be punished according to law. However, what I have tried to do in my answer is to analyse the reasons for mob lynching, as a student of criminology. Why does it happen? Nobody can understand it better than me who still finds tears in the eyes of his 80+ years old mother, 60 years after her only brother was kidnapped who continues to be untraced till date.Footnotes[1] Centre asks States to check mob lynching fuelled by child-lifting rumours[2] Cabinet clears DNA database on crime[3] Transcript of Shah Rukh Khan's Wankhede fracas - Times of India \u25ba[4] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Saif-Ali-Khan-arrested-for-assaulting-South-African-businessman-released-on-bail/articleshow/11997481.cms[5] Road rage case: Sidhu acquitted of culpable homicide, fined Rs 1,000 for 'causing injury' - Times of India[6] https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/give-me-atom-bomb-ill-wipe-out-holland-pakistans-rising-islamist-politician-khadim-hussain-rizvi/articleshow/64930191.cms[7] Charlie Hebdo shooting - Wikipedia",

I am not denying the fact that government is not responsible for the mob Lynching happening all around India but at the same time what are we doing? We are the one who decides mob lynching and it is in our hand to stop this. It is now a question on sensibility of humans towards other human. Another important reason is that the state of police and the judiciary have weaken the people faith in the system and they now believe that there is a high chance of culprit go unpunished. It has become a national phenomenon now. In july 2018 SC passed directives urging the parliament to enact a law to deal with the crime \u2018\u2019that threatens rule of law and the country social fabric. It also came up with 11 point prescription which included state govt designating a nodal officer for taking measures to prevent incidents of mob lynching and violence. According to some reports of a delhi based NGO, 35% of police personnel interviewed for the survey think it is natural for the mob to punish the culprit in the case of cow slaughter and 43%think it is natural for the mob to punish the culprit in the case of rape. From the reports it is obviously concluded why the police personnel not try to prevent it or act against it. Also, most of the cases of mob lynching is related to child traffickers. One of the reason behind the aggression among people is more than 2 lakh children are kidnapped every year in india and unlike the regular FIRs , there is no proper record with police of these kidnappings because many of such kidnappings are shown by police as missing children, wherein no FIR is needed. Its high time to take strict actions against the people involved in mob lynching. No one deserve to be unheard.",

It actually disturbs me thinking as to what is the reason behind such eruption of emotions in a human being where he places religion before humanity and absolutely ignores the value of human life over issues, if not very small are definitely not beyond somebody\u2019s life. This feeling of anguish that thrives in one human against another, if i try to understand according to my perspective is a result of bursting of this bubble of hatred, anger, vengeance against a fellow human or a particular group which he is carrying deep in his heart. This feeling is looking for one opportunity or one particular incident or that slightest provocation that could burst this bubble and release his anguish. While i discuss this anguish, i do not limit it to mere cow slaughter ( with a communal color), but i also refer here to killing of the lower caste female allegedly accused of braid cutting (casteist color) and in no time it can take form of a classist intolerance. As to the cause of such incidents it definitely is not a short term phenomenon. It has grown through years, through experiences and interactions which to my understanding is primarily rooted in the inequality in the society. This inequality could be a result of economic disparity, social discrimination, favouritism, corruption and most evidently the communal outburst in a globally acclaimed secular nation with not so secular people. I\u2019m no political scientist but the situation prevalent in our country forces me to question, if we are going the right way with the positive form of secularism that as Indians we proudly boast of."

And if you were to do so, it would be a disaster. You\u2019d be leaning on the horn, trying to turn left and right at the same time, using all the gears from reverse to overdrive simultaneously, stepping on the brake and accelerator (while also turning on the parking brake), flashing the headlights, opening and closing all the doors while trying to sit in all the seats, and so on.

Larger animals have more sensory inputs and more motor outputs, which require more intermediate neurons to deal with. In addition, because the animal's body is larger, the \"cost\" of a larger brain is relatively less. In humans, the brain is 2% of the total body weight and uses a giant 20% of the body's total energy. An elephant brain is 4x larger than human by weight, but an elephant's body is up to 80x larger by weight. As a percentage, an elephant's brain is less than 0.1% of its total body weight, so relative to a human brain at 2%, an elephant's brain is 20x smaller. Note also that while elephants have 6x more neurons than humans in their cerebellum, which handles motor coordination, they have 5x fewer neurons in their cerebral cortex, which is the part specialized for cognition in humans. In elephants, 97% of the brain's neurons are estimated to be in the cerebellum, whereas in humans it is 50%, with 25% being in the cerebral cortex. [1][1] Herculano-Houzel S et al, 2014.

Unlike other animals most primates have forward facing eyes.[1] They probably evolved those eyes to help then find fruits, something that most primates like to eat. Forward facing eyes help primates focus on objects.If that seems unremarkable to you, try to think of other animals with forward facing eyes. Most have eyes on the sides of their heads. This collection of North American animals includes just a couple of species with forward facing eyes (bobcat, lion, and weasel).[2]Hands with opposable thumbs are common in primates but rare in other animals. This picture shows hands from various primates.[3] Hands with thumbs are very helpful for handling fruit.Compare those to the hands of a squirrel which doesn\u2019t have thumbs at all.[4]A few primate species discovered that thumbs help one hold tools, as this bearded capuchin monkey of Brazil is doing.[5]Primates tend to be social, often living in groups. Group living encourages intelligence because each individual has to figure out how deal with everyone else. Dealing with social hierarchies and competing for mates requires intelligence.That isn\u2019t the whole story. I describe other aspects of primates that led them to be intelligent here:Israel Ramirez \u00b7 1yWhy are large brains a common characteristic of primates?It\u2019s really humbling to realize that many interesting questions like this don\u2019t have a definite answer. Here\u2019s what we know. Primates are special. They differ from other animals with regard to brains, fertility, and lifespan. Primate brains are bigger, on average, than those of other animals. This chart shows brain size relative to body weight. Primates are shown as gray squares. The set of four gray squares bound in a box is humans. You should be able to see that these values are generally higher than the black circles representing other mammals and grey triangles representing birds. The other markers represent cold blooded animals (light grey circles: bony fishes; light grey triangles: reptiles. Taken from (Neuronal factors determining high intelligence).  But that graph doesn\u2019t do justice to the matter. Not only do primates have bigger brains but, for a given size, primate brains have more neurons. This chart shows the number of neurons for a given weight of cerebral cortex (How Humans Evolved Supersize Brains | Quanta Magazine).  Primates are unusual in other ways. They have a lower fertility than other mammals; fewer children than other mammals. That\u2019s doubly true for apes, as this chart shows (The trade-off between number and size of offspring in humans and other primates).  Primates also live longer than most mammals. This chart shows longevity versus body weight. The solid line shows the average for mammals. The black circles show primates. It turns out that bats and birds also live longer than most mammals. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2288695/).  Why? Social organization hypothesis The most popular theory is that social interactions encourage large brains. Big brains are definitely an advantage if you are a male competing with other males. Being smarter than others should allow a male to get access to both food and females. Smart primates do have complex societies and chimpanzee society, at least, does challenge the mental abilities of males. The problem with that idea is that there is no consistent relationship between type of animal society and brain size. Each ape species has it\u2019s own type of society, yet all are smart. Chimpanzees and bonobos have entirely different social organizations but their brain sizes are similar. Gorilla societies have a single dominant male and several females plus immature males. Orangutans are mostly solitary. Gibbons are monogamous. It\u2019s hard to claim that social interactions cause big brains when there is no consistent relationship between the two. Diet and lifestyle hypothesis Another possibility focuses on the fact that brains are costly to maintain. If you have a big brain, you need to eat extra food to maintain it. Sometimes that\u2019s worth the effort and sometimes it isn\u2019t. Maybe primates evolved to take advantage of their costly brains to find high-energy foods. There\u2019s some evidence for that. Primates that eat high energy foods, like fruit, tend to have larger brains, on average, than those which eat low energy foods like leaves (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0112, Is fruit eating responsible for big brains?). You need to be smart to find high-energy foods. People took this strategy one step further by using fire to make foods easier to digest (Israel Ramirez's answer to What changed in the early man\u2019s mind that led to harnessing fire?). This concept explains low fertility in primates because the cost of maintaining a large brain reduces the energy available for producing young. This concept also explains primates having long lifespans. You get the most benefit from having a big brain if you take the time to learn how to use it. You need to live a long time to get the full benefit of being smart. Maybe both social organization and diet were involved. This chart summarizes how that might work (Why are there so many explanations for primate brain evolution?).  To read more: Why are there so many explanations for primate brain evolution? Primate brain size is predicted by diet but not sociality Metabolic constraint imposes tradeoff between body size and number of brain neurons in human evolutionI describe the forces that encouraged the evolution of primates here:Israel Ramirez \u00b7 3yWhat are environmental factors that may have led to the emergence of primates?The rise of fruit-bearing trees in the tropical Cretaceous era might have been crucial for the origin of primates. Primates, like us, are unusual. We tend to have large brains and the neurons (brain cells) in our brains are packed tighter together.  That arrangement made it possible for the most intelligent of all, humans, to come about. Here\u2019s our family tree.  What sets primates apart? Many primates are agile and acrobatic tree climbers, maybe better than any other group of animals. That ability comes from having grasping hands and feet, fingernails instead of claws, long tails, and forward-facing eyes that give primates keen stereoscopic vision. Most ground-dwelling primates, except humans, have many of the distinctive features of tree-dwellers including grasping feet. This chart gives you a sense of the commonalities in primate hands (upper part) and feet (lower part).  Most primates, especially humans, are social animals, living in groups and tend to communicate, at least partly, through sounds.  Primates also live longer than most other mammals of the same size. What conditions led to the origin of primates? There aren\u2019t many early primate fossils. Here\u2019s a reconstruction of one, Archicebus achilles, that lived roughly 55 million years ago.  Here\u2019s a reconstruction of another one, Carpolestes simpsoni. It lived roughly 65\u201355 million years ago.  But molecular genetic analyses suggest that the first primates lived much farther back in time, probably 68\u201382 million years ago, before the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs.  So, we have to rely on indirect evidence.  Most primates are tropical, though there are some exceptions. Fruits are an important part of the diet for most primates. Very likely, that was true of the earliest primates as well. It happens that true fruit was coming into being at around this time. Fruit-eating helps explain why most primates live in trees. Fruit-eating also helps explain why primates are the only order with true trichromatic color vision, though a few species have lost this ability. The very first primates probably distinguished two colors instead of three. The three major primate groups, prosimians, New World primates, and Old World primates evolved the ability to detect three colors after they separated, probably during the Middle Cretaceous around 65 million years ago. Other aspects of the primate visual system support this concept. Primate eyes work best in the daytime so the earliest primates might not have been nocturnal. Many primate eyes have a fovea, a region with very good detail vision. Some scientists think that the very first primate eyes had a fovea. That would have helped them pick out fruit in a jungle canopy from a distance.  If primates came about as early as scientists suspect, they may even have helped fruit to evolve by dispersing the seeds in the fruit. Visual predation theory Another possibility is that the first primates were visually oriented predators that ate insects and small animals that lived in trees. This idea helps explain why primates have forward-facing eyes, a feature that is common in carnivorous mammals. Insects provide more protein than fruit. For this reason, many modern primates supplement their diet with them.  Very likely early primates would have eaten them and maybe meat and eggs. This concept used to be popular among scientists but isn\u2019t as popular anymore because primate vision seems to be better tuned to find fruit than insects. But the earliest primates probably did supplement their diet with some meat and insects. Conclusion We don\u2019t know for sure what environmental conditions led to the evolution of primates. There aren\u2019t many fossils and what we have probably aren\u2019t the earliest ones. Indirect evidence suggests that fruit-bearing trees and primates co-evolved, each benefiting the other. Right now many primates are endangered. One day, these remarkable animals, our next of kin, might be gone.

You can rest easy \u2014 on that score, at least. In fact, it's extremely difficult to turn a penny into a lethal weapon, and hurling it over the barricades at the top of the Empire State Building won't get the job done. Even from that height, a penny is too small and flat, and cushioned by too much air, to become a torpedo. Instead, it would flutter to the ground, like a leaf. If it did strike you, it would feel like being flicked in the forehead \u2014 \"but not even very hard,\" said Louis Bloomfield, a physicist at the University of Virginia. And he should know. He recently used wind tunnels and helium balloons to replicate the fall of pennies from skyscrapers. When experimental pennies struck him, it didn't hurt. \"I think one bounced off my face once,\" People mistakenly assume that a falling penny, subject to the force of gravity, will accelerate for the entirety of its fall, achieving breakneck speeds by the time it reaches the ground. This would indeed happen if New York City was evacuated \u2014 that is, if all the air were removed and the penny was tossed off the place into a vacuum \u2014 but as things are, collisions with air molecules slow falling pennies down. Called a \"drag force,\" air resistance opposes the penny's downward motion, counteracting the force of gravity. The faster the penny falls, the greater the air resistance it experiences, and so at a certain maximum velocity of the penny, the drag force becomes equal and opposite to the downward gravitational force. With the two forces balanced, the penny no longer accelerates. Instead it falls at a constant speed, called the terminal velocity, all the way to the ground. Pennies are flat, so they experience a lot of air resistance, and they are light, so it doesn't take much drag to counteract their weight. Thus, if hurled off a skyscraper, pennies achieve their terminal velocity after only about 50 feet (15 meters) of descent. After that point, they flutter to the ground at a measly 25 mph (40 kph), Blo...",

Entire cities had been razed to the ground during the six years between 1939\u20131945; cities which were located in countries which had been widely regarded as some of the biggest economic competitors of the international market at the time: France, Germany, United Kingdom etc.. Out of all the major powers to fight in the war, only one of them economically benefited from its outcome: The United States. To make matters worse, mainland Europe had only started recovering from the calamity of the First World War a generation earlier, which only served to make the Great Depression worse in countries who were directly impacted by the First World War (nearly all of Europe, plus some other countries scattered throughout the world\u2019s continents). Contrary to popular belief, while it is true that the USA gave away a lot of supplies to its wartime allies, including the Soviet Union, it is NOT true that such loans were given out of goodwill.Above: Soviet Troops Resting In Front Of An American-Made Sherman Tank Lend-Lease: How American supplies aided the USSR in its darkest hour The hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans were repaid in interest over a period of multiple generations. For instance, it was not until December 2006 that the United Kingdom had paid back its last wartime debt to the United States; by which time, they had undoubtedly paid far more in interest alone than what had been provided for them during the war years. (Until the 1970s, the United Kingdom was also paying the United States debt for loans dating back to the First World War!)Above: Firemen Putting Out A Fire During The London Blitz Of 1940 UK settles WWII debts to allies Between 1945\u20131970, there was very little economic competition coming from countries outside the United States. The result, was that the United States was able to monopolise the world market to its own advantage, while having to give comparatively little back in return (rampant inflation in countries devastated by the two world wars being another major factor during this time period).Above: Men Lining Up At A Soup Kitchen During The Great Depression Top 5 Causes of the Great Depression \u2013 Economic Domino Effect Unlike the majority of mainland Europe and East Asia, the United States was never directly attacked (air raids on Pearl Harbor and a few island battles on Wake Island and Midway not counting) so its infrastructure was never destroyed. Imagine what the United States would have been like had the war boiled over onto the North American side of the Atlantic (or Pacific) Ocean, and cities such as Manhattan, Washington D.C., Los Angeles and Boston etc. were all reduced into destructive fighting conditions comparable to Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, or even Germany\u2019s Capital, Berlin. Detroit is often regarded as the city that \u201cwon the war\u201d as its population (which was roughly three times the size it currently is) had a large quantity of manufacturing products, notably those owned by Henry Ford and William Knudsen, which mass-produced military vehicles for both the American military, as well as its allies (with loan interest at hand).Above: Franklin Roosevelt And William Knudsen Discussing Manufacturing During The War Years How Detroit Factories Retooled During WWII to Defeat Hitler In earlier periods in history, other countries had also become superpowers by largely profiting off the destruction of their neighbouring countries. For instance, the British became the undisputed power outside of mainland Europe as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the British being able to trade (and annex) foreign countries without much resistance (there is even some speculation that India was only captured so easily by the British because India had been recovering from a similar type of war waged by the Persian military commander, Nader Shah!). Nader Shah's invasion of India - Wikipedia Likewise, the Germans expanded their sphere of influence within Central Europe, as well as parts of Africa. The Russians, on the other hand, focused on the annexation of Eastern Europe and the Crimea Regions \u2014 regions which had been completely devastated during the Napoleonic era \u2014 while also placing some of their political interests in Asia.Above: Napoleon Winning Over His Troops After His Exile From Elba Just like what happened a few decades ago, these countries began seeing their undisputed influence collapsing within a couple of decades, once the countries which had seen their homes completely demolished, were able to return back to normal and become competitors on the market. When a country is in complete ruins, the country that is still in a healthy position can easily buy off their natural resources for what would be seen as pennies by the standard of those living in the healthier countries. This was seen in Africa and East Asia, where American companies shipped off their jobs overseas, because at the time, those countries were so far behind the rest of the industrial world on economic terms, that producing decent quality resources to be shipped back to the west cost virtually nothing.Above: African Child Performing Labour For A Foreign Company Why Nestle is one of the most hated companies in the world What is the situation today? China itself took a blow when many of those same companies began pulling out some of those jobs, as China\u2019s economy is not as far behind as it was only a few years ago, which means that workers are going to expect more pay in order to have a living wage. The United States can try and delay the inevitable by shipping their jobs to Vietnam or Cambodia \u2014 countries which are still recovering from the Cold War era \u2014 though it is probably only a matter of time before those countries recover enough from the past that they also get their inflation under control and begin demanding higher paying wages. Many Americans have this myth in their head that the Reagan era, or even a more recent event, such as the Stock Market Crash of 2008, were the cause of American decline on the international scale. The reality, of course, is that by around 1970, the first noticeable signs that the USA\u2019s supreme control over the world market was coming to an end were already palpable, as it was at around this time that the USA started having some of its first major financial crises since at least the World War Two-era.Above: American Troops In Vietnam While the spending in Vietnam and elsewhere probably did not help with its economic situation, the more likely reason for why the USA started receiving more recession periods during the 1970s is for the reason mentioned above, as well as what I will say below in a clear and direct way: The rest of the world was recovering! There was an oil crisis going on during this time as well, as OPEC had boycotted the United States, though that would hardly have mattered only a few years earlier, as the USA would have been able to buy their oil from some other cheap country and possibly even invade them if they refused, in much the same way the Americans (with the help of the British) orchestrated the overthrow of the Iranian Government in 1953 for this very reason.Above: Former Prime Minister Of Iran Mohammad Mosaddegh Being Arrested By Coup Supporters 1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat - Wikipedia So, the 1970s saw American economic setbacks when other countries were able to get a bigger slice of the international pie, which then forced the Americans to be more competitive in their pricing than previously. What did future decades bring about? Quite interestingly, it seems that the USA was probably making a lot of money out of loan payment interests from countries recuperating from the First and Second World Wars. By the 1970s, nearly all loan payments from the First World War had been repaid from every country which had borrowed from the United States between 1914\u20131918, which then coincided with the time period when countries were beginning to leave the shadow of the succeeding world war.Above: German Citizens Using Baskets Of Paper Money To Buy Some Bread Crumbs When cash was worthless in Germany after the First World War Remember those stories about how Germans after the First World War were so economically broke that they had to bring wheelbarrows full of money to the nearest bakery in order to buy a slice of bread (during some periods, a piece of bread in Germany cost a whopping 460 BILLION marks)? Now, imagine a world where nearly every country \u2014 except the United States \u2014 is either in that state of being, or is at least worse off than they had previously been, and this situation were to last for the better part of a generation. This is the global impact that the two world wars had on the international market.Above: Americans Celebrating The End Of The Second World War In 1945 If the First and Second World Wars had never taken place, it is very unlikely that the United States\u2019s sphere of influence would have ever become anywhere near as recognisable as it currently is. Sure, the United States may have been regarded as a fairly strong country, capable of waging a potentially successful war against even the strongest countries if need be: The United States would most certainly NOT, however, have become so economically durable as to have half the world\u2019s GDP when accounted for inflation, as was the case during the immediate decades after the Second World War. In 2008, the housing crisis struck the United States especially hard, and it was not so much because the United States was collapsing as a country, as much as it was yet another sign that the United States as a world power was over.Above: Lehman Brothers Sign Being Taken Down After The Company\u2019s Bankruptcy In 2008 A few decades earlier, the United States would have been able to get away with the types of policies seen during the late 2000s regarding their heavy debt to GDP ratio, as well as their policies regarding the cheap interest rate of houses. Immediately after the Second World War, tens of millions of Americans were practically given a house for free (this was especially true for returning veterans) and many of them received college scholarships or business loans as a way to bolster the American economy\u2019s standard of living in the post-war years. If this was repeated today, the USA would completely collapse into a black hole and never see the light again.Above: Woodstock Hippies In 1969 Of course, the world was different in 1945 when the United States was standing alone as the only major country to not have been directly impacted from the war. Even in terms of manpower, the United States invested only a small number of its citizens into the military (its neighbouring country Canada, for instance, had three times as many citizens in its military per capita during both wars). When you have trillions of dollars of surplus money coming from countries completely shattered by the war, mixed with trillions of dollars of interests which were expected to accumulate over a period of several decades, giving millions of Americans a \u201cfree\u201d house was not that far-fetched. In other words: the United States, quite ironically, had become a socialist state \u2014 to some extent \u2014 though unlike other socialist states, the United States was able to afford this mentality during the immediate years after the Second World War.Above: This Picture In Chicago Shows Just Some Of The Millions Of Buildings And Homes Built As A Result Of Truman\u2019s \u201cFair Deal\u201d Policy Housing Act of 1949 - Wikipedia Unfortunately, this eventually backfired when later generations also demanded the same types of economic and employment opportunities that previous generations were practically given over on a silver platter. How do you say no without losing face, even while the economic benefits which made the post-war boom a possibility no longer existed? Policymakers continued to give the Boomer Generation benefits very comparable to what the \u201cGreatest Generation\u201d received during the post-war years. By the time Generation X came along, some of the more extreme disillusions, such as making housing a fundamental right, had been largely shattered, as the war generations were now ageing and were wanting their own retirement benefits, while simultaneously, the American economy was continuing to find itself fighting more and more against national competitors.Above: Ronald Reagan Being Questioned By News Reporters In The Wake Of The 1987 Crash Reagan's Leadership, Too, Was Questioned After 1987 Market Drop The Crash of 1987 largely ended the era when people could expect to get a working-class job just by verbally asking for one, and expecting to be employed for the rest of their working lifetime. No longer did high school (or lower) guarantee a \u201crespectable\u201d working career. All of a sudden, Americans found their living standards somewhat lowered in the form of having to spend additional years paying for university (many states had free universities until as recently as the 1970s, though this was ended for obvious reasons).Above: University Students During The 1950s Here\u2019s how much more expensive it is for you to go to college than it was for your parents As the international market went back to a somewhat more moderate level, university costs also did not keep up with the salaries of the average working citizen, which made even the cost of attaining a university degree out of reach for a growing chunk of the population, who were now being left out of jobs that their parents and grandparents may have been able to get without even graduating from high school.

How the Federal Government Built White SuburbiaAbove: One Of Many Homes In Detroit Left To Decay After The Economic Crisis Struck The USA Detroit: From Motor City to Housing Incubator Decline of Detroit - Wikipedia Many people before 2009 could have bought a house on a hundred year term while getting paid below minimum-wage, as it was cheaper to live in a house with a stretched loan period which they had no intention of outliving, than it was to buy an apartment. Of course, not everyone who applied were able to get such generous mortgage terms, as comparatively fewer people in the United States were getting homes by the 1990s, while more and more were living in apartments: something which earlier generations, as well as the citizens of most other countries were living in. Since 2009, housing regulations have gotten much stricter.Above: A Simplified Statistic Of The Immediate Effects Of The 2008 Crisis (In The USA) What Caused the 2008 Financial Crisis and Could It Happen Again? Why it's suddenly more difficult to get a mortgage The only examples of people whom I can think of who are still paying on such lengthy mortgage terms are those who bought their homes before the housing crisis forced a change in policy for future \u201chome buyers\u201d. I myself live in Canada, and while our housing policies were never as extreme as had been the case in the United States, policies revolving around mortgage payments are far stricter than they had been. For example, I personally know of people who had mortgage terms of 40\u201350 years when all they had was a 5% down payment (there was a time when even a down payment was not a requirement!).Above: Toronto Suburbs In 1961 This is what the suburbs used to look like around Toronto Since the housing crisis, the Canadian Government now mandates that all house purchasers have a 10\u201320% down payment, and the maximum mortgage period has since bee lowered to 25 years, with talks that it might even be reduced yet again to 20 years in the near future. The age of \u201creckless\u201d spending is over. Ultimately, what happens to the United States in regards to its role in the world stage will be largely dependent on the foreign and domestic policies it chooses to endorse.Above: Donald Trump Speaking About The Coronavirus \u2014 Another Likely Trigger In America\u2019s \u201cDecline\u201d As A Superpower Nation",

If I don't bother to look at it, I will come to the conclusion that I personally feel that the United States has not declined but is still widening the gap with other countries. If you read this answer carefully, you may take a breath of cool air. However, before answering the question, it needs to be explained that the widening gap in the United States mainly erodes the advantages that developed countries such as Britain, France, Germany and Japan once contended with, even monopoly industries, and also relies on the collapse of the Soviet Union. For the time being, there is no contradiction between the development of the United States and that of China. Here I would like to summarize my own thoughts in advance. I have always thought about why the United States is strong: I once thought that the strength of the United States was based on its financial/dollar hegemony, also thought that the strength of the United States was based on its military hegemony, and also thought that the strength of the United States was based on its military hegemony. Based on his superior geographical position and the view of fire across the shore of World War II, but after thinking about it, I found that the United States had become the world's first industrial country around 1900. Without the large-scale construction of higher education talents, the United States would not be able to absorb and transform the achievements of the European Industrial Revolution. In other words, my core argument is that the logical order of thinking between higher education and talent, combined with my previous thinking, has accumulated the following: Does the United States have financial hegemony - > is it that the United States has a large number of talents in finance, economics, international trade and other fields? The United States has military hegemony to escort financial hegemony - > Is it the United States with military strategy, military command, military equipment manufacturing and other fields of talent? Is the US military equipment leading the escort for US military hegemony - > an enterprise with a large number of military science and technology industries? The United States has a large number of military science and technology industry enterprises escorting military equipment - > Is it the United States military industry enterprises to provide a large number of IC, communications, radio frequency, digital images, materials, physics, chemistry, automation, machinery and other fields of advanced education personnel? American military enterprises provide a large number of higher education talents to escort military equipment R&amp;D - > Whether need to meet two points at the same time: sub-node 1: Is the United States adequate financial allocation in the field of defense? Sub-node 2: Are there enough technological enterprises in the United States to accumulate technology in light and heavy industries? Extension of Sub-Node 1: The U.S. defense sector has adequate financial allocation to escort U.S. military enterprises - > There are enough excellent enterprises in the U.S. to provide huge tax revenue for the U.S. government? Extension of sub-node 1: There are enough excellent enterprises in the United States to provide huge tax revenue for the U.S. government to escort the U.S. financial allocation - > Is it that the United States has Pfizer, Intel, AMD, GE, Disney, Google, Microsoft and other top enterprises to achieve huge revenue in the world market? Extension of sub-node 1: There are enough top-level enterprises in the United States with huge revenue to escort U.S. tax revenue - > Is it possible for top-level enterprises in the United States to recruit top-level higher education talents in pharmacy, chemistry, IC semiconductor, materials, stereo imaging, 3D design, system research and development, drive design and other fields? Extension of sub-node 2: Are there enough technological enterprises in the United States to accumulate technology in light, medium and heavy industries - > Are they top enterprises in the United States able to recruit top-level higher education talents in pharmacy, chemistry, IC semiconductor, materials, stereo imaging, 3D design, system research and development, drive design and other fields? At this point, sub-node 1 and sub-node 2 complete the convergence. Let's continue. The United States has many fields of higher education talent for the United States top enterprises to recruit talent Escort - > Is it to meet the following two points at the same time: Branch 1: the United States has a better educational strength and system? Branch 2: The majority of all higher education graduates in the United States, including local graduates, are willing to stay in the United States for development? Branch 1: The United States has a better educational strength and system to escort higher education talents with many fields in the United States - > Is it the United States has higher education (education ontology research) talents with a sound educational system? Branch 2: Most of the graduates of higher education in the United States, including native ones, are willing to stay in the United States and develop into the escort of higher education talents with many fields in the United States - > Is it the social system in which the United States has higher education talents in social sciences, humanities, law and other fields, including equality between the United States and foreign countries, social welfare and racial differences? If the field of vision can not be perfected absolutely, how can we narrow the gap between foreign students and their home countries as far as possible? Sub-node 1 and sub-node 2 completed a convergence at this time, and I will not continue to enumerate later, starting my arguments and arguments. 1. The strength of the United States is fundamental. As one of the most important educational talents in the world, the United States may not have one. It has been building higher education crazily since its founding members. Before the founding of the United States of America, there were only nine institutions of higher learning in the United States. On the 100th National Day, the total number of institutions of higher learning in the United States reached more than 700 (an average of 7 in a year). When the 200th anniversary of the founding of the United States was celebrated, the total number of institutions of higher learning exceeded 2800. Today, there are more than 4810 institutions of higher learning in the United States. In 1862, the United States Federal Government passed the Morrill Land Grant Act, which pushed American higher education into a new dimension of educational support. Soon, the United States absorbed, transformed and re-innovated science and technology from Europe by virtue of the talents of higher education, and rapidly developed to the top. It is these higher education talents who have laid the cornerstone of many American enterprises, such as machinery, electricity, medicine, aviation, aerospace, military industry, automobile, medical equipment, integrated circuits and chips. On the macro level, the economic talents of the United States have established the Bretton Woods monetary system, and the military talents of the United States have established a rapid response. Pan-layout of the global military strategic base and so on. At the end of the last century, Harvard, Yale, Stanford in the United States, Dongda in Japan, Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom, Moscow in the Soviet Union, Paris in France, Munich in Germany, Zurich University in Switzerland, etc. were among the top universities in the world. But now? The United States is almost monopolistic in higher education. Take the ranking of higher education scientific research output that does not include other indicators such as international students as an example:The most frightening is also the extremely high retention rate of talents, that is, a large number of talents who go to the United States for higher education remain in the development of American technology enterprises. In 2015, the United States awarded 55,000 doctorates, 75% in science and engineering, of which 14,000 were foreign nationals, and half were Chinese, Indian and Korean nationals. Statistics on the Intention of Foreign Doctors to Stay in the United States - The number of people who want to stay in the United States is more than three times that of people who want to leave the United States. In 2015, the overall proportion of foreign Doctors in the United States exceeded 70%. The proportion of students who continue to study or work in the United States after graduation is as follows:On the other hand, a data is provided. The source of Undergraduates in seven top science and engineering universities in China (Qingbei + East China Five) is also the reference for the selection of the best group of students in China's higher education. Tsinghua University\uff1aPeking University:Zhejiang university: A total of 1 416 undergraduate graduates in 2016 went abroad to study, accounting for 25.21% of the total number of graduates.Shanghai Jiaotong University:Nanjing University :I won't list the remaining two schools. It's a bit painful to translate pictures into words.Reading the first point above,Many of China's top talents have been attracted. What about your country?, you may already have a preliminary understanding of talent cultivation and attraction in the United States. The following is part of the acceleration of industry in the United States due to better higher education talent. 2. Pharmaceutical, Medical and Medical Industries First of all, the top-notch pharmaceutical industry. Among the 24 top pharmaceutical companies in the world, the United States is far ahead with 12. There are 16 top 50 pharmaceutical companies selected by the United States, which can be said to be basically at the top. American pharmaceutical companies are well-known for their high investment in R&amp;D, with an average R&amp;D/income of about 15-25%, compared with Chinese pharmaceutical companies, which generally do not exceed 3% and modern pharmaceuticals do not exceed 10%. In the last century, the Anglo-French Druid Troika could compete with the United States in medicine, especially GlaxoSmithKline, which was once the world's strongest pharmaceutical company. But now:Then the medical equipment industry, the United States in the world's top 10 manufacturers of medical equipment, 7, GE, Medtronic, Johnson &amp; Johnson and other enterprises are very strong, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson disposable ultrasound knife in many developing countries hospitals will be used 5-10 times.Medical industry, needless to say, almost all of the top students in the United States have chosen to study medicine, ranking the world's top medical institutions.At the same time, the United States, with the FDA as its core, has achieved both large-scale double-blind clinical testing and some speed-up for high-quality and cutting-edge drugs. The global proportion of innovative drugs on the market is as follows, which is only 35% in the last century in the United States, of course, the first one at that time. The fundamental reason for this change is that the speed and ability of R&amp;D of U.S. drug companies have widened the gap with other countries. Some people in the industry once joked that the next generation of targeted drugs in the United States has not yet been resistant to drugs. Come out. Here's the world share of innovative drugs in the United StatesOnly six years after the advent of the first generation of ALK drugs, Pfizer has successfully developed the third generation of ALK.By the way, I won't mention the latter. Many countries in Europe, Japan and other countries have realized that the gap between their talents and the United States is widening. Because Europe, Japan and the United States are still in the same camp for the time being, they are also desperately trying to enjoy the dividend of the elite talents in the United States. There are too many reasons. There is a region in the United States called Cambridge, not the British one. The United States has the richest medical resources, because there are Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there are Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical College under the three general hospitals and other top hospitals. In other words, there are the top medical talents here, especially the newly graduated students who have the lowest cost to recruit. As a result, Switzerland's Roche Heavy Gold ($46.8 billion) acquisition of the former American cancer giant Genentech Company, with its cancer research, has tasted tremendous sweetness. It rushed to Top3, the world pharmaceutical company, and continued to set up a pharmaceutical R&amp;D center in Marlborough, Boston, to recruit students. Novartis Switzerland, GSK UK and other companies have also established R&amp;D centers in Waltham, Boston. Safino, France, succeeded in becoming the top 10 in the world by acquiring the former American medical giant Jianzan, and continues to expand its R&amp;D centers here just like Roche. Japan's second tier pharmaceutical companies, such as Takeda, have also taken root here to ensure that they can use American talent to keep up with the first tier of the United States. 3. Semiconductor Industry The United States has six top 10 companies in the world. In 2017, American semiconductor companies accounted for 46% of global sales. In 2018, U.S. wafer-free chip companies accounted for 68% of the global market share.Without comparison, there is no conclusion about the trend. Here are the changes of semiconductor enterprises in recent decades.4. IT Industry Operating system aspect Desktop PC Operating System: The only competitor of WIN7 (65%) is WIN10 (17%), the rest are WINXP (12%) and MAC (6%). All of the above are products of American companies. Mobile Operating System: Android and iOS accounted for 98.2%, Windows Phone was the third most expensive but only 0.73%. All of the above are products of American companies. Software servicesA lot of people may not contact, feel that the software does not matter ah, not the system and APP, China also has IQY APP and Fighting Fish ah. How to say, this software is not the other software. A large number of software are used in computing, modeling, industrial design, signal processing, etc. It plays an extremely important role in scientific research and engineering. Take engineering design as an example, everyone knows what civil engineering is, but design can not be separated from ANSYS (USA, FEA) software, ABAQUS (USA, non-linear finite element analysis software), which are the most famous industrial design software. ANSYS software pays attention to the expansion of application fields, covering fluid and electromagnetic fields. There are a wide range of research fields such as multi-physical field coupling. ABAQUS focuses on structural mechanics and related fields. In addition to the non-linear solution software, there are Marc (USA, MSC) and so on.In addition to the above, you may have heard of CAD, MATLAB, Photoshop, PR and other software, all of which are products of American companies. China's chip design includes several large chip factories, which are inseparable from American Cadence and Synopsys. These two relationships are somewhat similar to Intel and AMD. Domestic chip companies buy Cadence and Synopsys. Usage rights are purchased for the longest period of time, that is, fear of being sanctioned by the United States or how.Now you probably understand that software refers to those critical software services that are used in a lot of scientific research and engineering, without which a lot of work can not be carried out. 5. Aerospace Industry Aerospace has always been the integration of a country's most sophisticated technology, many years ago, American space is not lonely, Maozi and ESA play with the United States. Now the United States is so bored that it can only play with itself. NASA is undoubtedly the strongest Space Research Institute in the United States. What about engineering? ULA, a joint venture company of Boeing, USA, mainly produces Delta IV rocket, Delta IV heavy rocket and Cosmos 5 rocket. ULA has the strongest hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine RS series (invisible afterwards). The overall success rate of ULA is more than 95%, and that of Delta IV rocket is 100%. Now ULA in the United States is fully developing the next generation of Fire Rocket.Below is the Delta 4 Heavy RocketSpaceX, one of the many companies in the United States, is a technology madman named Musk (the owner of Tesla, if you don't know him). Having Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Rocket, Falcon Heavy Rocket is the most powerful heavy rocket in the world, but also the cheapest heavy rocket. SpaceX is the only company in the world with large rocket recovery technology.Here's the Heavy FalconULA has the world's best hydrogen and oxygen engine RS series, SpaceX has the world's best methane engine Raptor series, is the world's only full flow staged combustion cycle liquid oxygen engine, SpaceX also has the world's most reliable and inexpensive liquid oxygen kerosene engine Merlin series, SpaceX has been completed in more than two years. It has become a remarkable success in 49 successive launches.The Raptor engine is as followsU.S. Boeing, ULA is a joint venture between Loma and Boeing, and Boeing itself has an aerospace subsidiary. The company is working hard to develop a super rocket, SLS, that surpasses Saturn V. Once the rocket is flying, it will be a milestone for the United States to surpass itself. Here are the SLS under constructionBut it is interesting to note that competition within the United States has become intense. SpaceX is developing a BFR rocket, whose performance parameters surpass SLS in an all-round way. If SLS is 30 years ahead of other countries, the gap between success of BFR is amazing. The thrust of SLS is 4000 tons, but the BFR design target is 8000 tons. BFR:Apart from ULA, Boeing and SpaceX, the blue origin of the United States also has space ambitions. Blue origin in the United States, the current progress of blue origin is slower than the above three, but there are also excellent progress. The new Glen rocket engine BE-4, designed by Blue Origin, has completed full-power test run.Engines are the most difficult part of a large rocket to conquer. Maybe the first flight of the New Glenn rocket will take place in the next two years.In addition, the United States has American Orbital Science Corporation (40% of the interceptor missile market, 55% of the small communications satellite market and 60% of the small launch vehicle market), Sierra Nevada Mountain Company (small space shuttle), Bigelow Space Company (the main product space station, the largest six times the international space station), XCOR Astronautics Corporation. Division (Suborbital Spacecraft), Virgin Galaxy, Rocketlab and so on. \u77e5\u4e4e\u89c6\u9891 6. Aviation Industry Ten of the world's top civil aircraft companies, the United States occupies five. Boeing, as the world's number one airline, occupies more than 50% of the market share, followed by 30% of French Airbus, in addition to the United States there are Gulf Stream, Senas and other small and medium-sized aircraft well-known companies. The United States is the second largest aeronautical giant, and General Motors is in the absolute dominant position in the market. GE9X engine, the landmark product, is the top aeronautical engine at present. General Motors has 40% market share, followed by Ronald Ronald, the United Kingdom, with 22% market share. Pratt &amp; Whitney has a 9% market share, and its F135 engine developed for the F35 in 2005 is probably the strongest engine in fighter aircraft. At the same time, with its terrible industrial manufacturing capability, F135 engines can produce 130 units a year. F135 engines:In the early years, V2500/RB211/D-30KP-2 and other engines in other countries were not significantly weaker than those in the United States at the same time, but now this has fallen into a situation where the gap is widening.Boeing Aircraft with GE9X:F35 vertical takeoff and landing:7. Biological Industry The United States continues the momentum of widening disparities in other areas. In the United States, Amgen Enjin, Gilead Sciences Geely, Biogen Idec Biogene, Celgene Sell Gene, Allergan and Regeneron rank in the world TOP10.In addition to bio-research companies, the United States has further expanded its monopoly position in bio-related agents, materials, instruments and other related enterprises, such as Invitrogen, Amresco, Gibco, MP, BD, Pierce, Sigma and so on. Biological equipment: Kodak, Thermo Fisher, Gilson, Bio-rad and so on. Thermo, in particular, has great advantages in centrifuges, quantitative analysis sensors and other fields. Thermo centrifuge:8. Economic aspects The United States is the only country with a population of over 100 million in the top 23 GDP per capita, 24th Edition  In finance textbooks, it has been mentioned that the stock market can be used as a barometer of a country's economic strength.9. Military aspects Let's not go into details in this regard. Two examples are given: years ago, the small partners of F16/F15 included JAS-39, Gripen NG, Rafale, Typhoon, Mirage 2000, MiG-35, Su 30SM, Su 33, Su 34, Su 35, Fighter-10B, Fighter-11B and so on. Now F22 (1997)/F35 (2006) has been produced on a large scale (F22 184 + 8 test machines / F35 totals 380 in the world) for more than 20 years and more than 10 years, which can not be compared with F22 (1997)/F35 in terms of technology and scale. F22\uff1aThe aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, serving in 1961\uff1aThe Kitty Hawk is accompanied by the Kuznetsov at the same level, but over the past 60 years, the United States has developed the first generation of enterprise-class aircraft carriers (94,000 tons full nuclear power in 1961), the second generation of Nimitz-class aircraft carriers (104,200 tons full nuclear power in 1975), and the third generation of Ford-class aircraft carriers (1120 in 2017). There is also no follower, and no other country has the industrial capability to manufacture the 1961 US corporate aircraft carrier. Ford Class Aircraft Carrier Construction in 2017\uff1aAn aircraft carrier battle group consists of one aircraft carrier, two to three air defense cruisers or destroyers, two to three anti-submarine drive frigates, one to two attack nuclear submarines, and one to two logistical support ships, totaling 7 to 11 ships. There are 11 such aircraft carrier formations in the United States. The military side does not need to elaborate on this area which may be the greatest advantage of the United States. Some countries in the military field have reached the world-class level in some areas, but overall, the gap between China and the United States has narrowed in a small range, such as China's 055 missile destroyer/cruiser, Russia's S series air defense missiles, nuclear submarines, etc. The macro-wide gap is widening. 10. Energy industry The United States accounts for 90% of the world's shale oil production. Thanks to the technology of energy development, the dependence of the United States on overseas crude oil has declined dramatically. In contrast, developed countries and many developing countries are increasingly dependent on overseas crude oil. U.S. Energy External Dependence Curve\uff1aThe United States has the largest number of nuclear power plants.11. Interesting aspects to note When science and technology develop to a certain extent, it is possible to promote the emergence of new industries. Because manufacturing, integrated circuits, materials, solar energy and so on have been greatly improved. Many technology companies in the United States are beginning to create new industries. For example, when the once-popular VR is temporarily in silence and money in many countries, the U.S. Army intends to cooperate with technology companies to build a simulated battlefield. In the United States, the popularization of VR game equipment in Internet cafes and game halls is widespread. American companies even launch many small VRs. Movies... Of course, following the style of this reply, let's not talk about these \"low-end\". For a long time, developed countries have been living in a sparsely populated mode. It is very difficult for developed countries to enter their homes with optical fibers. Therefore, the network has become a problem for non-urban residents in developed countries. Later, many American companies have studied satellite interaction on the basis of substantial improvements in manufacturing, integrated circuits, materials and solar energy in recent years. Networking, if it can be achieved through technology, will not only be the domestic satellite user market of the United States, but also include 4.1 billion global air passengers and employees, 300 million seafarers and employees, about 5% - 10% (150 million - 300 million) of the 3 billion people in remote areas, the quality network demanders of the affluent classes, and 300 million times. About outdoor travel explorers and so on, how large can this market industry scale? Conservative estimates are more than $10 billion. The main companies developing this technology tree in the United States are OneWeb, SpaceX, Amazon and so on. They basically use Ka Ku band. OneWeb took the lead in launching several satellites for networking testing early this year, and SpaceX launched 60 technology verification satellites, and Amazon submitted its application to the FCC in time. OneWeb received financial and technical support from Airbus, Qualcomm, Coca-Cola, Soft Court of Japan, Ministry of Defense and other companies. In mid-year, OneWeb succeeded in Satellite Internet in Korea, with a delay of about 30-40MS and 400 Mbps per capita to watch 4K network videos of oil pipelines. This delay and speed is their goal. There are more than enough users. After the successful completion of the perfect test, OneWeb and ESA quickly reached 27 orders for mass launches in an attempt to seize the market. The cheapest large rocket launcher described here is SpaceX, but the two companies are direct competitors on the satellite Internet, so they choose to cooperate with ESA commercial launchers. OneWeb's Florida plant can produce two Internet communications satellites a day. At the same time, SpaceX is unwilling to show its weakness and wants to play a large, direct laser communication between satellites on the basis of OneWeb technology. SpaceX's first 60 verification satellites were launched into orbit in the first half of 2019.According to the news, the production capacity of SpaceX's satellite production line can reach 8 per day. SpaceX has scheduled to launch at least 120 more satellites into orbit twice in the second half of the year. This competition of Satellite Internet lets us wait and see. Of course, there are many technology companies in the United States, especially start-ups. Their daily task is to integrate the current rapid development of basic disciplines and technological innovation, and combine these scientific and technological theories and engineering capabilities to create a new product in a small way and create a new one in a big way. New industries, many familiar NBA stars invest in such enterprises. Summary of the dividing line ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Physics knows that there is a term called acceleration. The greatest premise of the decline of the United States is that the acceleration of acceleration has disappeared. If the United States has acceleration all the time, even if the acceleration of the United States is decreasing, the speed of development is still increasing from the physical point of view. The acceleration of 10 and 1 is accelerating. As long as there is acceleration, the United States will have a steady stream of nutrients from home and abroad to grow into the next Boeing, Pfizer, SpaceX and other enterprises. SpaceX successfully launched the heavy Falcon in a week, received 10W resumes at home and abroad, a large number of graduates such as Stanford, MIT, this is a good thing. A model of mutual promotion. In the US recession, let's wait until the acceleration of the US is negative before we discuss it. It's all tool translation. I just want you to have a look at different opinions.",

            "No. But where the U.S. is in trouble, it\u2019s often the victim of its own success. Progress and decline aren\u2019t linear. In a way, they\u2019re just feeding off each other.

Progress and decline aren\u2019t linear. In a way, they\u2019re just feeding off each other. If you look at the decline of other countries, especially empires, some of them went over a cliff because of their remarkable success. Some of the reasons people cite for the \u201cdecline of the U.S.\u201d are just the perennial progressivist complaining, even about the progress they themselves brought about. Other reasons are more serious and a little harder to grapple with. Huge topic, but just to hone in on a few\u2026 The affordable housing crisis So, why were homes and land cheaper to acquire in the U.S. in, let\u2019s say, 1870? Partly because of the mass eviction \u2014 often at gunpoint \u2014 of the previous occupants of all that land. Cheap farms for poor, desperate Norwegians and Irish on the Western frontier: OK. Did they just walk into the land of freebies? Was societly inherently more just in 1870? I don\u2019t think so: a combination of chauvinistic European and American imperialism, horses, six-shooters, torn-up treaties and disease ravaging American Indian populations are partly what made your cheap land and houses possible. \u201cLand and houses were cheap back then.\u201d At what cost? I live in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, widely considered one of the most successful cities in the U.S. In a way, though, it\u2019s a victim of its own success. There are plenty of problems here. Homes and apartments, by Midwestern standards, aren\u2019t cheap. I pay $800 to share a house with three other guys. Is $800 for a room in a shared house the mark of the decline of America? Actually, no it\u2019s not! It means the city at large is prospering, because when thousands of people move to Minneapolis every year to grab a slice of the pie (I did that), that creates a scramble for affordable housing. The basic law of supply and demand sucks\u2026 but it\u2019s understandable. Let me stick with Minneapolis just for a second to illustrate the point. I\u2019ve been a big critic of gentrification, another nail in America\u2019s coffin. And I wish we could find healthier solutions to this. But\u2026. Just a few blocks north of where I work in downtown Minneapolis, there\u2019s the old Warehouse District. A few blocks south and east, you\u2019ll find the old Pillsbury flour mills, hulks of old grain elevators, relics of rail yards, and a big woolen mill that\u2019s no longer producing coats and blankets. One building used to make Creamette noodles up in the Warehouse District. Along the Mississippi River, there\u2019s also the Gateway District, which just 50 years ago was a vile shithole full of drunks and day laborers and dirty smoke from trains and smokestacks. It was Skid Row, then. Now it\u2019s next to Whole Foods. It\u2019s sparkling clean. If you wander up into the Warehouse District, it\u2019s kind of a sad place today. I call it the home of zombie yuppies, living in luxury lofts built in the shells of noodle factories. Those factories either moved out to the edge of town (more space for greater production), or to other countries, partly because corrupt labor unions drove them out. (Labor unions were good, overall, and they accomplished some great things for American workers. But ultimately, progress bit us in the butt when unpatriotic, greedy companies reacted against vitriolic and corrupt labor unions. Suddenly, companies were out. They moved to China or Mexico.) A loft in a former factory will probably set you back $1,500 today. A fortune. But what else could the city have done with those empty warehouses and factories? Bulldozed them into the river? Taxpayers would have had to foot the bill for turning them into affordable housing. The greedy developers got there first. The gentrification kind of sucks, but the fact that there\u2019s enough high-paying jobs in the city for people to live in luxury lofts means that there\u2019s more than one side to the story. Minneapolis is also having an affordable housing crisis because most of the houses built before 1960 were single-family homes. Where would you build more? Thirty miles out in suburbia? Thousands of people move here, housing is limited, and landlords raise rent to get top-dollar. It\u2019s a vicious cycle brought about by\u2026 the city\u2019s own economic success. Most progressives and pessimists will just sit back and complain about the situation. Remarkably few of them have a workable solution, fueled by actual economic incentives. Industrial decline I grew up in Indiana (Rust Belt), lived in North Carolina (former impoverished tobacco and cotton country transformed by IBM), and I\u2019ve lived on the outskirts of Pittsburgh and Detroit (classic Rust Belt). I\u2019ve seen industrial and agricultural decline. It\u2019s real. I\u2019ve also seen the downside of Pittsburgh\u2019s resurrection as a city, after it almost flat-lined when the steel industry left. Pittsburgh\u2019s amazing success today, as tech moves in, will ultimately kill it, because it makes Pittsburgh unaffordable to live in. I would agree that it\u2019s the mark of ultimate decline. So, what\u2019s your solution? Bring steel back? I don\u2019t think so\u2026. America\u2019s industrial decline didn\u2019t just happen because of job outsourcing \u2014 though that was tragic and real. The even bigger reason is because of technological whiz-kids inventing machines that replaced human beings. The remarkable success of our universities, ranked as the best in the world, turned out the geniuses whose inventions are now eating away at the working class. When progressivists talk about \u201cgreedy corporations\u201d as the cancer that\u2019s devouring America\u2026. OK, that\u2019s not completely untrue, but the painful restructuring of industry and the towns that industry was based in is much more complicated than that. Behind every lay-off, there\u2019s more than a fat, greedy boss. Technological \u201cprogress\u201d is a huge culprit, too. Coal in West Virginia? A lot of reasonable people think that phasing out dirty coal is progress. Unfortunately, many towns had basically no other reason for their existence other than dragging coal out of the side of a mountain. Their decline should have been seen from a million miles away, back in 1920, just like timber towns in the North Woods, who were bound-determined to cut every tree in sight down, then they wondered why their lumber towns disappeared. These towns weren\u2019t built for sustainability to start with. Why are we suddenly surprised, shocked and hurt that they\u2019re vanishing now? It\u2019s totally understandable to lose your home and livelihood when coal or, for that matter, ketchup takes a nose-dive. But it wasn\u2019t a nose-dive, was it? In some industries, it was an inevitable descent. Political blinders\u201cThe U.S. is decline,\u201d say most progressives \u2014 and a lot of conservatives.So, after impressive strides forward for women, immigrants, \u201cpeople of color,\u201d and gays and lesbians \u2014 I don\u2019t think anybody would argue that the U.S. is worse for them today than it was 100 years ago \u2014 now the U.S. is failing? Mmm, nope.\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of religion.\u201dThe U.S. is less religious than it\u2019s ever been. I know a Catholic church in St. Paul getting bulldozed this week because of declining membership. (The flipside is that it\u2019s getting bulldozed because the German-language immersion school next door is bursting with students and needs space. \u201cDecline\u201d is rarely simple or linear, right?)\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of homelessness.\u201dHomelessness is a serious issue. But the homeless are flocking to otherwise booming cities for a good reason. Those cities are doing pretty well. It\u2019s not terribly different in Europe, either, where the homeless rates in some cities are through the roof. Because those cities are a success.\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of mass shootings.\u201dNo. Gun crime is at historic lows. The \u201970s and \u201980s were a shitload more dangerous. Part of the problem is just that the definition of \u201cmass shooting\u201d got redefined and people are weaponizing the mass shootings themselves to diagnose other kinds of decay. The U.S. unquestionably has one the highest rates of gun violence in the world, and we have a lot of psychological problems that fuel this. But when four gang members blow each other away in a drug deal gone bad \u2014 classified as a \u201cmass shooting\u201d \u2014 sorry, my sympathy diminishes.\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of white supremacist-driven mass shootings.\u201dPartly true. But most of these crimes have been committed by disturbed young men. I\u2019m not exactly a \u201cmen\u2019s rights\u201d advocate, but men do get remarkably shafted, and few people have sympathy for them, simply because they\u2019re white and have a penis. Then these critics go out of their way not only to announce how little they care, but how much they actively hate white men.Honestly, some of shooters would have turned out better if they\u2019d just gotten laid. Don\u2019t underestimate the amount of sexual frustration behind men becoming mass murderers. But the roots are also in economics, culture, childish tribalistic politics, and in pornography. Gun control is a bandaid on gangrene if you don\u2019t address why men are so angry, alienated, lost and frustrated. If America is in decline, it\u2019s partly because some people simply don\u2019t care about this issue involving men, and even go out of their way to rub salt in wounds.And if you think white supremacy is where it was in 1920 or 1950, during America\u2019s heyday\u2026. you\u2019re delusional.\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of expensive college education.\u201dAnd that\u2019s largely because students begged and pleaded for expensive add-ons; because schools have expensive sports programs (these could be cut tomorrow, but campuses would drown in tears); because bloated bureaucrats have useless jobs (ditto, though without the tears); and because a lot of students choose (insanely) to go to school out-of-state (which quadruples the cost of your education.)By the way, when you eventually provide \u201cfree\u201d (i.e., taxpayer-funded) education, you\u2019ll deepen the housing crisis in already expensive college towns, once students flock in and landlords hike up the rent to squeeze some of that taxpayer-funded largesse. And the loan companies will walk in next, offering loans not on tuition but on rent. Then when it turns out that a lot of these students weren\u2019t serious about getting an education and just drop out, they\u2019re beholden to loan companies for $20,000 in rent. Good luck with that. Another \u201cfreebie.\u201d\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of bad infrastructure.\u201dAnd that\u2019s partly because of the enormous amount of commerce beating those roads to pieces.I live in a city where a bunch of people drowned in the Mississippi when the I-35 W bridge collapsed. But even that was the result of poor engineering 50 years ago, on a bridge weighted down by people in the actual process of doing repairs. I present that metaphor for a reason. That\u2019s America in a nutshell.\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of mentally ill people on our streets.\u201dThey\u2019ve always been around. We just decided it was inhumane to stick \u2018em behind walls in \u201cloony bins,\u201d where they used to get castrated. (Psst\u2026. \u201cbins\u201d is a synonym for \u201ctrash can.\u201d Not a nice place to consider. Those places were horrible.)\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of illegal immigration and \u2018concentration camps\u2019 on the border.\u201dAnd yet the Democrat-run Congress prefers postponing a solution until 2021. Meanwhile, it refuses to pass a bill to change laws, reform Customs and Border Protection regulations, and hire only Hispanic border patrol agents \u2014 whether that\u2019s on the Mexican border or at airports in New York City. Considering that CBP is already over 50% Hispanic, I say make it 100% so that the myth can finally be put to rest that CBP and TSA are \u201cwhite supremacist organizations.\u201d They are not.\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of \u2018widespread hatred of immigrants.\u2019\u201dTotal baloney. For every door slammed in the face of an immigrant by one genuine bigot \u2014 who are very real, and always have been \u2014 ten doors are standing wide open with 20 Americans standing there making sure they stay open and helping people through.I\u2019ve worked alongside immigrants from everywhere from Mexico to Kurdistan. Most of them would have preferred to stay at home, but they recognize that the U.S. has serious pros and cons \u2014 like every country does \u2014 and that the overall pros outweigh the cons.\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of political polarization.\u201dGuilty as charged. But we\u2019ve got an awfully long way to go before we\u2019re Spain in 1936, or Syria about 8 years ago. In a way, we\u2019re not half as polarized as we were during the Vietnam War, and certainly not as much as we were during the American Civil War, when several hundred thousand people died because the supposedly wise Founding Fathers found it inconvenient to abolish slavery. Several genuinely failed states would love to be the U.S., even in 2019.It seems to me like a genuine example of white privilege that some white folks can complain about how bad it is here, when they won the evolutionary jackpot by being born in a country as comparatively easy and peaceful to live in as the United States is in 2019. That\u2019s textbook white privilege.\u201cThe U.S. is in decline because of healthcare costs.\u201dHuge debacle. So, provide more solutions and fewer complaints. Then maybe we\u2019ll get somewhere. Provide options.At least we have amazing healthcare. We just have to increase the affordability of it. \u201cFirst-world problem.\u201dThe U.S. will eventually collapse, like all societies do. But the European Union will almost certainly be in the grave first, probably in the next decade. The United Kingdom might actually be terminal as I write this. If Scotland leaves and Northern Ireland joins the Irish Republic, the country that spawned the U.S. will be broken up. Spain might not last another decade. And if climate change turns out to be as bad as experts predict, China and India came to the table too late. Canada will be the laughing stock of the world if it keeps walking the path it\u2019s on right now. Who knows about Russia. I don\u2019t see a country governed by mobsters going very far. Personally, I\u2019d bank on a sustainable farm in Chile or just join the Amish in Wisconsin if I want some assurance that my kids and grandkids will be doing OK in 50\u2013100 years. (The Amish wear some funny clothes but at least they know how to feed themselves.) As much as I dislike some real problems in the U.S., we\u2019ve always had problems. And they aren\u2019t like putting a man on Pluto. They\u2019re partly the outcome of progress itself. Considering that we\u2019re also living in the most peaceful period of human history since the last Ice Age, that\u2019s another reason to be optimistic. Haters always gonna hate. But all in all, the U.S. is not on the verge of a cliff, despite the enormous amount of immature schadenfreude some people take in our real problems. And when we do go over the cliff, a lot of folks are coming down with us. We\u2019re your ball and chain. Some of you will see the watery depths right alongside us.",

HOWEVER - Here are the 20 BIGGEST \u201cculture shocks\u201d for me personally (in no specific order). 1. The partition/walls in the college/public/work bathrooms don\u2019t go all the way down to the floor and I felt exposed while sitting on the pot! (The \u201cwalls\u201d in the restrooms don\u2019t go all the way down because it\u2019s easier to clean and mop).2. I\u2019d never had fast food before coming to the States (we didn't have McDonald's or Burger King when I was a kid) and I\u2019ll never ever forget my FIRST bite of McDonald\u2019s burger and SMELL of those sesame seeds. (You won\u2019t notice that wiff of sesame seeds on the bun over time but THAT first bite was unreal).3. Having dinner at 5pm/early. College Cafeteria hours 4:30 -7:00pm so we had to get there early to get the best tables!I was used to having dinner at 9 pm all my childhood life. So, in Ohio, come 10pm and it was always Papa John\u2019s pizza as a late night snack in college.4. Looking LEFT -RIGHT -LEFT while crossing the streets. (Streets where I grew up, you look right - left- right. Ummm, ya, its not a big deal but its a deal).5. FRIENDLY and APPROACHABLE people. You can talk to just about anyone about anything casual be it a checkout line or at a bar\u2026.whatever the case may be.6. SO many timezones in one country! And, you throw in DST - though this was not culturally shocking - it was cool as hell! Especially, watching sports on the west coast living in the east coast etc - your days are lengthy so is your live entertainment on TV - get the drift.In India, there is only one time zone. So, if you live in Calcutta (east coast), you\u2019ll notice that it gets dark much earlier even in summer and that\u2019s because its a huge country with ONE Central time zone). Also. If a sporting event starts at 7pm in the east coast then by 10pm there is nothing kicking off on India's west coast because it's too late - you know what I mean!7. TIPPING. While its a pleasure to tip 15% - 25% now, growing up in a different corner of the world - tipping was something we never did with pleasure!(I\u2019m just telling you how it was - we seldom tipped growing up in India).8.

And I had some general impressions on both: 1- People are so friendly. In fact, too friendly for someone like me, lol. Everyone chats with you like they've known you for a while. They ask \u201chow are you today?\" and answer in length something like \u201coh not doing my best given the weather but other that it's all good\" with a bunch of giggles and smiles. Not to mention, the waiters constantly check on us, asking if we need something. Having been raised in Kuwait, the small chat is usually kept to the very bare minimum. And how are yous are replied to with 2 words no more. Not only that, but Americans also apologize furiously and sincerely for things that look very normal to me. People would apologize deeply that they couldn't help you find something or that they had to do something that caused you a minute inconvenience. I found it sweet but way too deep for interaction between strangers. But that's just a matter of what I'm used to. 2- Traffic light for every lane.I had never seen or heard about this before I landed in the US. I would look up and there is 4-5 traffic lights for one street only ! My husband then explained to me that the right or left lanes can sometimes move when the others aren't, hence each has their own traffic light. In Kuwait there is usually one traffic light on each side of the street is all.3- Diversity in products. You can ask my husband how my first visit to target then Walmart went. I was basically like a child in an enormous candy store. There is a huge number of products suitable for everything. I found hair products in huge numbers for each hair type. I found makeup shades with huge ranges. Given that back home, accepting diversity isn't that big of a trend yet, I had to get myself some supplies. 4- Doing everything yourself. Call me spoiled, but back home I never fill up my gas tank myself, or carry my luggage into an hotel, or check myself out of a supermarket without interacting with a cashier worker. But in the US, I had to it all myself. However, the most shocking thing I had to do myself is this: We finished eating in a restaurant, so I informed the waitress the I wanted my food for takeaway. So she came, left this carton on the table then walked away:If my husband hadn't explained to me that this is normal there, I would've been pissed at the poor service and laziness. But it was just the norm as I had to do to pack my food into boxes in a couple of places after that. 5- Asking for a bag and a straw. Being so environmentally conscious isn't a big thing yet back home, so I was definitely taken by surprise that I have to go out of my way to ask for a bag or a straw for my drink. Most people didn't get bags if they purchased few things and some had their own bags with them. 6- Interaction with the waiters. When I went to restaurants with my husband in different countries, I never understood what he was doing. We'd want our cheque but he kept sitting there only to tell me that no one's looking at us yet. So I would just raise a hand and shout \u201cexcuse me\". Then I came to the US and I realized that service there is all about eye contact. You close the menu, they see that and come pick it up and get your order. You need the cheque, you give them a look and they know that you need something and come right away. Everyone in my family thought that's hilarious. If I kept waiting for a waiter to look at me, I'd spend the night in a restaurant every week over here. And of course, I was not used to tipping at all and forgot to do it all the time. In fact, I had no clue how to tip when paying with a credit card until my husband showed me. You basically write the amount you want to tip on the receipt. I still think that giving 20% of the receipt as a tip is way too much. But I guess I have to follow the norms because the system is very different over there. 7-Calories on the menu. Everything on the menu has the calories written next to it. Thank you for ruining my chance to have a guilt-free dessert America ! Lol. I definitely see how it's useful for others though.. just not to someone as obsessive as me. 8- Dogs everywhere. I had a vague idea about this\u2026 but oh boy, I underestimated the size of it. There were dogs everywhere I went. The supermarkets, airports, houses, elevators and so on. In the few hours I spent in the airport of San Francisco, I've seen more dogs than I see in Kuwait for weeks. 9- The bathrooms are shocking. This has been mentioned by most people before for a reason. There is no squirter/ hose/ bidet. You only use toilet paper. I forgot that most of the time and therefore didn't prepare for it so I had to keep wetting tissues before using the toilet.Also, I had no clue how to shower without drains on the floor. Back home, we have a drain in the bathroom. So even if you spilled a ton of water on the floor, you simply push it into the hole with a squeegee in the ground and you're good.So my husband showed me that I have to shut the shower curtains tight- as I don't have any at home. And that I should keep the towel very close to me to dry myself before leaving the shower and so on. 10- The houses are modest and not as fancy as I expected. I had always thought that everyone in the US lived in a huge fancy house as shown in hollywood movies. One time I even squabbled with my husband because he wanted to live in a house. I said \u201c I don't want to have to clean all that much all the time !\u201d. He explained to me again and again that it's not that much bigger than an apartment but I wasn't convinced. And I wasn't the only one. One of the things my family asked me is \u201cdoes their house (my in-laws) look like the one from home alone?\u201d.But to my surprise, houses can be as small as you want them to be. From the inside, when it's a one-storey house, it looks exactly like an appartment. So basically, they were like apartments sliced up into units, instead of being gathered in a building. It was quite the informative trip for sure.",

Visits I enjoyed.EDIT First of all, thank you for all the upvotes \u2013 its my first time experiencing the massive upvote \u2018high\u2019. Secondly, I should\u2019ve written \u2018feeling forced to tip\u2019 instead. Surely there is no law forcing you to tip, but waiters make very clear that you need to tip. Since a tip by definition is voluntary, I think \u2018service charge\u2019 would be a better description as someone suggested. Better yet: businesses start paying normal wages and put on signs that tips are not required but voluntary. Thirdly, I have only visited NY and Atlanta and penned down this entire list. I think that people who say \u2018only those two, and you think this shit of the entire US!\u2019 mean to say \u2018I don\u2019t recognise my area in your list\u2019. I understand that. However, you can\u2019t expect me to visit every inch of the US to be allowed to make a statement regarding the country. Last, and most importantly, I realise that the list is negative. I\u2019d like to stress that even though I wrote that list, I had a great time during my stay, that I have met many and befriended several great American people, and that the US is a wonderful country. I might be visiting soon, and I\u2019m really eager to go!",
            "I\u2019m going to steer clear of the interesting facts that are horrifically obvious or have been done to death in other answers (\u201cRhode Island is the smallest state,\u201d for example).

I\u2019m going for the wack factor here, people. Buckle up. Alabama - full of rocket scientistsHuntsville, Alabama is known as \u201cthe rocket capital of the world.\u201d The Marshall Space Flight Center, activated on July 1, 1960, was responsible for the creation of the Jupiter C rocket (which propelled the first U.S. satellite into orbit) and also built the Saturn V rocket (which launched the Apollo 11 spacecraft). Yes, that\u2019s right: Alabama, at one point, was the home of the world\u2019s highest concentration of rocket scientists. And here you thought Alabama was full of nothing but racist hicks, didn\u2019t you? Alaska - a bit warmer than you thoughtThink it doesn\u2019t get that hot in Alaska? A record high of 100 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded at Fort Yukon in 1915. (Just in case you were curious, the record low was -80 degrees Fahrenheit, recorded in 1971 at Prospect Creek Camp.) Arizona - where the fishing\u2019s fineDespite being one of the most notoriously arid and desert-coated states in the country, Arizona has two native species of trout\u2014one of which, the Apache trout, is found only in Arizona. Unsurprisingly, it\u2019s the official state fish. Arkansas - diamonds in the roughArkansas is a girl\u2019s best friend. The largest and most valuable diamonds ever found in the U.S. were discovered in the state, including the 8.52-carat Esperanza gem discovered in 2015 (pictured above; estimated value $1 million). Arkansas is jam-packed with gems, minerals, ores, and semi-precious stones. The Crater of Diamonds State Park in Pike County allows visitors to search for precious and semi-precious stones, including diamonds, quartz, amethyst, agate, jasper, and garnet. California - an agricultural giantBetter known for the Hollywood film industry and Silicon Valley, California\u2019s real economic powerhouse is its agriculture. More turkeys are raised in California than in any other state, so raise a glass to the Golden State next Thanksgiving. California also produces 300,000 tons of grapes (and 17 million gallons of wine) a year, plus 20% of the nation\u2019s milk and simply staggering amounts of fruit, vegetables, beef, and chicken. Almost all of America\u2019s almonds, figs, apricots, kiwi fruit, olives, dates, nectarines, prunes, pistachios, and walnuts are grown in California\u2014and almost 100% of America\u2019s commercially grown artichokes as well. True story: in 1948, a pretty 22-year-old woman named Norma Jean Baker was crowned California\u2019s first \u201cArtichoke Queen\u201d in Castroville, a few miles north of Monterey (a hotbed of artichoke cultivation). She went on to become actress and bombshell Marilyn Monroe. Colorado - pretty far up thereThey don\u2019t call it \u201cmile-high\u201d for nothing. Not only is Colorado\u2019s largest city, Denver, a mile above sea level, but Colorado also has the highest mean altitude of any state in the country. The highest paved road in North America (14,258 feet at its highest point), the highest auto tunnel in the world (11,000 feet), and the highest incorporated city in the United States (Leadville) are all located in Colorado. Seventy-five percent of all United States soil higher than 10,000 feet is in Colorado. And the views in Colorado, unsurprisingly, are breathtaking. The poet Katharine Lee Bates was inspired to write \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d in 1893, after she and some of her coworkers climbed to the 14,000-foot summit of Pike\u2019s Peak (pictured above). Connecticut - birthplace of the hamburgerBeing one of America\u2019s oldest states, Connecticut is a land of firsts. After copper was discovered in Simsbury in 1705, America\u2019s first copper coins were minted in Connecticut in 1737. America\u2019s oldest public library\u2014the Scoville Memorial Library\u2014started up in Salisbury in 1771, after the owner of a local blast furnace solicited contributions from the community and bought 200 books in London to start the collection. America\u2019s first phone book was published in New Haven in 1878 (it only had 50 names in it). The idea for the Polaroid camera was born at a boy\u2019s camp in Connecticut in 1922, with the first camera being sold in 1934. The world\u2019s first practical helicopter, the VS-300, took flight in Stratford in 1939. But those probably aren\u2019t the best and most beloved of Connecticut\u2019s \u201cfirsts\u201d\u2014America\u2019s first hamburger was served in New Haven in 1900, at a spot called \u201cLouis\u2019s Lunch.\u201d According to local legend, a customer asked owner Louis Lassen if the \u201cground steak trimmings\u201d they\u2019d just ordered could be served to go. Lassen slid the ground beef patty between a pair of bread slices, and presto! Burger-ception. Delaware - workin\u2019 on the night shiftReggae legend Bob Marley resided in Delaware from 1965 to 1977, working at the Chrysler plant in Newark and for the Dupont Company, saving up money to move back to Jamaica and start a record company. His song \u201cNight Shift\u201d (one of my favorites by Marley, actually) is rumored to be based on his time there. How apropos that Marley, spokesman for the downtrodden and oppressed, should take up residence in Delaware, a hub of the Underground Railroad. Pennsylvania-born Quaker Thomas Garrett, a close friend and benefactor of Harriet Tubman, was a \u201cstationmaster\u201d for the Underground Railroad in Delaware in the years leading up to the American Civil War. He is thought to have helped over 2,000 escaped slaves reach safety; Garrett\u2019s personal (and very modest) estimate was 2,700. Now that\u2019s workin\u2019 on the night shift. Florida - crocs and gators, gators and crocsEven by American standards, Florida is a weird place. For starters, it\u2019s the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators exist side by side (in the Everglades). Another fun Florida fact: Saint Augustine is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the continental U.S., having been founded by the Spanish in 1565. (I couldn\u2019t decide which fact was more interesting, so I included them both.) Georgia - Blackbeard\u2019s hideout, maybeNotorious buccaneer Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, terrorized the Caribbean and the southeast coast of British North America in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Legends say he may have had a hideout on Blackbeard Island just off the coast of Georgia, and may even have buried some of his treasure there. Either way, the United States Congress set aside 3,000 acres as the \u201cBlackbeard Island Wilderness Area\u201d in 1975. Hawaii - what isn\u2019t interesting about it?There as many interesting facts about Hawaii as there are grains of sand on its beaches. Let me throw a few at ya:Hawaii is the only U.S. state which grows coffee.There are only 13 letters in the Hawaiian alphabet\u2014five vowels and eight consonants.Waialeale Mountain on the island of Kauai is considered the wettest place on earth, with an average rainfall of 488 inches.The only royal palace in the United States, Iolani Palace, is located on Oahu.The biggest contiguous ranch in the United States is located on the Big Island of Hawai\u2019i\u2014the Parker Ranch, at roughly 480,000 acres.The Big Island is home to the world\u2019s most active volcano\u2014Kilauea.The two tallest mountains in the Pacific (Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa) are also located on the Big Island.Idaho - deep canyons, tall waterfallsThought the deepest canyon in the United States was that big one in Arizona? Nope. Hells Canyon in western Idaho is the deepest river gorge in the country at 7,993 feet\u2014about 1,900 feet deeper than the Grand Canyon. Oh, and Shoshone Falls, also on the Snake River (in Twin Falls), is 212 feet high\u201445 feet higher than Niagara. Illinois - one of the flattest flats that ever flattened a flatIllinois is the second-flattest of the lower 48 states. (The only flatter state is Florida, with all those low-lying coastal plains.) It lies, on average, 600 feet above sea level, except down near the Mississippi River, where it reaches as low as 279 feet above sea level. The highest point in the whole state, Charles Mound, is a mere 1,235 feet above sea level. That\u2019s less than a thousand feet of elevation change in an area of almost 58,000 square miles. Quite a difference from Colorado, eh? Indiana - the popcorn capital of the worldHawaii grows coffee. Georgia grows the \u201cthree P\u2019s\u201d\u2014peaches, peanuts, and pecans. California grows\u2026almost everything. Indiana, however, grows corn. Almost half of the state\u2019s farmland is devoted to growing corn. Not surprising, given that Indiana is the home state of Orville Redenbacher, and produces 20% of the United States\u2019 popcorn. In 2014, Indiana farmers planted 91,000 acres of corn just for popcorn. Iowa - rivers, lakes, and mammoth bonesDespite lying almost smack-dab in the middle of the United States, Iowa is the only state whose eastern and western borders are 100% water. It is bounded to the west by the Missouri River and to the east by the Mississippi. Much like Illinois, Iowa is quite flat\u2014mashed into a pancake by the glaciers that marched across North America during the last Ice Age. The Iowa Great Lakes in Dickinson County were scooped out by these glaciers. Not surprisingly, Iowa is saturated with woolly mammoth bones\u2014the big hairy critters once dominated the region. Kansas - they got a lotta breadIn addition to being the state that\u2019s less flat than Iowa only because it\u2019s got a hill or two, Kansas is America\u2019s breadbasket. Almost literally. In 1990, Kansas wheat farmers produced enough wheat to make 33 billion loaves of bread\u2014enough to give every single human being on Earth six loaves apiece. The Kansan wheat farmers broke their record in 1997, producing enough wheat to make 35.9 billion loaves of bread. Dang, dude. Pass the butter and jam\u2026 Kentucky - not just a part of Virginia anymoreBluegrass. The Kentucky Derby. Kentucky Fried Chicken. Mammoth Cave. Fort Knox. The song \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s famous for a lot of things, but not many folks know that Kentucky wasn\u2019t even its own state in the beginning. It was originally a county of Virginia. Kentuckians got fed up with having to travel such a long distance to the capital of Richmond, and successfully petitioned to break away and become the 15th state in 1792. Louisiana - where you won\u2019t make the parish lineMaybe this isn\u2019t the most interesting fact about the Bayou State (supposedly it\u2019s where the turducken was invented, popularized by the chef Paul Prudhomme in his New Orleans restaurant K-Paul in the late 1980s). But I\u2019ll throw it out there anyway. Louisiana is the only state in the Union (aside from Alaska) that doesn\u2019t have counties. (Even Hawaii has counties, for Pete\u2019s sake. Alaska has boroughs and census-designated areas.) Louisiana has \u201cparishes\u201d instead. Maine - secluded but beautifulMaine is kind of a lonely place. It\u2019s the only state in the lower 48 that borders just one other state and the only state in the country with a one-syllable name. Mainers speak a completely different language than the rest of the United States. But despite these setbacks, Maine has a lot to offer. Ninety percent of the nation\u2019s toothpick supply is produced in Maine, and they also supply 40% of the nation\u2019s lobster. Jaw-droppingly beautiful Acadia National Park (pictured above, in a photo that won a U.S. Department of the Interior photo contest in 2018) consistently ranks in the top ten most-visited national parks in the country. Oh, and Maine is also home to a rather obscure horror writer named Stephen King. Maryland - home of the U.S. Naval AcademyColorado has the U.S. Air Force Academy, and New York\u2019s got West Point, but Maryland has the U.S. Naval Academy, founded October 10, 1845. (Notable graduates include state governors, ambassadors, cabinet members, Congressmen, Nobel Prize winners, astronauts, and even a U.S. president.) The location of the academy isn\u2019t surprising. Sixteen of Maryland\u2019s 23 counties touch the tidal basin, and Maryland, despite being less than 12,500 miles square, has 4,431 miles of shoreline. Annapolis has been called the sailing capital of the world. Massachusetts - birthplace of basketballAnother New England state with a rich history of \u201cfirsts,\u201d Massachusetts can boast of the very first subway system in the United States; the invention of the sport of volleyball (originally called \u201cmintonette\u201d); the namesake of the Fig Newton (Newton, Massachusetts); America\u2019s first planned industrial city (Lowell); America\u2019s first public park (Boston Common, 1634); and the very first game of basketball, played in Springfield in 1891. That may have something to do with why the Basketball Hall of Fame is located in the state. Michigan - land of magicMichigan doesn\u2019t just do cars and rock and roll\u2014the state leads the U.S. in the production of peat, gypsum, and iron ore, and was once home to the world\u2019s largest cement plant, the world\u2019s biggest limestone quarry, and the world\u2019s biggest herd of Holstein cows. But Michigan is known for mass-producing something else, too, something a bit more\u2026whimsical. The city of Colon is the self-proclaimed \u201cMagic Capital of the World.\u201d Every summer the city hosts a four-day magician\u2019s convention, to which amateur and professional magicians flock from across the country. There\u2019s a magic museum, a Magician\u2019s Walk of Fame, and of course, a Magic Capital Cemetery\u2014dozens of famous magicians are buried there. (Or are they?) Minnesota - land o\u2019 lakesJolly Green Giant canned vegetables. Scotch tape. Wheaties. The Bundt pan. Bisquick. Water skiing. The pop-up toaster. Armored cars (and Tonka trucks). The stapler. The Mayo Clinic. Paul Bunyan. The Mall of America\u2014the largest shopping center in America, the size of 78 football fields (9.5 million square feet), with 520 stores, 60 restaurants, and an indoor theme park. Minnesota is famous for a lot of stuff, but it\u2019s most famous for its lakes. Known as \u201cthe Land of 10,000 Lakes,\u201d Minnesota actually has 11,842 lakes over ten acres in area. Again\u2014blame those damn glaciers. Mississippi - performing surgical wondersThe first lung transplant and the first heart transplant were both performed in Mississippi, in 1963 and 1964 respectively. Missouri - birthplace of the world's tallest-ever manAside from inventing iced tea and ice cream cones, and falling victim to the deadliest tornado in U.S. history (the Tri-State Tornado of 1925, which claimed 695 lives and destroyed 15,000 homes), Missouri is also the birthplace of the tallest man in modern medical history, Robert Pershing Wadlow (8 feet 11.1 inches tall). EDIT: On another Quoran's suggestion, I've amended my answer to say that Wadlow was born in Missouri. He lived most of his life in Illinois. Montana - where the deer, elk, and antelope outnumber the humansNo two ways about it: this state is just plain wild. I\u2019m gonna pull a Hawaii here and throw some more facts at ya:Largest migratory herd of elk in the country.Largest breeding population of trumpeter swans in the lower 48.Most likely more golden eagles than any other state.Largest nesting population of common loons in the western U.S.A moose population of 8,000\u2014not bad, considering moose were thought to be extinct south of the Canadian border in 1900.Largest grizzly bear population in the lower 48.One average square mile of Montana contains 1.4 elk, 1.4 pronghorn antelope, and 3.3 deer.The Freezeout Lake Wildlife Management Area may contain as many as 300,000 snow geese and 10,000 tundra swans during a typical migration season.Forty-six of Montana\u2019s fifty-six counties are \u201cfrontier counties,\u201d with an average population density of less than six people per square mile.Nebraska - drinkin\u2019 the Kool-AidConnecticut\u2019s got hamburgers, New York has French fries, Missouri has ice cream cones, and Florida has Gatorade\u2026but Nebraska is the birthplace of Kool-Aid. Back in the 1920s, Edwin Perkins of Hastings invented a sweet punch he called \u201cFruit Smack.\u201d But he needed a way to cut production costs. In 1927, he hit upon the idea of selling it as a powder (in his mother\u2019s kitchen, no less) and the rest is history. Nevada - the last bastion of the world\u2019s oldest professionLet\u2019s skip the obvious stuff\u2014casinos, the mob, nuclear testing, Hoover Dam. Let\u2019s get sexy. Nevada is the only state in the Union where some forms of prostitution are still legal. Prostitution is legal in every county in Nevada except Clark County, wherein lies Las Vegas. (Sorry, tourists.) Even so, it is illegal for \u201cfreelance\u201d prostitutes to ply their trade\u2014prostitution is illegal except for that practiced in the state\u2019s 21 licensed brothels, such as the famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Mound House. New Hampshire - pretty dang windy, as it turns outThought Chicago was the Windy City? Think again. The winds and weather around Mount Washington, New Hampshire are notoriously wacky and unpredictable. On the afternoon of April 12, 1934, the Mount Washington Observatory recorded a wind speed of 231 miles per hour\u2014three times faster than a Category 1 hurricane. (Two other quick New Hampshire facts\u2014the state declared its independence from Britain six months before the Declaration of Independence was signed\u2014way to go, guys. The state\u2019s motto, unsurprisingly, is \u201cLive Free or Die.\u201d) New Jersey - a seething mass of humanityNew Jersey is pretty much the polar opposite of Montana. Every single one of the state\u2019s 21 counties contains, in whole or in part, a metropolitan area. Ninety percent of the state\u2019s population lives in one of those metropolitan areas. The state has the highest population density of any U.S. state\u2014over a thousand people per square mile, which is 13 times the national average. New Jersey\u2014thanks to its proximity to New York, probably\u2014also has the densest and most tangled network of railroads and highways in the country. And yes, Jersey Shore fans\u2014NJ has no fewer than 50 seaside resort towns and cities, which get horrifically busy during the season. New Mexico - high and dryDenver may be the \u201cMile-High City\u201d (a mile, for non-Americans reading this answer, is 5,280 feet, and Denver\u2019s elevation ranges between 5,130 and 5,690 feet). But Santa Fe, the capital of New Mexico, sits at a staggering 7,000 feet. The state is not only high, but also dry\u2014I read somewhere that New Mexico is so arid that 75% of its roads have been left unpaved. They never wash out. New York - always on the verge of a catastrophic subway floodThe trouble with really old cities it\u2019s that it\u2019s pretty dang difficult to modernize them. In New York City\u2019s case, the subway system had to be built below the sewers and storm drains. Over 750 pumps prevent 1.3 million gallons of water from flooding the New York subway system every. Single. Day. I remember reading Alan Weisman\u2019s amazing book The World Without Us, in which he said that the first thing that would happen if humanity suddenly disappeared from the face of the earth is that the New York City subways would flood, and the streets would collapse. North Carolina - flying, jazz, golf, and missing colonistsWhat do aviation, Andrew Jackson, John Coltrane, Nina Simone, and Thelonious Monk all have in common? They were all born in North Carolina. Oh yeah, and it\u2019s also where Babe Ruth hit his first home run, where Arnold Palmer honed his swing (at Wake Forest University), and where the first English colony in North America was established (at Roanoke Island). Yeah, that colony. The one that mysteriously vanished. Oh yeah, and the state\u2019s motto is \u201cEsse quam videri\u201d (\u201cTo be, rather than to seem\u201d). How cool is that? North Dakota - protecting \u201cmom and pop shops\u201dAside from being home to the geographical center of North America (located in Rugby), North Dakota has also become a symbol of the fight against Big Pharma. By North Dakota law, pharmacies must be owned by local pharmacists. You can scour North Dakota from one end to the other and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a Rite-Aid or a Walgreens. The law is intended to protect small business owners from being squeezed out by big chains. Ohio - infrastructure galoreYou might say Ohio had the best interest of its citizens at heart. The city of Cincinnati inaugurated America\u2019s first professional fire department on April 1, 1853. Twelve years later, that same city started up the nation\u2019s first ambulance service. A Dayton shopkeeper invented the cash register in 1879 to keep his customers\u2019 sticky fingers off his profits. The city of Akron was the first to use police cars (or rather, police carriages) in 1899. The city of Cleveland installed the nation\u2019s first traffic light in 1914. Ohio also has a long and loving relationship with rock-\u2019n\u2019-roll and aviation\u2014the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is in Cleveland (and the official state song is \u201cHang On Sloopy\u201d). Ohio is the birthplace of the Wright Brothers and also Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon. Oklahoma - birthplace of the electric guitarWhen you think of the phrase \u201ccoolest state in America,\u201d Oklahoma probably doesn\u2019t spring to mind. But did you know that that\u2019s where the electric guitar was invented? By a fellow called Bob Dunn in 1934? Didn\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think even he knew what he was kicking off. Fun fact: the invention of the electric guitar predates the invention of the parking meter (also invented and implemented in Oklahoma) by a year. Oregon - home of the world\u2019s largest (and most terrifying) organismI could say a lot of things about Oregon\u2014the beautiful coastline, the dormant volcanoes, that really deep lake, the wines, the full-service gas stations\u2014but what I really ought to say is that this state is home to the largest organism on earth. It\u2019s a fungus 2.4 miles wide. It\u2019s called a \u201choney fungus\u201d\u2014an innocuous and dangerously misleading name, in my opinion\u2014and it\u2019s spread itself out over Oregon\u2019s Blue Mountains. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t trust any living thing more than a mile wide. Kill it with fire. Pennsylvania - home of \u201cThe Raven\u201d (yes, that raven)Yet another of those old northeastern states rich in history and \u201cfirsts,\u201d Pennsylvania is the home of Hershey\u2019s chocolate; the first daily newspaper (1784); the first zoo (1859); the first baseball stadium (1909); the first automobile service station (1913); and the first computer (1946). But Pennsylvania\u2019s claim to fame may be even more profound than that. If you go to the rare book department of the Free Library of Philadelphia, you\u2019ll see a taxidermied raven. It was once the pet of Charles Dickens. But the stuffed bird most famously inspired a certain melancholy Baltimore poet named Edgar Allan Poe to write a poem called \u201cThe Raven.\u201d EDIT: This answer previously said that Pennsylvania was part of New England. I've corrected that error on the suggestion of another Quoran. Rhode Island - founded by a true AmericanYes, Rhode Island is the smallest state\u2014let\u2019s get that out of the way. But it\u2019s so much more than that. The colony of Rhode Island was founded by a man who just might have been the most moral American who ever lived. His name was Roger Williams. He was a Puritan minister, author, and theologian who pretty much laid the foundation for the Bill of Rights. Williams was a staunch advocate for religious freedom, firmly supported the separation of church and state, and wanted the colonies to deal fairly with the Native Americans. He was also one of the first abolitionists, way before it was cool. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both acknowledged Williams as a major influence on the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. After being excommunicated by the Puritan leadership for espousing \u201cnew and radical ideas,\u201d Williams founded the Providence Plantations in 1636, offering what he called \u201cliberty of conscience.\u201d If that\u2019s not American, I don\u2019t know what is. South Carolina - shakin\u2019 and quakin\u2019California by no means has a monopoly on earthquakes. On August 31, 1886, an earthquake believed to have registered 7.6 on the Richter scale rocked the city of Charleston, killing over a hundred people, leveling the city, and causing $5.5 million in damages\u2014about $136 million in today\u2019s currency. South Dakota - dyin\u2019 place of a Western legendAmong its many claims to fame\u2014the location of Mount Rushmore, birthplace of Tom Brokaw, homeland of the Sioux nation\u2014South Dakota is also famous for being the place where the legendary gunfighter Wild Bill Hickok met his end. \u2019Twas in Deadwood, in 1876, when jealous gambler Jack McCall shot Hickok in the back of the head at point-blank range while Hickok was playing poker. In Hickok\u2019s hand were aces and eights\u2014known forever after as \u201cthe dead man\u2019s hand.\u201d Though Hickok\u2019s star had faded over the years, his folk hero status was such that Jack McCall\u2019s trial was swift and merciless. In 1877, he was convicted of murder, hanged, and buried in an unmarked grave in Yankton. Tennessee - home of the braveTennessee\u2019s history is a martial one. Tennessee earned its nickname (\u201cthe Volunteer State\u201d) due to the valor exhibited by Tennessean volunteers who fought under Andrew Jackson during the Battle of New Orleans at the close of the War of 1812. Davy Crockett, the famous American frontiersman, soldier, folk hero, and politician, was born in Tennessee and went on to die a glorious death at the Alamo in 1836 during the Texas Revolution. Tennesee sent more soldiers to fight in the American Civil War than any other state\u2014120,000 to the Confederacy and 31,000 to the Union. Alvin C. York, born in Pall Mall, became one of the most decorated soldiers of World War I. More than 3,600 Tennessee National Guardsmen participated in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Shield. Aside from its indisputable martial prowess, Tennessee is also famous for whiskey (Jack Daniels, anyone?) and music\u2014it\u2019s the birthplace of country music (and Dolly Parton), the location of Elvis Presley\u2019s home of Graceland, and the home of the Grand Ole Opry, the longest-running live radio program in the world. It\u2019s been going nonstop since 1925. Texas - a pretty damn big placeI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to go with the most obvious interesting fact about Texas, guys. Texas is big. Like, mega-big. The state\u2019s King Ranch is larger than the state of Rhode Island. The city of El Paso is closer to Needles, California (two states away) than it is to Dallas. The state is home to the country\u2019s largest population of whitetail deer and is estimated to be home to 16 million head of cattle. Texas makes up 7.4% of the United States\u2019 total area all by itself. Texas\u2019s largest county (Brewster) is 6,208 square miles\u2014larger than the state of Connecticut (and the nation of Montenegro). Texas itself is 268,597 square miles, which would make it the 40th largest country if it was a country by itself\u2014slightly larger than Burma, and slightly smaller than Morocco. Utah - addicted to gelatinThe state seems to be a little bit obsessed with Jell-O. Salt Lake City has the highest per-capita consumption of the gelatinous stuff in the entire world. Vermont - milk and maple syrupVermont seems to be a bit\u2026removed from the rest of American culture. A mere 22% of Vermonters attend church regularly. The state capital, Montpelier, doesn\u2019t have a McDonalds. Like, anywhere. And until 1996, there were no Walmarts in the state either. (Vermont, much like North Dakota, tends to favor local businesses over nationwide chains.) Vermont has the highest proportion of dairy cows to people\u2014its 1,000 dairy farms and 135,000 cows produce 2.3 billion pounds of milk per annum. Vermont also produces more maple syrup than any other state. (And they\u2019re pretty snobby about it, too.) Virginia - steeped in historyNo discussion of American history is complete without Virginia. It was the site of the first permanent English settlement in North America (Jamestown\u2014sorry you disappeared there, Roanoke). It was the location of the first Thanksgiving. The birthplace of eight U.S. presidents (and six president\u2019s wives). The site of the British surrender during the Revolutionary War (Yorktown). The location of numerous battles of the American Civil War, and the location of the Confederate capital (Richmond). The home base of the U.S. Navy\u2019s Atlantic fleet (Norfolk). Rumor has it that 50% of the people in the United States live within a 500-mile radius of Richmond, Virginia\u2026in which case the Old Dominion would be the \u201ccenter\u201d of the United States, even more so than Rugby, North Dakota. Washington - home of the world\u2019s biggest buildingWhile Washington State is famous for a number of things\u2014being the only state named after a U.S. president, growing fantastic apples, having more glaciers than the other lower 48 states combined, being the birthplace of both Jimi Hendrix and Bing Crosby\u2014Washington is probably best known for being the headquarters of some of America\u2019s wealthiest and most well-known corporations, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Boeing. It\u2019s also home to the largest building in the world\u2014the Boeing assembly plant in Everett, which is a staggering 4,280,000 square feet in area and 472 million cubic feet in volume. West Virginia - birthplace of the ballsiest test pilot in historyYet another piece of the state of Virginia that broke away, West Virginia split away from its mother state in 1861, after Virginia voted to secede from the Union. Only 17 of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner of the state were in favor of secession, so a convention was held in Wheeling and the notion of becoming an independent state was floated. In 1863, President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation formally admitting West Virginia to the Union, making WV the only state to be admitted to the Union via presidential proclamation. The state is probably most famous for two things: producing 15% of America\u2019s coal and producing Chuck Yeager, the heroic WWII triple ace and test pilot who broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1 in 1947. Wisconsin - milk, cheese, cranberries, and\u2026ginseng?Wisconsin sees Vermont\u2019s 1,000 dairy farms and raises \u2019em 9,920. Wisconsin\u2019s cows produce 25.4% of the country\u2019s cheese and 13.5% of its milk. Wisconsin\u2019s abundance of arable land allows it to grow 60% of the nation\u2019s cranberries and 97% of its ginseng. Wisconsin also grows plenty of green peas, snap peas, carrots, cucumbers, potatoes, cherries, apples, and corn. The city of Milwaukee was once home to four of the world\u2019s biggest producers of beer: Schlitz, Blatz, Pabst, and Miller. Only Miller remains, but Wisconsin\u2019s craft brew scene is thriving. Wisconsin is also the birthplace of architect Frank Lloyd Wright, magician and escape artist Harry Houdini, entertainer Chris Farley, actor and producer Orson Welles, author Laura Ingalls Wilder, painter Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, circus impresarios Charles and John Ringling, and pianist Liberace. WyomingUniversal suffrage! Wyoming was the first state to give women the right to vote, in 1869\u201351 years before the 19th Amendment was ratified. And there you have it, Quora.

            "Here is something that should blow the mind of any decent American: There are slave plantations still in operation today in parts of the South. Don\u2019t believe me?

Let me introduce you to the place formally known as Louisiana State Penitentiary, but much more commonly referred to by the plantation\u2019s original name: Angola.Slave-Trader and plantation owner Isaac Franklin purchased the land for the Angola Plantation in the 1830s. The name was chosen for the location in Africa from which the enslaved workers had been taken, and the plantation became an extremely profitable source for the cotton trade. After the Civil War, the plantation was bought by Confederate Major Samuel Lawrence James.Major James saw an opportunity for the plantation\u2019s profits to continue, despite the setback caused by abolition. The 13th Amendment, which largely ended the practice of slavery, had one notable loophole. The Amendment reads:Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.In other words, people could still be subjected to involuntary servitude so long as they had been convicted of a crime. James saw that he could continue to operate the plantation under the Convict lease system, which allowed plantation owners and private companies to \u201clease\u201d unpaid involuntary workers from the state, effectively replacing chattel slavery with penal servitude. Not only did the plantation continue to operate, but he used his involuntary labor force to build levees and railroads across the state. At the same time, the State of Louisiana passed a series of laws directly aimed at keeping a sizable involuntary workforce. Numerous minor infractions were given sizable fines, and if the accused parties were unable to pay (keep in mind that recently-freed slaves had very little money), the only other option was to work off their debt on a plantation like Angola. In 1901, the Angola Plantation was formally incorporated into the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections and opened as a state prison farm. It kept the name of the slave plantation in practice, and is still referred to as \u201cAngola\u201d to this day: The name of the penitentiary is well known to many fans of blues music, as the place where Allen Lomax traveled to document the guitar of several inmates, most notably one Huddie Ledbetter, better known as Lead Belly (pictured in the foreground below): Despite its importance to the history of Blues Music, the fact remains the Angola continued to operate almost exactly as it had before emancipation throughout the 20th Century, and continues to this day. The passage of various prison reforms has made some difference in the treatment of inmates, but those reforms have largely been driven by the reports of the horrific conditions in what has been repeatedly declared \u201cThe Worst Prison in America.\u201d One such report came after an act of protest by the prisoners in 1952, almost a full century after the abolition of slavery. In an act of defiance against the horrific work conditions, 31 prisoners cut their own Achilles\u2019 tendons in order to cripple themselves, and the article published in Collier\u2019s Magazine created a shocked outcry for reform. Despite the slow reforms, merely looking at pictures of Angola over the course of its history are enough to show that some elements of the Slavery that the Civil War was fought to end are still alive and well in America today:         To put this problem in context, here is a Louisiana sheriff speaking in October of 2017:WATCH.In 38 seconds Steve Prattor, Sheriff of Caddo Parish in Louisiana, tells you why he REALLY likes keeping \"good\" Black men in jail. pic.twitter.com/7YtxixE1rU\u2014 Shaun King (@ShaunKing) October 12, 2017\nThank you for reading. Hopefully, if more Americans can be made aware of the horrific legacy of our greatest national shame in our current penal system, our country can push for the criminal justice reform it so desperately needs. This is not a partisan issue, it is a human issue and every decent American, liberal or conservative, should be opposed to this victimization of our fellow citizens.",

And in much of northeastern Jersey, that's pretty much the way it is, honestly. If I never set foot in Essex County again, I could live the rest of my life with no regrets. But much of the rest of the state is quite lovely. A lot of northwest Jersey, like Warren County, is bucolic and peaceful, with small communities and a lot of friendly people. Pinelands National Reserve, which encompasses much of the southern half of the state, is a region of tremendous beauty and biodiversity, and was our first national reserve here in the U.S. Within the reserve are the Pine Barrens, which have their own haunting beauty. (Just watch out for the Jersey Devil!) The fine white sand beaches of Absecon Island are fabulous, and Cape May and Long Beach Island are paradises for beach bums in summer. Southwestern Jersey is full of lovely farmland, and is the origin of New Jersey's nickname, the \u201cGarden State\u201d; the region produces large quantities of the nation's spinach, lettuce, bell peppers, peaches, blueberries, and cranberries, as well as fabulous sweet corn and famous Jersey beefsteak tomatoes (yum). My brother lives in that area, around midway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City, and in his rural little town, you'd never know you were in the most densely populated state in the union. So, I like Jersey. I kind of think of it as that annoying little sibling that you like to give a hard time to, but also have tremendous affection for and whose back you'll always have when the chips are down.",

Maybe because NJ is so strongly associated with Italian descendant American culture? It was interesting for me to read these answers as NJ is practically my second home with my closest family and many friends located there, though I actually live in NYC, only a bridge length away from the state. Between the Sopranos, Jersey Shore, and the smelly industrial corridor near Elizabeth on the New Jersey Turnpike, most Americans who do have any association with NJ usually only have this along with endless jokes from New Yorkers about the state But New Jersey is actually an incredibly beautiful state filled with so many Norman Rockwell quintessential American towns of large Victorians and Center Hall Colonials with waving American Flags, kids riding bycicles in the streets, charming Main Streets, the best ranked public schools in the US, small mountains, lakes, rivers, the 2nd largest water falls after Niagara, Revolutionary War sites and cemeteries, a coastline filled with a range of colorful beach towns, and sandwiched between New York City and Philadelphia, and a short drive to our capital, Washington DC. It's extremely diverse with a very large Korean and Indian - and of course, Italian population (though not the largest, nearby Connecticut has the most). You can find amazing \u201cItalian\u201d food here, which is obviously a different cuisine than the numerous regional cuisines found all over Italy, but when you're craving it, it's equally delicious. New Jerseyians have more accent variations for such a small state than most of the US. Northerners sound completely different from the Southerners. And they each have their own slangs and expressions. Some of the larger cities are poor and struggling (Camden is the poster child for urban poverty and decay, though the city has improved drastically in the last 10 years) and there are plenty of ugly parts of the state, but every state has that dichotomy. In terms of celebrities, native New Jersisans include Meryl Streep, Martha Stewart, Whitney Houston, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Bon Jovi, Susan Sarandon and of course, Frank Sinatra, and many, many more. The US is an enormous country and there is only so much of it we can see, so unfortunately we tend to only get our information from what we see on TV and through popular culture. And in the case of New Jersey, that includes what we see on the quick drive through the industrial corridor between Newark Airport and NYC. And New Jersisans are just as guilty of that as anyone else when thinking of other places. We tend to think everyone in Texas has a gun and a cowboy hat.  ",

They\u2019re also very lively and loud. Go into any eatery and dinner, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. They\u2019re also very traditional for the most and they go all out on the 4th of July, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New years. The food in NJ was awesome. Diners, Italian restaurants, pizzeria's, delis, steak houses, and even Chinese food were awesome. I\u2019d also say that the Chinese food in Jersey was better than Chinese food on the west coast. I didn\u2019t know a soul in Jersey, when I got there. I made friends, and I was always invited over for Christmas and Thanksgiving. I loved the fact that NJ had all four seasons, with the fall being the best out of them all. Overall NJ was pretty damn awesome for the most part. I didn\u2019t like the fact that it was an expensive state to live in. Automobile insurance was very expensive. I paid around 3 grand a year for full coverage and I had a good driving record\u2026no tickets or accidents. I also got frustrated because we didn\u2019t have google maps back 95\u201398 and I got lost, quite a bit, because roads were designed like a bowl of noodles. Of course that stuff is minor. I would\u2019ve had stayed in NJ, instead of moving back to CA, if I could do it all over again, do the best I could to recover my glandular issue/brain tumor, looked for a better job, at a company that appreciated my efforts and continued on.

            "After the Declaration was passed on July 4, 1776, Congress ordered that it be sent to a printer named John Dunlap. About 200 copies of the Dunlap Broadside were printed and distributed throughout the colonies, with John Hancock\u2019s name printed at the bottom. Today, 26 copies remain. The signers sent a copy of the Declaration to King George III with only two names on it: John Hancock and Charles Thomson, the President and the Secretary of the Continental Congress. Why?

About 200 copies of the Dunlap Broadside were printed and distributed throughout the colonies, with John Hancock\u2019s name printed at the bottom. Today, 26 copies remain. The signers sent a copy of the Declaration to King George III with only two names on it: John Hancock and Charles Thomson, the President and the Secretary of the Continental Congress. Why? They didn\u2019t want the British to have the names of all those committing treason! Remember these names. Once the document was signed and delivered to King George III, the colonies now recognized themselves as the United States. But how did King George III feel about these accusations? What was his point of view? How did Great Britain react to the Declaration of Independence? The British Reply When Great Britain first received the Declaration of Independence, the country was silent. To them, this was another annoyance from the colonies. The colonists had sent previous letters to King George III that had been ignored, but this was the first time that they had declared themselves free from Great Britain. You know how you feel when a little child continues to ask you for the same thing over and over again, and eventually, you stop listening? This was how King George III viewed the colonies. They were a nuisance, but relatively harmless. Or so he thought. The government hired John Lind, an English politician and pamphleteer, to write a rebuttal to the declaration. He wrote Answer to the Declaration of the American Congress, a reply that tried to pick apart the Declaration of Independence.Lind focused on the issue of slavery, saying that the colonists were actually angry that King George III had offered freedom to the slaves. Lind even mocked the writers for stating, 'All men are created equal\u2026', yet they allowed slavery. Of course, all of this was just a distraction. The colonists really paid no attention to the pamphlet. Following this, King George III officially declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion. By August of 1776, the King ordered soldiers to be sent to the colonies. According to a British source: \u201cIn spite of the outbreak of war in 1775, the legislatures of the American colonies were only gradually persuaded to demand independence; the Declaration was not finally agreed until 4 July 1776. The British government was determined to resist the rebellion but met with military reverses in America and a vociferous, if divided, opposition at home. By the beginning of 1778 the French were also threatening to intervene. At this time the opposition demanded an enquiry into the state of the nation and called for papers, to reveal, amongst other things, the ineffectiveness of the Prohibitory Act as a means of restoring America to the king's 'peace'. These papers, which were laid before the House of Lords on 20 Jan 1778, included this copy of the American Declaration of Independence. The motion for an enquiry was defeated on 2 February. The war was formally ended by the Treaty of Paris, which was signed on 3 September 1783.\u201d So we know the Declaration was at the House of Lords on January 20, 1778. British Reply to the Declaration: Summary & Analysis - Video & Lesson Transcript | Study.com So do we know where the original is? Was this the original sent to George III? The one presented to the House of Lords on January 20, 1778 is in the archives of Parliament.This a copy of the Declaration presented to Parliament in January 1778. Copy of the American Declaration of Independence But is this the one sent to King George in 1776? The article accompanying the copy does not say. However, there is additional evidence.Here is another view of the same document. If you look on the spine it shows that in a letter from commissioners dated in August 1776. This would correspond with the sending of the original Declaration.Finally, look at the names on the signature lines. They are John Hancock and Charles Thomson, the ones mentioned above. Therefore, it would appear the copy stored in the archives of Parliament is the one sent by the colonies. Recently another copy of the Declaration was found in England. But it was printed 10 years after the Declaration was signed and could not be the one sent to George III. How Did a Copy of the Declaration of Independence End Up in England? - Medill News Service",

Iran doesn\u2019t fund questionable madarsas (Saudis do). America and its allies threaten Iran infinitely more than Iran threatens America. The scariest fact of our geopolitical climate is that the United States and Saudi Arabia has funded terrorist groups (Al-Qaeda, Taliban and others) that threaten western countries whereas Iran isn't any direct real threat to America. America doesn't have to pick sides. India manages to have a great relationship with Israel, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Iran.

Americans see this as complete recklessness. To many Americans, more guns equals more security. To Europeans, fewer guns equals more security. The American arms race between invaders and invadees has turned \u201cburglary gone wrong\u201d to an everyday occurrence in the US, while it happens once every two years where I live. Newt Gingrich, when asked about the lessons the US has learned from history as regards foreign relations, answered \u201cThat we must identify and neutralise our enemies\u201d.

For legal and cultural purposes, Americans consider the first day of their official history as a nation to be July 4, 1776, when the official text of the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the Second Continental Congress. This timeline from Wikipedia covers the process accurately: The Declaration of Independence is the statement adopted by the Second Continental Congress meeting at the Pennsylvania State House (Independence Hall) in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies, then at war with the Kingdom of Great Britain, regarded themselves as thirteen newly independent sovereign states, and no longer under British rule. Instead they formed a new nation\u2014the United States of America. A committee of five had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when Congress voted on independence. . . . The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. The next day, John Adams wrote to his wife Abigail: \"The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America.\" But Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the Declaration of Independence was signed. After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost, and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand. Jefferson's original draft, complete with changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, and Jefferson's notes of changes made by Congress, are preserved at the Library of Congress. The best known version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the official document, is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19, and signed primarily on August 2.\u201d The preamble of the declaration is considered to be the most important part of the document. It marks the beginning of the modern political age in Western culture, in which all political authority stems from the consent of the populace, rather than from the will of a deity, a monarchy, or the property rights of an aristocracy: IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. \u2014 Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. \u2014 And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.

As everyone in that room understood at the time, signing this document made them traitors to the crown of Great Britain and would be the evidence that sent them to be executed for High Treason in London. Per Wiki: The form of execution once suffered by traitors was often (though not invariably) torturous. The condemned could not walk or be carried to the place of execution; the sentence required that they were to be drawn: they might be dragged along the ground, but were normally tied onto a hurdle which was drawn to the place of execution by a horse. A man would then be hanged by a noose around the neck, but not so as to die: there would be no \"drop\" to break the neck. Whilst still alive, he would be cut down and allowed to drop to the ground, stripped of his clothes, his genitals cut off, his viscera pulled out and burnt before his own eyes, and other organs would be torn out of his body. The body would be decapitated, and cut into four quarters. The body parts would be at the disposal of the Sovereign, and generally they would be gibbeted or publicly displayed as a warning . . . In addition to being tortured and executed, a traitor was also deemed \"attainted\". The first consequence of attainder was forfeiture; all lands and estates of a traitor were forever forfeit to the Crown. A second consequence was corruption of blood; the attainted person could neither inherit property, nor transmit it to his or her descendants. Despite persistent attempts by political and moral critics of the United States, by scholars looking for a new topic for a dissertation, and by history students looking for contrarian bits of knowledge so they can be more hip and cool then their fellow students, the importance of this document in modern human history remains. It defines the source of governmental authority as being the \u201cconsent of the governed\u201d\u2014as an ill-defined group, as it happens\u2014rather then the will of a conqueror, of a tribe, of an individual or family property owner, or of a god.",

Scientifical experiments on live specimens[1] . Mass-sterilization, genocide, starvation, forced labor until death from exhaustion, deliveries of cheap \u201chuman resources\u201d[2](4) for the industry, use of \u201chuman resources\u201d (menschematerial) as raw material to produce chemicals, soap, even skins\u2026 Last but not least, our hippie Nazis went on a crusade against \u201cJewish bacterias\u201d, which they genuinely deemed non-human animals. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard of it. So, in their own referential, this constitutes cruelty towards animals. But hey, Hitler loved his dogs, right?Hitler protected natureHeavy industry, but especially chemical industries or synthetic oil production, were booming under his rule[3]. Huge tracts of lands were replaced by autobahns. Environmental regulations vanished[4]. So much so that it was commonplace for British, American, French industrials in the 30\u2019s to praise it: \u201cat least in Germany we can do business [unimpeded by regulations]\u201d.Hitler cared about ecological systemsThat one is true. He literally wanted to carve a \u201cbiotope\u201d (lebensraum) for the German animal race. He cared A LOT about living space. But to exploit it, loot it like if there\u2019s no tomorrow. Nazis understood ecological systems as a zero-sum game[5]: eat or be eaten. Exploit or be exploited. Vampirize, loot, extinguish, or lose your \u201cvital forces\u201d[6]. They pushed the exploitation of nature to paroxystic levels. Note that they weren't the only ones. The dust bowl in the US, the Aral Sea mismanagement in the USSR\u2026 are also testimonies of that era.Hitler was pro-veganHitler was crippled with many health issues, including a spectacularly irritable bowel. Which is why medical doctors advised him to stay away from meat. Which he did. That, we can put to his credit. But was he promoting veganism? No. Meat sources for the German race were protected at all costs, which is one of the single victories his regime achieved: as opposed to 1918, the Germans ended this round without losing any weight. At the expense of everyone else in Europe, granted. But everyone else was more or less animals, and animals are expendable, so\u2026Okay, but\u2026 they were rational! Germans are rationals!Germans? That's debatable. Nazis? Not so much, no. They considered half of modern science as \u201cJewish science\u201d and banned it. Including the nascent ecology. They applauded the Atlantropa project[7] (to dam the Gibraltar straight) to \u201ccreate more farmlands\u201d, while any decent agronomist could foresee it would have turned the Mediterranean basin into a toxic salt desert of epic proportions, and contaminated half of Europe fertile lands with it. Lastly, and my favorite:Hitler wanted to ban cigarettes for health reasonsHe really disliked smokers, yes. Was it for health reasons? No: it was because it renders the \u201chuman resources\u201d unproductives. Same reasoning with alcohol, oversleeping, laziness etc\u2026 meanwhile Hitler himself was a deeply \u201cunproductive\u201d individual by his own metrics, something abundantly commented. He overslept, was unable to concentrate, preferred lunatic ramblings about roman architecture rather than actual conversations, and his laziness was a popular topic behind his back. Alcoholism, meanwhile, was deemed a mental disorder rewarded with work reeducation. Ironic. On the other hand, any addiction making the human resource more productive was perfectly okay, encouraged, laced in chocolates, given to children. Like amphetamines, which quickly became a public health issue hindering the war effort. Long story short, it was never about health. On the other hand, perhaps you see a pattern emerging. It was all about exploitation of the body, of animals (a category including most of mankind), of raw materials, of Nature. There was nothing \u201cgreen\u201d, \u201cecological\u201d in their program. Sadly the average YouTuber seems incapable of gathering actual sources. So loads and loads of disinformation, mindless regurgitating, and the \u201chad he calmed down in 1938 he would be a hero\u201d narrative continues to spread. Had he calmed down in 1938: workers, minorities, and \u201casocials\u201d were already dying gruesome deaths as slaves for IG Farben profits. Unfit \u201canimals\u201d already euthanasied.

Ice, on the other hand, preserves things, delivering an eternal source of punishment for the lost souls. If you ever tried to immerse your hand in icy water, you are aware of how painful it can become, fairly rapidly. But this is not a lesson in physics, only a literary interpretation and our imagination should be free to leap over our rational mind. What caused the river to freeze? A very cold and strong wind, generated by the movement of Lucifer\u2019s wings.If you look carefully, Lucifer has three faces, which unites at the top of the cranium, symbol of pride. Different interpretations have been given during the centuries: for some, Satan needs to be able to survey his kingdom in all directions. The faces have also different colors: vermilion, pale/yellow and black. These may represent the three land masses known at the time: Europe, Middle East/Asia and Africa. In Dante\u2019s presence, Lucifer is also gnawing on three sinners: Judas, Brutus and Cassius. With the help of Virgil, while timing his actions with the rhythm of the Devil\u2019s wing, Dante will climb down his chest into the middle of the earth.

I like the guy enough. But just like his most famous and most over-hyped masterpiece, the painter of Mona Lisa is also one of the most over-hyped artists in history. People look at his drawing of fantasy anatomy, fantasy war machines, fantasy everything else, they think he's not only a fantasy artist, he's also a scientist and engineer. He wasn't. He thought he was. That probably helped feed the hype. When Lorenzo de Medici introduced Da Vinci to the Duke of Milan, he wrote: I introduce to you the best lute player in Italy. And when Da Vinci introduced himself to the Duke of Milan, he consider himself a military engineer. And despite being a complete autodidact and being perceived by the society as a lowly craftsman, he wanted people to see him as a wise intellectual.He's quite handsome, you know.Verrocchio\u2019s David\u2019s face was said to modeled after young Leonardo. But most people remembered him as a wise old learned scholar. He created his own image, the person he wanted to be, and we swallow it whole and perpetuating it 500 years later.

(Color in the conventional sense of the word. There is a different astronomical definition of color of a star which is mathematical.) Stars are black bodies. What is a black body? Black body is any thermodynamical body which only emits heat. Black bodies do not absorb heat. Since stars have such extreme temperatures, it is safe to approximate them as black bodies. This is because you can only absorb heat from objects of higher temperature. (Nearly) all stars are far away from other similar hot bodies, therefore they have no channels to accept any sort of heat. Black bodies are awesome. They emit heat in the form of radiation in space. They have this incredible property that they can emit photons at every frequency. Now just how much energy do they emit at each frequency? They can\u2019t emit equally at all frequencies because there is an infinite range of frequency. Ok so the next sensible relation would be some kind of decaying exponential which reduces with increase in frequency. Finally you could check the graph by using frequency filters on light emitted by the sun. This is what you get:Here is a graph that comes up often when discussing black bodies. This is called the black body curve. We graph the intensity of the photons at every frequency. You can see here that at every single frequency of the visible spectrum we have some sort of light emission. (Ignore those T and \u03bbmax\u03bbmax signs. We will discuss that later.) So we can safely say that the Sun (and all other black bodies) emit blue light, white light, red light and so on. Well we all know, as Newton proved, that white light is nothing but a mix of all colors of light. So this means that the Sun should look white! Now you will point at the \u2018yellow\u2019 Sun in the sky and look at my answer condescendingly remarking, \u201cThat ain\u2019t white and I ain\u2019t color blind.\u201d This actually leads us to our next concept: Rayleigh\u2019s law of scattering. When you look at the Sun in the sky, it is not only you and the Sun. There is also this huge mass of air sitting in the middle, that we call the: Atmosphere. We mostly forget that there is this fluid around us all the time. Wave your hands fast enough and you will feel the presence of this secretive medium you live in. (This is pretty awesome.) Now that \u201cwhite light\u201d, I led you to believe the Sun emits, meets this atmosphere before reaching us. The atmosphere starts pushing this light around. This scattering makes the sky blue and the sun turn red at sunrise and sunset. Now how does this make the Sun yellow? Go back to that graph. Can you see in which range of frequency is the maximum intensity of light emitted? For the Sun, it is in the range for Yellow color. After all the light has been scattered from the Sun, when it finally reaches you the Yellow dominates the other colors because the Sun inherently emits more energy in that spectrum. So you finally see the Sun as yellow. In space, there is no atmosphere. The satellites there look at the Sun as it is: White. Also if you look at the Sun at noon time (when the scattering is the least) does it look yellow or white to you? :)",

In total approximately 70% of incoming radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and the Earth\u2019s surface while around 30% is reflected back to space and does not heat the surface. The Earth radiates energy at wavelengths much longer than the Sun because it is colder. Part of this longwave radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gases which then radiate energy into all directions, including downwards and thereby trapping heat in the atmosphere. There is also such effect, as Albedo...It is the ability of a surface to reflect sunlight (solar radiation). Snow and ice have high albedo \u2013 much of the sunlight hitting surfaces covered with snow and ice bounces back. In contrast, dark earthy surfaces have a low albedo, therefore, they absorb more sunlight. Thus, the proportion of Earth\u2019s surface that is covered by ice and snow affects how much of the Sun\u2019s solar radiation is absorbed, warming the planet, or reflected. Therefore, snow and ice which are covered in soot from pollution no longer reflect sunlight, but absorb it and so melting increases. Blue is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time. Closer to the horizon, the sky fades to a lighter blue or white. I guess, purple means, that it\u00b4s evening or ..bad weather? ..Violet is always there, but we don't detect it as well as we do blue, so blue wins the light wave battle for our eyes. The right conditions have to be met for purple, or violet, to be visible. I don\u00b4t think, that something will change with our Sun in the next 1000000 years...And nor with the atmosphere.

            "Songs can get stuck in your head due to a psychological phenomenon called \"earworms.\" This occurs when a catchy or repetitive song or melody becomes involuntarily stuck in your mind and repeats itself, often without your control. Research suggests that earworms may be related to how the brain processes and stores musical information, as well as how the brain handles repetitive stimuli. Factors such as emotional resonance, recent exposure to the song, and individual differences in cognitive processing may also contribute to this phenomenon.",

The best overview of this theory is Susan Blackmore's book The Meme Machine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meme_Machine By this theory, the most widespread songs will be the ones that get themselves copied for whatever reason, whether they're welcome to their human hosts or not. It's no mystery that I find Duke Ellington melodies catchy, I love his music more than anything. But I intensely dislike Andrew Lloyd Webber, yet I find his songs even catchier than Ellington's. This demands an explanation. In my observation, the stickiest songs are the ones most finely tuned to the limits of your attention span and pattern-seeking tools. Earworms are mostly predictable and repetitive, but just complex and surprising enough to stimulate your pattern-seeking reflex. \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" is easy to memorize, but the brain \"solves\" it so quickly that it doesn't linger endlessly the way Andrew Lloyd Webber songs do. Ellington tunes are repetitive too, but the main motifs are more complex, requiring more attention, and eventually they wear your pattern recognizers out.  The interesting and potentially useful thing about the meme theory of music is that it suggests you can measure the catchiness of a song by the amount of symmetry it contains. Too little symmetry and the song will be too complicated to be memorable. Too much symmetry and your brain will solve the pattern immediately and lose interest. I leave it to the math people how to formalize these parameters, but I've known musicians to try to work them out in an ad hoc way. I have a friend from college (a big Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, by the way) who deliberately set out to write catchy tunes. He'd sit at the piano in the student center playing material he was working on. Then he'd go hang around the nearby snack bar. If anyone there was unconsciously humming what he'd just been playing, he knew he had a winner.",

According to the story, God created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, a paradise where they could live in peace and harmony. God gave them one rule: they could eat from any tree in the garden except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil. If they ate from that tree, God warned, they would surely die. The story goes on to tell how the serpent, a cunning creature, tempted Eve to eat from the forbidden tree. The serpent convinced Eve that God was lying to her, and that if she ate from the tree, she would become like God, knowing good from evil. Eve was tempted by the idea of gaining knowledge and power, and she took a bite of the fruit and shared it with Adam. Despite the fact that the story of Adam and Eve is well-known, the Bible does not actually specify what kind of fruit they ate. The Bible simply says that it was the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Over the centuries, scholars and theologians have speculated about what kind of fruit this might have been. One of the most common theories is that the fruit was an apple. This idea may have been popularized by the fact that the Latin word for apple, \"malum,\" is similar to the Latin word for evil, \"malus.\" Additionally, the apple has long been associated with temptation and sin in Western culture, thanks in part to the story of Adam and Eve. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the fruit in question was actually an apple. The Bible does not provide any clues about the fruit's appearance, and apples are not native to the Middle East, where the story takes place. Some scholars have suggested that the fruit might have been a fig, a pomegranate, or a grape, all of which are native to the region and have symbolic significance in the Bible. Another interpretation of the story suggests that the fruit was not a literal fruit at all, but rather a metaphorical representation of knowledge. In this interpretation, the story of Adam and Eve is a cautionary tale about the dangers of seeking knowledge and power at the expense of obedience to God. By eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were attempting to become like God, but in doing so, they lost their innocence and brought sin and suffering into the world. Ultimately, the question of what fruit Eve ate is one that may never be definitively answered. The story of Adam and Eve is a powerful and enduring myth that has been interpreted in countless ways over the centuries. Whether the fruit in question was an apple, a fig, or something else entirely, the lessons that can be drawn from the story are timeless and universal: the importance of obedience to authority, the dangers of temptation and desire, and the consequences of seeking knowledge without wisdom.

Eve then offered the fruit to Adam, and both of them ate it, leading to their realization of their nakedness and their subsequent expulsion from the Garden of Eden. In Islam (Quran and Hadith): The story of Adam and Eve is also mentioned in the Quran and Islamic tradition. Adam and Hawwa (Eve) were created by Allah (God) and placed in Paradise (Jannah). They were allowed to enjoy everything in Paradise, except for one tree. Satan, known as Iblis, tempted them to eat from the tree, and both Adam and Hawwa succumbed to the temptation. As a result, they were sent down to Earth as part of Allah's plan and were granted repentance. In both traditions, the story emphasizes the concept of free will, the consequences of disobedience, and the importance of seeking repentance. While the specific identity of the forbidden fruit is not mentioned in either tradition, the focus is generally on the moral lessons conveyed by the story rather than the fruit itself.",

It makes no sense at all to imagine that the tree is a kind of tree other than what it is called in the Hebrew Bible, or that the tree of knowledge of good and evil would be just some run of the mill apple or fig tree. Meanwhile, even though the story is written in a concrete manner, the Bible is replete with symbolism that includes eating or drinking of things that are written as specific foods or drinks, but are clearly symbolic. Here are some examples: Leviticus, Chapter 21, verse 22: He may eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. Isaiah, Chapter 3, verse 10: Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Consider Psalms, Chapter 18 that includes verse 21: The tongue has the power of life and death, and those who love it will eat its fruit. Or Proverbs, Chapter 4, verse 17: For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.  The Bible is full of symbolism, and one does not ask, \u201cHey, was that holy bread wheat or rye?\u201d No one asks what kind of \u201cbread\u201d the \u201cbody of Jesus\u201d is, that would be blasphemous, as the bread IS Jesus, right? No one is confused into thinking \u201cthe bread of wickedness\u201d actually refers to some actual kind of bread. And the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, is exactly that. And everything that it symbolizes. Was there actually a tree, actually the eating of a fruit that conferred sudden understanding of good and evil? Or to be even more precise, were Adam and Eve\u2019s eyes closed in some way before they \u201cate\u201d of the fruit? And when they did eat, were their eyes flung open? Here is the passage: He said to the woman, \u201cDid God actually say, \u2018You1 [ https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2/#f1- ] shall not eat of any tree in the garden\u2019?\u201d 2 And the woman said to the serpent, \u201cWe may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, 3 but God said, \u2018You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.\u2019\u201d 4 But the serpent said to the woman, \u201cYou will not surely die. 5 For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d 6 So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise,2 [ https://www.esv.org/Genesis+2/#f2- ] she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. 7 ...",

In the last show, the producers interviewed a Creationist preacher who was making a name for himself, going around the country debunking Evolution, declaring it false, wrong and even evil. The man was not some religious nut. He was college educated, articulate and quite reasonable in the interview. Sorry \u2026 I forgot his name. He was asked the question, \u201cGiven all the incontrovertible proofs of Evolution, why was he so intent on condemning it as false? I was SHOCKED, therefore, when this preacher decided to answer the question truthfully. He said (I\u2019m paraphrasing), that the foundations of Judaism, Christianity and Islam are fundamentally based on the Bible. Remove the Old Testament\u2019s description of the God of Abraham, and all of the stories of HIS creation of the universe and all of life, and man, and so on \u2026. and none of those religions can exist. The preacher explained that if Evolution was true, then the entire story of Genesis was false. Man did not come from the Garden of Eden. Instead, he evolved over billions of years from tiny single-cell organisms. There was no literal Garden of Eden. That means there was no Adam and Eve. They did not exist as actual people. That means there was no \u201ctree of Forbidden Fruit\u201d. It didn\u2019t exist. Consequently, there was no serpent to tempt Eve to convince Adam to eat from the forbidden fruit. That did not happen either. Subsequently, God did not have a reason to get angry, and to condemn Adam and Eve and mankind for their \u201coriginal sin\u201d. Therefore, Adam and Eve and humans were not banished from the Garden of Eden. It didn\u2019t happen. The \u201cGates of Heaven\u201d were not closed to man. It never occurred. Cain did not kill Abel. Man and women were not condemned to a life of toil, pain and suffering because of their act. God was not vengeful and did not bestow his wrath on man. He then got to the real meat of his problem with Evolution. If Genesis did not occur, then the main reason for God sending his son Jesus Christ to Earth, was also bogus. Based on virtually all Christian religions, Christ came to Earth in major part to reopen the gates of Heaven, to atone for man\u2019s original sin and fall from grace in the Garden of Eden. HE is called Christ the Savior, or Christ the Redeemer for precisely that reason. If there was no original sin or fall events, if the story of Genesis was just an allegory and not true, then Christ would not have to come to Earth to atone for them and save man. His entire reason for being would be false. His entire persona as the \u201credeeming\u201d Son of God, sacrificing himself on the cross to atone for man\u2019s sins as EVERY Christian religion preaches, would be based on a lie. This preacher concluded by admitting to the documentary producer that he wanted Christianity to work \u2026 to be believed by the public. He found it to be a valuable addition to the human condition. He believed in its usefulness. If scientific discovery seriously debunked the very basis of Christian religion and weakened it, society would be in much worse shape, according to this preacher\u2019s views. As a result, to protect his religion from this kind of assault, and allow Christianity to flourish, he felt he was duty and honor bound to join the chorus preaching Evolution to be untrue, even knowing deep in his heart that it was true. What this man candidly and truthfully outlined, is exactly correct. Although people (including the Catholic Pope) make weak arguments that Evolution and Christianity can coexist fine, the truth is that they cannot. The Bible is offered as a major PROOF of the Judeo-Christian God. Without it, there is no such religion. It is the very foundation of both religions, as the Quran is for Islam. Genesis not only discusses the origin of man, it includes a major outline of the fall of man from grace, including his traits of arrogance, avarice, lust, anger, murder of brother by brother, etc. God created death and suffering BECAUSE of man\u2019s sin in the garden. If Evolution proves that Genesis did not occur pretty much as described, then the entire story of it becomes just a made-up story, and the primary reason Christ came down to Earth as a God to redeem man and reopen heaven, becomes bogus. You cannot successfully base a strong belief in a religion on a known fiction, once you know the truth. Judaism and Islam too, collapse, since their entire religions are based on the truths of the Old Testament. Edit - March 10 - Many comments below are from Christians who want to keep their religion but also want to support science, so they claim that they do not believe in Genesis as literal truth, but still fully believe in Christianity, AND, you do not have to accept Genesis to be a good Christian. As a lapsed Christian myself, this may be wishful thinking, but is just not true. To prove it, try this thought experiment: Ask 100 Christians the following two questions (but do not explain why you are asking):Do you believe that Jesus Christ was the Son of God who came down to Earth and sacrificed HIS life on the cross to REDEEM humanity from his sins and SAVE humanity and reopen the gates of Heaven?Was not \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d the primary sin God came down to Earth to forgive?If you have any honesty, you will admit that close to 100% of those 100 Christians would answer \u201cyes\u201d to both questions. Obviously! They are both part of the absolute fundamentals of a Christian faith. Answering \u201cYes\u201d to question 2 proves beyond any doubt that folks may claim they don\u2019t take Genesis as literal truth, yet in the next breath, believe its primary claims \u2026 the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, eating of the forbidden fruit and committing that Original Sin. They are not being hypocritical. They are just not realizing that you cannot have Christ redeeming man of his sins, unless you accept that man committed that sin in the first place. This was the point of the Preacher\u2019s argument. He was not an evangelical preacher, he was a pragmatist. If Evolution disproves Genesis, the entire foundation of Christianity collapses. Sorry if that disturbs folks who want to embrace both the religion and Evolution, but \u2026 there it is! So, to answer your question directly, Christianity, Judaism and Islam directly contradict the proofs of Darwinism/Evolution. If you have the courage to ask the question, then the answer is obvious. They cannot coexist logically, spiritually or practically.",

I\u2019ll be honest, this isn\u2019t working as well as I had hoped when I first started answering this question. Seriously, the sheer ignorance involved in conflating the fact of evolution with Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution and then just calling the whole thing \u201cDarwinism\u201d as if it\u2019s just another wacky and unsupported fringe belief is really, really frustrating. Not to mention distracting, since it\u2019s hard to get my mind around the possibility that this might actually be a serious question from somebody who has just heard incorrect terms used and really wants an answer. OK, scratch all that. I\u2019m just going to imagine the question is just, \u201cIs evolution compatible with religion.\u201d If that\u2019s not what you meant to ask, just ignore the rest of this answer, OK? OK. Look, I\u2019m absolutely thrilled to know that the vast majority of religious people have no trouble accepting that evolution is a real thing, that all life on Earth evolved from earlier forms, and that we all share a common ancestor with every other life form on this planet. It makes everybody\u2019s life so much easier when people don\u2019t try to \u201creinterpret\u201d clear facts to suit their religious indoctrination. As such, I really don\u2019t want to upset the apple cart or anything. Except, if I\u2019m being honest here, I have to admit that evolution really, really isn\u2019t compatible with religion (at least not any religion that believes that God has a special purpose for humanity, cares about us any more than he cares about all other life on Earth, has special plans for us in the afterlife, etc.). Everything we know about the process of evolution indicates that it is not a directed process, except to the extent that natural selection leads organisms that are suited to their environment to survive long enough to pass down their genes. Everything else is driven by randomness. Random mutations. Random variations. Random changes in the environment. Throughout the history of life on Earth, species have gone down paths that eventually led to their extinction, become overspecialized, adapted to one environmental change only to suffer when the environment changed again, etc. There\u2019s simply no rational way to reconcile all that with a belief that we are God\u2019s children made in His image, I\u2019m sorry. Is Evolution Compatible with Religion?",
            "The fruit that Eve ate is a well-known story from the Bible, recounted in the book of Genesis. According to the story, God created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, a paradise where they could live in peace and harmony. God gave them one rule: they could eat from any tree in the garden except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil. If they ate from that tree, God warned, they would surely die. The story goes on to tell how the serpent, a cunning creature, tempted Eve to eat from the forbidden tree.

According to the story, God created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, a paradise where they could live in peace and harmony. God gave them one rule: they could eat from any tree in the garden except for the tree of knowledge of good and evil. If they ate from that tree, God warned, they would surely die. The story goes on to tell how the serpent, a cunning creature, tempted Eve to eat from the forbidden tree. The serpent convinced Eve that God was lying to her, and that if she ate from the tree, she would become like God, knowing good from evil. Eve was tempted by the idea of gaining knowledge and power, and she took a bite of the fruit and shared it with Adam. Despite the fact that the story of Adam and Eve is well-known, the Bible does not actually specify what kind of fruit they ate. The Bible simply says that it was the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Over the centuries, scholars and theologians have speculated about what kind of fruit this might have been. One of the most common theories is that the fruit was an apple. This idea may have been popularized by the fact that the Latin word for apple, \"malum,\" is similar to the Latin word for evil, \"malus.\" Additionally, the apple has long been associated with temptation and sin in Western culture, thanks in part to the story of Adam and Eve. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the fruit in question was actually an apple. The Bible does not provide any clues about the fruit's appearance, and apples are not native to the Middle East, where the story takes place. Some scholars have suggested that the fruit might have been a fig, a pomegranate, or a grape, all of which are native to the region and have symbolic significance in the Bible. Another interpretation of the story suggests that the fruit was not a literal fruit at all, but rather a metaphorical representation of knowledge. In this interpretation, the story of Adam and Eve is a cautionary tale about the dangers of seeking knowledge and power at the expense of obedience to God. By eating from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were attempting to become like God, but in doing so, they lost their innocence and brought sin and suffering into the world. Ultimately, the question of what fruit Eve ate is one that may never be definitively answered. The story of Adam and Eve is a powerful and enduring myth that has been interpreted in countless ways over the centuries. Whether the fruit in question was an apple, a fig, or something else entirely, the lessons that can be drawn from the story are timeless and universal: the importance of obedience to authority, the dangers of temptation and desire, and the consequences of seeking knowledge without wisdom.

Apple is also the most numerous fruit from european continent , as prior to 1500 we didn't know many exotic fruits that we know today. It is portrait as an apple as a metaphor.

Europeans in this part, were taller, skinnier, and far better dressed. The clothes men wore were tight relative to my culture. In most parts of my country, these men would be seen as feminine. I\u2019m a patriotic guy, but one downside to our F\u2014U, Murica! attitude: it occasionally blinds us to trends we can afford to adopt, such as wearing clothes that actually fit us. Walking along the sidewalks near the Eiffel Tower:On more than one occasion, I saw a man abruptly cut off the sidewalk in a 90 degree turn and into oncoming traffic, with the confidence of a man dead set on dying. Then, in a bizarre sequence, would begin making gestures at drivers, as if their car did not belong on these streets and in his way. I thought, \u201cTry that in a U.S. city and you\u2019ll get your death wish or a hefty ticket.\u201d People had a relatively even and quiet demeanor that took some getting used to. It was a sharp contrast to the loud, friendly and robust personality that I feel safe defining as American. I was met with horrified looks as I instinctively smiled and said \u201cHello!\u201d to people I passed (and would never see again). I quickly learned that they did not like small talk in these parts. And that if I continued to fire greetings at strangers, they would continue to look at me like a madman. Small talk is, perhaps, an American phenomenon. Us Yankees are corny. Blasting laughter across peaceful coffee houses. Trying to order Hamburgers over exquisite french cuisines. Telling strangers our life story. Trotting along in our baggy clothes amidst a perpetual fashion show, smiling, cornifiably adorable in our blissful ignorance.

A few days later, I went to the university sports complex and there it happened again: footballers were naked in the changing room and I was the only one there with clothes on. A few of my Belgian friends told me that it's normal to be naked in the change room if you are into sports. 2. Ketchup: My housemates find it weird to see me using ketchup with instant ramen noodles or pizza. Belgians prefer to use ketchup only for eating fries and nuggets as far as I know. 3. Salt is no sugar: I noticed that the regular salt used in Belgium(or in Europe) looks similar to the coarse sugar(large crystals) which is sold in India. The typical salt consumed in India looks like tiny particles(finer than sugar). One day, I was having lunch with my office colleagues and one of them asked me to pass the salt. I immediately replied, with confidence, that it's sugar, not salt. Everyone seemed to laugh at me and I realized what just happened right now. Later, I also wondered why the hell would there be a sugar bottle instead of salt. This is what salt looks like:4. Relationships: Europeans are liberal-minded towards relationships. There was an Australian guy with whom I shared an apartment after I arrived in Belgium. He was regularly visited by a kid and his mother. After a few days, I came to know that she was his ex-girlfriend with whom he never got married and they are still great friends raising a kid together. 5. Not dependent anymore: I know a few Belgian guys who stay at their parents' house and paid their room rent. 6. People strictly follow rules and regulations: They are ashamed if they don't do so. Here, almost everyone follows the traffic rules even at late night when there isn't a single car on the road. In Europe, priority is always given to pedestrians, as opposed to in India, where the vehicles(who do not want to stop) are allowed to pass before we even think of crossing the road. Also, there is almost no honking of the car horns.",

Outdoor going cats just take it in stride as the seasons change, though some just hurry out, do their business, cover it, and head back to the residence as quickly as possible. Strays and ferals have no say in the matter, though if they are outside at night they may choose to go under houses or porches, get inside human-built cat shelters, or go inside clumps of cedars or under overhanging branches belonging to coniferous trees. Smokey was an outdoor going cat when this photo was taken in 1961. It was common in those days for all cats to go outside. Winter was just another season.Walking in snow is not the same as in rain. Both are wet, but with rain a cat\u2019s fur gets soaked. In winter snow the cat may feel impeded by the depth of the snow but usually only the paws and lower legs get snow on them and, in clear spaces, cats can shake the snow off. Snow is much less burdensome than rain, as well, because cats have fur coats that provide warmth and protection in snow, but become waterlogged in rain. Cats are curious. Our Velvet loves to check notable changes in weather. Sometimes Velvi, an indoor cat, will tell me she\u2019d like to be carried out during heavy winds, thunderstorms, or blizzards. However, were I to put her on the ground during any of these curious events she would walk quickly to the back door from our driveway and demand to go in. Our late Sasha sensed what snow was. Seeing it once or even a few times was enough to tell her \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out there\u201d and she\u2019d get into her bed or go somewhere so that she could hide. When Barraclaugh was alive he\u2019d beg to go outside in the winter. He\u2019d be put on his leash and he\u2019d lead my mother down the stairs at the front of our house, around the corner to his favorite pee spot, and then he\u2019d urinate and lead mom back up the stairs to get inside as soon as possible. If he could have spoken he\u2019d have proclaimed \u201cIt\u2019s cold out there. I\u2019m just going out to pee. Be right back!\u201d Our present Peach likely thinks Velvet is two bricks short of a load to want to go out to see storms. He likes to watch snow falling from his place by the window but he hates being carried out in the cold and would not at all like the feel of snow underfoot.

Her body will assume the \u201cmeatloaf\u201d position, tightly compressed with paws tucked under her belly instead of spread out, to conserve energy. If you have miniblinds and/or rugs, the cat will locate the sunny spots on the floor and follow them as they move through the day, to sit where it is warmest. Really cold cats, even indoors, will shiver; you can feel them trembling. If your cat begins shivering uncontrollably, showing ocular or nasal discharge, sneezes, doesn't eat or drink normally, acts tender-sore and stiff, coughs or otherwise basically acts like you do when you have a bad cold, please either call or bundle your cat up in a carrier and go to your vet; colds can become febrile, with pneumonia, bronchitis, dehydration, aches and pains, as well as needing to be distinguished from illnesses or viruses infectious to other cats in your vicinity, where meds may be helpful, and comforting. Warm blankets\u2026the clothes dryer or even a closely monitored microwave oven is a beautiful thing for heating throw-blankets or towels or t-shirts for wrapping and warming up seriously chilled cats. Cats love to build a nest and then just sleep. Outdoor cats that are cold during the day will look for sunny spots in the grass, garages, under sheds, also areas like dumpsters and abandoned possum dens that offer some protection from the wind and wet. They may also climb under the hoods or chassis of parked cars, attracted by the warmth, so please, make plenty of noise, smack the hood to give notice and allow a little lag time for them to escape before starting the ignition, and call 911 if a cat is stuck in your engine or between the radiator and fan, to get the panicked cat safely, humanely and quickly extracted by professionals without injury to anyone. Please especially beware of antifreeze drippings, which taste sweet and attract cats and dogs but are deadly poisonous and kill many pets every winter. My feral cat colony has several built shelters as well as a berm-like grassy roadside which slopes up toward the highway and is a preferred spot for leaning against because it blocks some of the cold wind\u2019s gusts. It is still bitterly cold and harsh everywhere though, and the shelters tend to be invaded by cold http://raccoons.it can be a a problem and a dilemma. At your house it is very easy and very compassionate to just put several cardboard boxes (much less scary than cat carriers) containing old rags or towels or linens on your porch where stray cats can find them and curl up, insulated and out of the worst of it. I recommend to leave the box positioned with the opening at the top and with the sides vertical as barriers. Typically cats in such boxes will not foul the insulating linens or create any smell problem because it is more pleasant for them to have a nice clean bed too and everyone cold and too preoccupied with getting warm to bother about fighting. Cats have been known to share a box and body heat even if they are not friends. Kittens \u2014 please always bring them all inside along with their mother. It is too great a burden for the mother to keep herself lactating and her litter warm enough for everyone to stay alive in frigid weather. She may run. A simple quiet bed in a closet, mud room or spare bathroom is a huge improvement. Fortunately this issue does not affect kittens born in the Spring so much, but those born in Fall kitten season are not prepared for it and suffer the consequences, sadly. Winter is also not the time to shave even seriously matted long-haired cats. Please consult your vet before you go removing fur. Please do whatever you can to help keep everyone who comes to you for mercy warm. Both I and my cats are fortunate not to have to contend with snow (I have never seen it), but it still gets down into the 20\u2032s, and no one down here, human or feline, ever knows how to act when that happens.",

You need to watch your cat carefully for signs if a cat is feeling too cold. \u201cAccording to PetMD, a cat\u2019s normal body temperature falls between 99.5\u00b0 and 102.5\u00b0 Fahrenheit. If his temperature dips below 99\u00b0, your cat is at risk of mild hypothermia.\u201dIs My Cat Cold? How to Keep a Cat Warm in Winter I have copied the following from Rover.com: Book Dog Boarding, Dog Walking and More as it explains what symptoms a person should watch for much better than I ever could. \u201cSince cats tend to hide their discomfort, you\u2019ll need to be extra observant to detect these subtle signs that your cat is cold. 1. Cold extremities: Your cat\u2019s ears, paws, and the tip of his tail will lose heat first. If these body parts feel cold, your cat is probably uncomfortably chilly. 2. Snoozing on direct heat sources: If you catch your cat routinely heading to the radiator for his midday siesta, you can bet he\u2019s trying to boost his body temperature. 3. Curling into a ball: While this could just be one of your cat\u2019s go-to sleeping positions, sometimes it\u2019s a clue that he\u2019s too cold. A cold cat will tuck his paws and tail beneath his body to preserve heat 4. Always wants to cuddle: If your cat is permanently fixed to your lap, it\u2019s fair to say he\u2019s trying to get warm. Chilly kitties will huddle together for warmth. If your cat\u2019s body temperature dips below 90\u00b0F, they are at moderate risk of hypothermia. PetMD lays out the following signs of mild to severe hypothermia in cats. Signs of mild hypothermia (body temperature of 90-99\u00b0F) in cats include:WeaknessShiveringLack of mental alertnessSigns of moderate hypothermia (82-90\u00b0F) include:Muscle stiffnessLow blood pressureUnresponsive, stupor-like stateSlow, shallow breathingSigns of severe hypothermia (less than 82\u00b0 F) include:Fixed and dilated pupilsInaudible heartbeatDifficulty breathingAny of these symptoms warrant a trip to the vet for immediate treatment.\u201d Is My Cat Cold? How to Keep a Cat Warm in Winter What should you do if your cat feels it is cold? Some suggestions are to get a blanket for her to lie on, or even cover part of her body, get her a heated bed, provide a bed that the cat can enter as a \u201ccave\u201d to trap her body heat in, reposition the cat\u2019s bed to a higher but stable location, put a pet coat on her to trap air and improve insulation, take advantage of the day\u2019s sunshine, play with the cat (increase circulation and build body heat), provide extra food, and/or allow your cat to share your bed at night to take advantage of your body heat.

Our digestive system takes the highest priority in where energy is allocated. Our brain prefers to be fed so that it can maintain healthy bodily function. So if you're in the process of digestion and choose to get into a pool, trying to subvert the hierarchy of our systems, it's likely your legs will cramp and you will die. We're not aquatic animals. Our bodies don't suddenly prioritize exercise just because you're swimming. If you go to the gym and workout shortly after eating you're probably not in danger of drowning. If you're just lifting weights, you might not even require enough energy to disrupt the digestive process. If you get on a treadmill and run, you might throw up to interrupt digestion. After a workout when your body is in repair mode, given the priority placed on digestion, it's good to consume the things your body needs to facilitate that repair; protein for your muscles and carbohydrates for energy.",

This allows your body to digest the food and reduces the risk of experiencing discomfort, cramping or digestive issues during your workout. Light Snack 30 Minutes to 1 Hour: If you have had a light meal or a small snack, you can start exercising within 30 minutes to an hour. A small snack like a banana or yogurt can provide some quick energy without causing discomfort during exercise. Pre-Exercise Nutrition: Ideally, you should have a balanced meal containing carbohydrates, protein and a small amount of healthy fats 2-3 hours before a more intense workout. This provides your body with the necessary fuel and nutrients for optimal performance. Hydration: Regardless of when you eat, staying hydrated is crucial before, during and after exercise. Drink water regularly to prevent dehydration. Individual Tolerance: Everyone's tolerance for exercise after eating is different. Some people can exercise comfortably soon after eating, while others may need more time to digest. Pay attention to how your body feels and adjust your timing accordingly. Goals: Your exercise goals can also influence your timing. If you are doing a leisurely walk, light yoga or stretching, you may be able to exercise sooner after eating. However, for high-intensity workouts or endurance training, it is generally best to wait longer after eating. Thus, the timing of exercise after eating can vary based on individual factors, the type and size of the meal or snack, and the intensity of the exercise. It is essential to listen to your body and find a time that works best for you to ensure a comfortable and effective workout.",

The shortest period I\u2019ve waited after a meal was about just over an hour. My lunch was just barely settled sufficiently and I only got a light workout at the gym that day. The issue with exercising after eating is that it interferes with digestion. Your stomach is trying to mash up the food and injecting digestive juices to retrieve the nutrients in your food. Blood flow gets directed to the capillaries lining the stomach wall to retrieve these nutrients. When you exercise, blood gets directed to your muscles, slowing down the digestion process. This could cause indigestion, and stomach discomfort. Also, the feeling of a full stomach jiggling while you run is most uncomfortable. In summary, ideally 3\u20134 hours after an average lunch sized meal. You could cut back the timing if you had a lighter meal, or do a lighter workout instead.",

Chewing Gum is a composite of Gum base that is formed from natural Resin. Resin provides a cohesive strength to Chewing Gum. Gum Base is the water-insoluble, non-nutritive, non-digestible masticatory (process of crushing) system used to carry substances in Chewing Gum like flavours, sweeteners. Gum Base includes Latex (natural rubber), Beeswax, Jelutong, Chicle (natural gum), Rosin (solid form of resins), Plasticizer (makes gum flexible), Talc, and Antioxidants.

            "Although chewing gum is designed to be chewed and not swallowed, it generally isn't harmful if swallowed. Folklore suggests that swallowed gum sits in your stomach for seven years before it can be digested. But this isn't true. If you swallow gum, it's true that your body can't digest it. But the gum doesn't stay in your stomach. It moves relatively intact through your digestive system and is excreted in your stool.",
            "You may not chew your food probably because it is a habit you have grown up with. When you were a kid, your momma used to tell you to finish up what was in your plate quickly so as to catch the school bus, classes, church etc. Other reasons as to why or circumstances under which you may not chew properly include; When you are in hurry. When you are watching participating in other activities while eating. Such activities include Watching TV, driving, operating machinery etc. Speed eating or competitive eating, a sport in which participants compete against each other to eat large quantities of foodContinue ReadingYou may not chew your food probably because it is a habit you have grown up with. When you were a kid, your momma used to tell you to finish up what was in your plate quickly so as to catch the school bus, classes, church etc. Other reasons as to why or circumstances under which you may not chew properly include; When you are in hurry. When you are watching participating in other activities while eating. Such activities include Watching TV, driving, operating machinery etc. Speed eating or competitive eating, a sport in which participants compete against each other to eat large quantities of food in a short duration of time. 1. Not chewing food properly prevents you from enjoying your meals . Everyone is entitled to enjoyment. Enjoyment is fun, it is pleasure and it is satisfaction. I bet you would not wish to miss it out all these. Put in other words, rushing through your meal with hardly any chewing, will not provide you an opportunity to taste or enjoy the meal. When you set time for your meals, concentrate, and chew properly, it forces you to slow down, savor each morsel and really enjoy all the flavors your meal has to offer. 2. Another disadvantage or improper chewing of food is that it can lead to a condition known as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). GERD is a condition in which the stomach contents (food or liquid) leak backwards from the stomach into the tube from the mouth to the stomach (esophagus). This action can irritate the esophagus, causing heartburn and other symptoms. The condition can also damage the lining of the throat and esophagus. According to studies, about 44% of Americans experience reflux or heartburn at least once a month, 20% have it every week and 7% suffer from it daily. 3. Not chewing food enough can result to insufficient nutrients for your body. Improper chewing means no breakdown of large food particles into smaller particles that are easier to digest. In addition makes it harder for your intestines to absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food particles as they pass through. Improperly digested food, which can cause a variety of adverse effects to your health, may also enter into your blood. So, never under estimate the importance of chewing. 4. It can lead to increased risk of bacterial overgrowth : Improper chewing creates room for large food particles which cannot be easily and fully digested by your stomach. Therefore some food will be left partially unprocessed. This undigested food causes an increase in bacteria in the colon, which may cause a variety of symptoms including, gas and bloating , diarrhea or constipation, abdominal pain and cramping etc. 5. Yet another reason, not chewing food enough leads overeating. It can be hard to maintain a healthy weight if you are hardly taking your time to chew food thoroughly. 6. It increases the risk of food poisoning . Without mastication, food won\u2019t have enough exposure saliva. Why is exposure to saliva important? The saliva contains an enzyme (lysozyme) which is useful at destroying food-borne pathogens that can cause serious illness and even death. The more you masticate, the more you expose food to the anti-bacterial enzyme 7. This practice can encourage poor oral health . By not chewing your food thoroughly, the bones holding your teeth will miss workout and hence become weak and unhealthy. In addition there will be increase plaque buildup tooth decay since you not chewing properly won\u2019t produce enough saliva that can clear food particles and bacteria out of the mouth. 8.Finally, not chewing food enough can result to incomplete digestion. When you do not chew properly, probably you are not signaling the chemicals in the mouth, or stomach to go and finish the digestion properly without some distress. This lead to development of ulcers, gas and bloating, diarrhea or constipation, abdominal pain and cramping can develop.",

If you've managed to get this far in life without swallowing a piece of gum, you may ask yourself: How much of the fear is based in urban legend and how much is fact? The Institute of Human Anatomy recently investigated the old wives' tale in a video shared by Nerdist. According to the educational channel, it isn't a myth that gum is indigestible. Beneath the dyes and flavorings is something called gum base, which is an umbrella term for ingredients like elastomers, waxes, resins, and fillers. These substances are what give gum its rubbery, endlessly chewable consistency. The mechanisms of digestion in your mouth\u2014a.k.a. your teeth and saliva\u2014can't break down the gum base, and neither can the rest of your digestive tract. Even when subjected to corrosive fluids like hydrochloric acid (stomach acid), pancreatic enzymes, and bile, the gum base won't disintegrate. So if you've ever pictured a wad of chewed-up, pink gum bubblegum sitting in your stomach after being swallowed, that image isn't far from the truth. The good news is that the legitimacy of the legend ends there. While it is true that gum doesn't get fully digested inside the human body, that doesn't mean it stays there forever. Humans have evolved to process all kinds of indigestible materials, such as fiber. If an item doesn't break down in one part of the digestive system, the body simply moves it along the tract until it's passed out. That means if you swallow your gum, it won't spend any longer inside your body than the indigestible portions of whatever else you ate that day. This only applies to accidental ingestion, and it's not an excuse to let your gum go down the hatch instead of spitting it out. As is the case with other indigestible materials\u2014like hair\u2014gum can clump together into a bezoar if consumed in large quantities. In that scenario, the myth of gum getting stuck inside you becomes closer to reality.",
