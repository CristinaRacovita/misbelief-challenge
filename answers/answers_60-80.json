            "knew a lot of this already because im obsessed but thank you so much for compiling it and adding a lot more background information that i wasnt aware of yet this mustve taken quite some time so big kudos to you as for some of your thoughtsquestions i doubt that cazador let astarion be a magistrate after turning him it would be pretty much impossible for him to work since it would be mostly during the day  and it would also grant astarion a sense a freedom and would make him feel like he actually worth something and degrading and making his spawn feel like they were worthless except for serving him seemed to be cazadors favorite pastime i dont think people know or realize he a vampire you can meet a girl in the sewer that wa excited to go to a party at cazadors place led there by a spawn i forgot who i dont know how perhaps magiccharms but people seem to be blissfully unaware of the red eye and fang in bg3  i mean tav pretty much look at astarion at first and he like seems like a perfectly normal elf no vampire haha i suppose cazador would be referred to a a lord since he been around for so long and seems to have at least some degree of power within the city i heard there wa a lot more content with him in the upper city but we all know what unfortunately happened to that i really do wish we would find out why he seemed particularly obsessed with astarion sure there this tidbit of astarion saying that cazador tortured him the most because his scream sounded the sweetest but im doubtful it that easy i think a lot of it had to do with how pretty astarion iswas and that he held a certain amount of power a a magistrate vampire in a lot of fiction dnd included iirc are attracted to power and are very vain strive for beauty and excess it could also just be that astarion seemed particularly bratty at first  disobeying cazador by letting that one man go that got him under the earth for a year for example then astarion slouching in front of cazador his foul mouth openly telling him something a crass a fuck you which i doubt wa the first time could be so many reason could also just be that astarions scream were the sweetest anyway thanks again for compiling this great work",
            "very interesting read thanks for compiling it all can you clarify on why gur hunted astarion before he even wa a vampire tho and who killed him gur or cazador by turning him into a vampire or he found him already dead and turned him astarion mention crawling out of his grave to cazador waiting for him id like to understand a bit more what happened then",
            "excellent point i forgot to add thank you he wa attacked by a gang of vagrant called the gur tribe which took personal offense to a ruling astarion made a magistrate they apparently beat him to death and cazador chased them off finding him bleeding to death on the street technically it wa cazador that killed him since he ha to drain astarion of his blood but the um coffin thing and digging out seems really pointless probably just to send a message",
            "most excellent work this write up thank you maybe you could add his last name i did not see it in your text it ancunin you can find it out if you decipher his tombstone",
            "excellent write up though i have yo ask wa gandrel not sent by his own people they wanted to know about the gur child that astarion took or am i misremembering i have vague recollection of the female gur leader telling u a much by the funeral pyre astarion could just be an unreliable narrator or i could be completely wrong",
            "no youre right  the gur want astarion because theyve heard that he free and want to see if he know anything about their child the old lady told me that when i finished killing cazador however astarion think they want him for cazador i havent let this happen but apparently if you let the gur take him you later find them all dead because cazador came for him",

            "the most common weapon throughout history all the way to the proliferation of gunpowder ha been the spear easier and cheaper to make the best choice for formation fighting which wa almost all fighting effective against cavalry etc the sword wa always a backup weapon and a symbol of rank the major exception is ancient rome with it iconic gladius but even they fielded plenty of spearwielding auxiliary as armor became heavier the weapon that rose to counter it were mace and club and eventually crossbow twohanded sword existed but were rare on the battlefield",
            "in fact the most common weapon on an ancient battlefield were spear the roman legion with the gladius were an exception to that still hastatii spear user were still a considerable part of the legion for a long time spears were much cheaper compared to a sword a spearpoint take up much le material and were simpeler to make resulting in le workhours than a sword for at least the celts sword were an elite weapon a very small amount of them owned a sword",
            "the thing is swords were probably used more in the late medieval era than in any era before it there are three reason for this swords were a lot cheaper and of better quality in the late medieval era than any era before it the medieval period saw massive improvement in all level of metal manufacture from efficient mining and deep mining technique to improved smelting the introduction of blast furnace which allowed for efficient smelting and reduced the impurity in the finished ironsteel and more mechanized and efficient smithing technique europe evolving several sword making center where sword were produced in vast quantity augsburg nuremberg milan innsbruck landshut basel etc so it went from a rich man weapon to every man weapon while the knight certainly became fully armored the same wasnt true for every soldier your average soldier might have had quality armor for his torso and head a helmet and a brigandine perhaps but the same wasnt true for his leg or arm swords definitely still had a function swords were a ever the easiest to carry sidearm its relatively lightweight and you can hang it from your belt in a relatively inexpensive scabbard thats minimally in the way so while your average soldier did have a pikepolearmcrossbowbowhe also had a sword in his belt and not just a dagger he probably did have a daggerknife a well though the name vary frequently meaning sword or dagger but theyre definitely sword of every length and shape the trend would continue through the renaissance era with everything from messers to katzbalgers to degen to spada da latos and all the way until the beginning of the 18th century with the introduction of the first reliable bayonet where the sword would become the weapon of officer and cavalry",
            "people mostly used spear pretty much everywhere and throughout history they are simple effective and cheap they also used projectile weapon a much a possible medieval armor progression after the 14th century wa largely driven by the development of gun plate armor is costly heavy and hard to maintain given it relative value against hand weapon",
            "yes there were sword on the battlefield but these were usually in the possession of men who had the money and training to use them nobleman influential person etc but all throughout history the most common weapon wa the spear it wa the common man weapon and i dont think it to far of a stretch to say that the spear is the deadliest weapon in history a firearm have only been the cornerstone of the army for the past 400500 year for more information i might suggest a youtuber called lindeybeige he ha alot of video on these type of subject and is a good source for more information",
            "i dont have to explain this because this is a common knowledge that a spiked weapon or a blunt force is better in dealing with an armored opponent well a bit arrogant and you did explain it and armour for general infrantry wasnt a developed a in medieval time general infantry  knight in heavy armour you are talking about there were load of archer and crossbowmen who had a much or even le armor than roman soldier so the armor is not that much better and many of those crossbowmen used shield a well called pavis so i perceive that in classical and early medieval period wed see infrantry with simple one handed sword much more often on the battlefield depends in hellenic culture thered be a lot more spear with sword only a backup weapon however i know that a armour grew even stronger and there wa no need for a shield for a knight yes lighter troop still used them",
            "from what i learned spear were just better overall than sword one on one versus cavalry and with a shield wall the extra range and far cheaper cost a it mostly wood meant you could mass spear far faster also with le trained people you could do far better the phalanx and other better trained formation were also stronger than sword version in a straight up fight so perhaps it wasnt improved technology that wa the biggest reason but more that we tend to overhype sword in medium film etc real combat wa far faster and more brutal and range wa everything get a few extra step with a spear and nine time out of ten you stab them in the face the really heavily armoured people you refer to would mainly be knight and their number would be very few yes sword were quite ineffective there counter would be using speed and your limited arrow on them a theyre slow either way the perceived decline of the sword is likely in part a medium thing overhyping sword in the first place and an archeological thing the fast and brutal reality of combat doesnt create much drama so extended sword fight are more camera worthy and for archeology spear wouldnt survive well compared to solid sword so sword appear in the dig site more frequently in reality sword were never a common a we now think  spear were far better in most circumstance and if you could fire a bow even better the more range you have the more likely you were to win usually",
            "youve got a couple of misconception here a the armour technology grew sword werent that useful on the battlefield this simply isnt true the sword wa still being used commonly by cavalry in the 18th 19th and even early 20th century that far the spear on the other hand wa eventually replaced by bayonet and musket that isnt to say that one is more useful than the other it simply to prove the point that the sword wa pretty much always useful because even if armor technology got better not everyone could afford it and even if they could they became le and le likely to wear it a it got heavier and heavier even at the sweet spot of armored personal warfare in europe probably the 15th and 16th century where munition grade plate armor like halfplate harness were common even among ordinary soldier such common armor would leave large portion of the body uncovered and vulnerable to a sword strike so a simple 1handed sword might be better a a selfdefense weapon or a status symbol of wealth and power also used for dueling the sword certainly wa those thing throughout history but it wasnt necessarily just those thing and it definitely wasnt all of those thing all the time you specified medieval europe in your title so consider the viking age sword it a broad heavy chopper it ha very little hand protection these are not ideal trait if all you want is a dueling weapon or a status weapon those are trait for a war weapon a socalled viking sword many of what we call viking sword were in fact forged in francia is heavy and broad because it intended to be used with a shield in war the idea of a one handed sword a primarily a selfdefense status symbol doesnt really become a thing until the renaissance but there were time where we see unit with short sword a lot because they often clashed in shield wall and needed a short precise weapon to stab enemy people in huge crowd of battling soldier again i refer you to the viking sword it is not a short sword it is a long one handed sword and it is very much not a precise stabbing weapon you are overestimating the number of armored warrior on the medieval battlefield especially in the viking age most combatant would be unarmored or armored only in padding and armour for general infrantry wasnt a developed a in medieval time it often covered few of the most endangered area but had a lot gap that could slashed so i think it wa a better tactic to deal a precise strike against these area instead of bashing the enemy armour im not really sure what youre trying to say here but i think youre saying that in the classical and early medieval period armor wa not well developed so sword were more common because the armor of the time could be exploited more easily and sword went away a armor improved armor of the classical and early medieval era was well developed youre not considering the whole soldier when you make statement like that consider the classical greek hoplite yes they hadnt discovered steel yet but he wa armored heavily in bronze and protected by a very large shield when the shield is up and youre fighting the the phalanx press your only available target on a hoplite would be to try and snipe his foot hard hit him in the thigh which he may have protected by either his shield or bronze thigh guard try to hit him in the head protected by the helmet obviously or to try and reach around his huge shield to try and get him in the neck or groin neither of which you get a real advantage from with a sword versus a spear in fact due to the spear length the spear get around the shield easier than a sword doe under some condition it doesnt get much better fighting an elite warrior of the early medieval era either like if you were in charles martels army or something in that case youd be covered from head to toe in iron so i perceive that in classical and early medieval period wed see infrantry with simple one handed sword much more often on the battlefield nope infantry primarily armed with sword are a rare thing in those time usually you get the spear and shield combo the only counterexample is the roman legionary and it arguable that the shield and pilum are the more important component to his weapon system than the gladius however i know that a armour grew even stronger and there wa no need for a shield a knight may wear a 2handed sword to battle but of course he could still pick another 2handed weapon to strike the enemy with true two handed sword are not knightly weapon they come later in the renaissance and are typically associated with mercenary and bodyguard longswords which are similar are but unless the knight is fighting a duel or attempting to take a town in escalade he is not going to pick a sword to try and fight armor it is true that two handed weapon became more popular a armor technology improved and yeah some of that wa that it wa easier to wound an armored man with a two handed weapon like a pollaxe but it wa actually mostly because the shield wa extraneous because the armor wa so good so why not carry a bigger weapon if youve got a free hand hopefully this ha been helpful if youre interested in listening to a droll englishman talk about topic like this check out matt easton i also recommend knyght errant if youre interested in learning in depth about plate armor how it developed it weakness it strength how to put the damn thing on etc",
            "the most common battlefield weapon pregunpowder were spear and other polearms like many people have already stated swords were a lot more used outside of the battlefield because of how much easier and practical to carry they were in comparison to a polearm which made them preferable much like a pistol would be preferable to a rifle to be carried around daily",

            "were they regarded a dangerous im not sure for most europeans unicorn were not considered they are not an expression of widespread folklore unicorns derive from medieval bestiary apparently from report of distant animal that may or may not reflect real creature numerous animal are credited with putting wind in the sail of report of unicorn and some people claim that the tooth of a narwhale wa put forward a a unicornrelated artifact but all that discussion wa contained largely within the court and the educated elite by whatever path the unicorn found it way into bestiary it failed to seep down to the folk it remained a matter of flawed natural history literature and famously tapestry and other form of art the unicorn did not normally appear in the folktale story told a fiction  the oral novel of the folk or in legend story generally told to be believed stith thompson in his mammoth motifindex of folk literature ha only two mention of the unicorn  lost in the great flood and a the companion of god thompson doe not provide source for these motif so they may have come from literature nevertheless the unicorn persisted a a motif in literature and became enormously powerful at that it wa characterized a rare and a a symbol of purity  only a virgin could attract a unicorn which wa compelled to kneel and place it horned head in her lap at that point hunter could kill the beast  so much for a happy ending the unicorn  a a fixture of literature ha managed to survive cultural transition nicely it ha remained a powerful symbol to the present it is one of the medievalesque motif common in fantasy literature that is not to be found in the writing of tolkien unless some tolkien expert can demonstrate that i am wrong  which i would welcome from renaissance to victorian art and writing the unicorn persisted not only in fantasy literature but a a motif in other form of literature and art again a an expression of the rare virtue of purity someone else may be able to handle the association of unicorn a a cutesy thing for little girl in the twentieth and twentyfirst century but i suppose it is not difficult to connect at least some dot for decade toy horse have long been marketed to girl popular culture characterizes girl a pure unicorn are a type of horse that are attracted to pure girl therefore girl should have unicorn i suppose it necessarily ha followed that the traditionally white unicorn white being an expression of it purity should become pink purple or with the color of the rainbow  thanks to modern marketing but again someone else may be able to handle this most modern chapter of the unicorn better than i edit there have been some interesting post about earlier reference to thing that are being referred to a unicorn we can contest the linguistics of what the various term meant most of which have not been presented here and we can question the intent of those term were these unicorn in the sense that is imagined today  and ha been a fixture of european literary culture since the middle ages thats hard to say also are these earlier term and reference linked to the creature in medieval bestiary some may have been and others may not have been but let concede that some or all are directly connected to our image of the unicorn the point i am making here is that by whatever path the unicorn found it way into bestiary it failed to seep down to the folk we tend to think of the unicorn a part of medieval folkloremyth but it apparently wa not it wa part of an intellectual literary process edit thanks for the heartwarming award",
            "unicorns actually predate the medieval bestiary by over a thousand year bestiaries a a genre dont exist until the 12th century but unicorn were recorded by pliny the elder in the first century in his historia naturalis book 8 ch 13 they are described a very difficult to catch even before that similar beast were described by ctesias strabo and others the physiologus a greek collection of christian animal lore originating 24th century but translated into latin 5th century and widely disseminated from there also contains the unicorn and this is the one we know and love reclusive attracted to virginal woman and also a metaphor for christ this is unsurprising because the unicorn wa present in a good number of early bibles including notably the latin vulgate several passage that are now translated often a wild ox or aurochs were at that time translated a unicorn being biblical and often reported by classical authority and natural historian unicorn were thought to be extant and in a sense they were considering how often they were conflated with rhinoceros monoceros onehorn is the greek word for the latinderived unicorn also onehorn the narwhal thing i have heard in layman speculation but ive never actually seen a classical or medieval text that make any connection between the two unicorns by and large were not very popular in the middle ages but they did receive a good amount of attention in heraldry the scottish ancestor of james i of englandjames iv of scotland took on the unicorn a part of their coat of arm when they married in a french noblewoman sometime in the 13th century i believe jumping ahead to the renaissance when james king of scotland became king of both scotland and england he used the unicorn alongside the traditional english lion in much of his heraldry a a way to represent the unity of both nation thus the unicorn became a national symbol of scotland including it national animal",
            "only a virgin could attract a unicorn which wa compelled to kneel and place it horned head in her lap so like am i off base in that appearing to be phallic imagery or am i the weird one",
            "i have a feeling that the dangerousness of the unicorn came from the coat of arm of scotland a the folklore around it always refers to the unicorn being the natural enemy of and in some case the only animal that can kill the lion ie england",
            "this is much later of course but in the grimm fairy tale a unicorn show up a a dangerous beast that is beaten when the hero stand in front of a tree make the unicorn charge at him then jump out of the way at the last moment so the unicorn get it horn stuck in a tree",
            "after reading your extremely interesting post i thought id try to tackle the transition from the unicorn of literary folklore to the unicorn a a girl toy i came across a 2008 master thesis by deirdre pontbriand called unicorncopia the unicorn a collected object which ill be using a the main source for this post before getting to the modern stuff though i wanted to point out a few interesting bit about the earlier period first off her long list of european monarch pope and other aristocrat from the middle ages onward mostly confirms what youve said here  that collecting unicorn horn item wa something that mainly concerned the elite they were often fashioned into jewelled cup or sword hilt the belief that their horn had medicinal property led to them becoming a symbol of apothecary in the 17th and 18th century its in this way that the idea of a unicorn wa perhaps most familiar to those who were le wealthy pontbriand writes the visual association of the unicorn with the medicinal field disseminated and intensified belief in the animal among a wider demographic namely those who were not wealthy enough to posse a tusk of their own or an object made from it this belief wa reinforced by the powder and shaving taken from the tusk and dispensed by apothecary in the hope of curing innumerable ill once dutch and danish trader established trade with the greenland inuit in the 17th century narwhal tusk became much more widely available and were sometimes sold a a cheaper alternative to unicorn horn because of the christian association with the unicorn narwhal horn masquerading a unicorn horn were also occasionally available to pilgrim a relic the french abbey of saintdenis while generally quite an elite institution wa also a pilgrimage destination one of the attraction there wa the sixandahalffoot unicorn horn pilgrims would drink the water the horn wa washed in hoping for cure since the unicorn wa so closely linked to christ also of interest with regard to the danger of the unicorn  the medieval physiologus described the unicorn a a strong and fierce animal that could only be tamed by the virgin i couldnt find an english translation to read on the fly here but i found various place online that summarize it that way a pontbriand doe in her thesis the taming of the unicorn wa symbolically relevant because the unicorn wa considered to be otherwise quite dangerous and hard to catch ok moving on to modern stuff the 19th century and early 20th century are when you really start to see the transition of the unicorn from high culture to popular culture the lion and unicorn who began a serious heraldic symbol began to populate childrens book illustration such a the 1937 rex the coronation lion comes to town or 1911s jack and jill in this early stage they were still representing the lion and the unicorn of heraldic art but in a way that wa made cute for child unicorns were similarly included in walt disneys 1940 fantasia these unicorn were small and cute like the one in childrens book in the 1940s you could still find work like tennessee williamss the glass menagerie which called on unicorn symbolism a something to do with christian feminity and innocence but increasingly they were becoming associated a cute animal for child after that medievalist fantasy became deeply intertwined with the 1960s counterculture tolkien for example wa initially hugely popular with hippy renaissance faires were place where member of the 60 counterculture could get together and share idea a major meeting ground for beatnik in 1960s san francisco wa a coffeehouse called the blue unicorn the medieval religious aspect of the unicorn started to be secularized in the fantasy and countercultural zeitgeist medieval art like the unicorn tapestries were major source of artistic inspiration for these early mixing of fantasy nerd and the hippie counterculture a lot of the modern association we have with the unicorn started with the publication in 1968 of the last unicorn by peter s beagle beagle wa inspired by the unicorn tapestries which had been on display in the cloisters museum in the met in new york city since 1937 other inspiration included story and art hed consumed about unicorn a a child such a the colt from moon mountain by dorothy lathrop after the last unicorn wa adapted into an animated feature film in 1982 the book popularity exploded unicorns here were linked with medievalist fantasy and that association would never go away things started to get really weird in the 1980s oberon zellravenheart and morning glory were a married couple of hippy active in the 1980s in 1984 zellravenheart patented an operating technique for turning an angora goat into a unicorn it wa pretty grisly involving taking out the goat horn and transplanting them in a way that made it look like one horn they were inspired to do this by seeing the unicorn tapestries in the cloisters zellravenheart and glory made nine of these unicorn goat and toured them around renaissance faires in the united states in the 1980s they dressed a a wizard and enchantress and did performance with the unicorn in 1985 they leased four of the goat to the ringling brothers who presented the living unicorn attraction with them facsimiles of the medieval unicorn tapestries featured in all of these stunt the performance were widely mocked but helped cement the idea of the unicorn a a tacky 80 fantasy creature heres a quote from critic scott cummings in 1985 imagine botticellis birth of venus converted with disneylike innocence into a las vegasstyle halftime extravangaza in honor of the male sexual organ and what do you get the brith of penis  celebrate the fantasy say the ringmaster where myth becomes reality  standing in the center of a giant cold clamshell is the living unicorn and by his side a stunning blonde dressed like glynda the good witch  it is not the long spiral spike horn to be seen in the unicorn in captivity tapestry at the cloisters it is a large dull goat horn set off by the beast long and bushy white coat  the spectacle climax in a frenzy of pageantry elephants with goldandsilversequined unicorn tapestry on their back and feathered showgirl astride their neck lumber around the track  pinkandpurple zebrastriped centaur dressed like roman centurions pull chariot as the music crescendo sparkling coil spiral up out of low ionic column around the arena butterflygirls with iridescent wing waft overhead and the living unicorn now standing on a round dais in the center of the center ring slowly rise 10 in the air throughout the unicorn stare out with blank goatish complacency occasionally reaching back to scratch his hindquarter oblivious to the lavish phallic ritual going on in honor of his zoological oddity the unicorn in the 1980s wa caught up in a perfect storm fantasy wa still considered very kitsch and a niche interest but one with a thriving if socially marginalized subculture unicorns were associated with child especially girl and with nerd by the 1980s much of the bite of the 1960s countercultural movement had worn off and thing which had once been rather subversive symbol could be more easily commercialized unicorn toy became ubiquitous in the 1980s most famous of these is the my little pony lineup which included unicorn as you say in your post the association between girl and horse made the unicorn a natural choice for people marketing girl toy in the late 20th century lisa frank is another famous example of 80 and 90 supersaturated girly unicorn in conclusion id say that there is a thread of continuity when it come to the association between girl and unicorn from the medieval to the modern early fantasy writer were very inspired by medieval art and so the link between woman and the unicorn survived but the change from the formidable medieval beast to the cutesy tacky toy is down to late 20th century consumerism linking unicorn with the uncool but very lucrative fantasy subculture and the misogynistically mockable category of thing girl like edit tagging op ujerswar",

            "yes the full moon produce a large amount of light making it possible to see outdoors quite easily without any aid this alone will account for more people out and about during the nighttime people will also be off of their normal sleep schedule if out during a full moon late at night the full moon ha actually been used throughout history an example would be a a harvest moon which would allow a great deal of time to harvest crop",
            "my father wa a police officer and he always said that people got crazy during the full moon there is no evidence for this being the case full moon are traditionally associated with temporal insomnia insanity hence the term lunacy and lunatic and various magical phenomenon such a lycanthropy psychologists however have found that there is no strong evidence for effect on human behavior around the time of a full moonthey find that study are generally not consistent with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect in one instance the 23 december 2000 issue of the british medical journal published two study on dog bite admission to hospital in england and australia the study of the bradford royal infirmary found that dog bite were twice a common during a full moon whereas the study conducted by the public hospital in australia found that they were le likely in this specific case i learned that it had more to do with the type of dog ie bite are reported more often by people bitten by large dog then bite from small dog this is because the damage done by large dog breed and be more severe simply by the nature of their k9s being larger this cause people to go into hospital for treatment where the bite is reported a small dog bite is le likely to cause a hospital visit and there for is le likely to be reported these study would have had to account for factor like these the ratio of small to large breed in the area however  theguesser10 is correct in suggesting that a full moon allows for longer period of activity at night especially in area or during period of history where electricity wa not available see also lunar effect in general apparent positive finding have tended to be inconclusive contradicted by other study or shown to be the result of statistical error metaanalysis of thirtyseven study that examined relationship between the moon four phase and human behavior revealed no significant correlation the author found that of twentythree study that had claimed to show correlation nearly half contained at least one statistical error",
            "he always said that people got crazy during the full moon confirmation bias",
            "short answer during full moon it would be about 8x brighter long answer the albedo of a body determines how much light it reflects for the moon that number is about 01 meaning that it reflects about 10 of the light this book ha a nice table of albedo for various building material including bright aluminum foil which it list an albedo of 08 or 80 therefore the moon now reflects 8x more light depending on the moon phase well receive variable amount of light on the earth for reference i want to show your some number for the luminous flux or lux or various light source although this sound like what a mad scientist might call his death ray i assure you this just mean how much light we get on a given area anyway cloudly moonless night 00001 lux full moon 02710 lux twilight 34 lux full moon with aluminum foil 2280 lux dim office building hallway 80 lux sunrisesunset 400 lux direct sunlight 32000100000 lux so youll easily be able to see at night provided there is moonlight since the full moon is now considerably brighter than twilight id suspect the sky would take on more of a navy blue color and that wed have fewer star visible in the night sky the milky way is already quite hard to see when there is moonlight and with a foiledmoon it will be a sight reserved for the few moonless night each month even the light from a crescent moon covered in aluminum foil is brighter than a full moon without one fun fact you can actually see the dark part of the crescent moon even without aluminum wrapping even though the dark part is not receiving direct sunlight it being illuminated by sunlight reflected from the earth in much the same way the earth get a little bit of light from the moon this is called earth shine and would be easily resolvable at night and it might even be possible to see it during the day",
            "i saw a video on youtube talking about this once they used the example of the moon being a giant disco ball according to the video we might rarely see a flash of light from the moon surface but only maybe a few time a month you can watch the video here",
            "my back of the envelope math say to try this experimentally would only take 115 year ignoring the pesky transport problem aluminium is 2720 kgm3 lets make that easier to read one metric tonne is 036764705882 m3 according to wikipedia household aluminium foil is 0016 mm 000016 m thick so let u divide by that to see how many square meter of foil we can make with a metric tonne that come out a 229779411762 m2 per metric tonne worldaluminiumorg state we produced 53057000 metric tonne of aluminium in 2014 so that would cover 121914062499 m2 spacecom say the moon ha a surface area of 38 million square kilometer 38107 km2  121914062499 m2  114835047657 so let say a nice 115 only a little longer than the pitch drop experiment editgrammar",
            "fun answer 247 disco party real answer the earth would not be lit 247 but star would be le visible at night if you live in an area with low light pollution you might lose a hobby but anyone who life in a city wont notice much difference"
