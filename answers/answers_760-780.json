            "So that we can scrunch our hands into a fist, or other complex shapes, without excessive stretching or leaving bags of loose skin \u2013 think about how much movement occurs when you're typing, holding a cup or doing chores. The lines are called 'palmar flexion creases' and develop before birth.",

            "The overall structure of the human palm is more or less the same for everyone; but, as we grow in the womb, minor unique features develop in the skin of (particularly) the gripping surfaces of our fingers and palm.

Anyway: the main creases in our palms follow the natural fold lines of the fleshy part of the palm as the \u201cfasciae\u201d grows and links the skin to the bones beneath, preventing the skin from coming away from the bones when the hand is flexed. There is apparently significant random variation in the insertion points of these structures, leading to variation in the depth and precise course of these creases. This, of course, ignores environmental impacts on our palms, such as use and damage. I am convinced that the areas of skin at the roots of my fingers are rather smooth because I developed thick callouses there as a young teenager as a result of manual work (mostly digging) and then lost a lot of skin there in my early twenties in a training accident involving a rope. Hence: we have lines in our palms which may easily be quite different between members of the same family - but there is no particular reason why. Certainly no deeper meaning than normal human variation in both development and lifestyle.",
            "There is no any need of any embarassment. The so many lines in your palm, tells that , you are an obsessive thinker. You think to the extent of over thinking.

It represents your intellect, thinking process, and communication skills. * Heart line: The heart line runs across the palm from the base of the pinky finger to the middle finger. It represents your emotions, relationships, and love life. * Fate line: The fate line is the shortest line on the palm and it runs across the palm from the wrist to the middle finger. It represents your career, life purpose, and destiny. In addition to these four main lines, there are also a number of other lines on the palm that can provide insights into your personality and life path. These lines include the sun line, the mercury line, the Apollo line, and the intuition line. The meaning of the lines on your palm can vary depending on their length, shape, and position. For example, a long and deep life line can indicate good health and longevity. A strong head line can indicate intelligence and good decision-making skills.

As i said that these lines give vital information about the stages of life, they also suggest the possible happenings if studied with perfection. You can pin-point the possible time and the type of happening by carefully calculating the position and shape of these four sectors. I remember citations made in Brigu Samhita regarding the vaastav parichay section. These four distinct sectors need to be first positioned according to vaastav gochan format and then the individual gon can help you to suggest the results. At the same time, it is imperative to maintain or observe the distance from mukta to keep track of the predicted date and happening. Again the cut at specific time and its developed vistaar has a lot of meaning while briefing about happenings.",

As she examined my palms, she grew quiet, and I could tell that something was amiss. \"You have a lot of lines on your palm,\" she said, her brow furrowed. \"More than most people. It's quite unusual.\" I didn't know what to make of this. I had always thought that having more lines on my palm was a good thing, indicating that I had a rich and complex destiny. But now I was starting to wonder if it meant something else entirely. The palm reader continued to study my hands, tracing the lines with her finger. \"These lines indicate a lot of stress and anxiety in your life,\" she said finally. \"You're someone who worries a lot and has a hard time relaxing.\" I felt a pang of recognition as she spoke. It was true that I tended to be a worrier, always fretting over small details and imagining worst-case scenarios. I had never really thought of this as a problem before, but now I could see how it might be holding me back. The palm reader went on to explain that having too many lines on my palm could be a sign that I was overthinking things and making my life more complicated than it needed to be. She suggested that I try to let go of some of my worries and focus on enjoying the present moment. As I left the palm reader's shop, I felt a sense of relief. While I couldn't change the number of lines on my palm, I could change the way I approached life. I resolved to take the palm reader's advice and try to live in the moment, instead of worrying about the future. Who knows? Maybe with a little less stress and anxiety, my lines would start to fade over time.",

Although many people think that practicing divination is harmless, the Bible shows that fortune-tellers and wicked spirits work together. For instance, Acts 16:16-18 mentions \u201ca demon of divination\u201d that enabled a girl to practice fortune-telling. But she lost this ability when the demon was cast out of her. Methods of Fortune-telling Fortune-telling, according to The Encyclopedia Americana, involves \u201cpredicting one\u2019s fortune or future, by alleged signs or indications seen and interpreted by amateur or professional diviners.\u201d Fortune-telling is, therefore, a form of divination, a procedure for gaining knowledge of the unknown or of the future by extraordinary means. That is why the names of many of its methods end in -mancy (from the Greek man\u00b7tei\u02b9a: \u201cthe mode of divination\u201d). There are, for example, cartomancy (fortune-telling by cards), chiromancy (by the lines of one\u2019s hand) and crystallomancy (by use of a crystal ball or other transparent object). Many methods of fortune-telling involve looking for and interpreting omens or signs that supposedly foreshadow future events. Astrology is in this category. The sun, moon, stars and planets are said to affect earthly and human events. Each star group and each planet is assumed to exert a particular influence, positive or negative. Astrologers cast a \u201choroscope\u201d or chart of the positions of the heavenly bodies relative to one another at the time of a person\u2019s birth. From this they claim to be able to read his personality and destiny. Palmistry is a way of fortune-telling by examining the lines and other characteristics of the palm of someone\u2019s hand. Showing a close connection with astrology, palmists speak of the hand as having \u201cmounts,\u201d named after the seven planets known to ancient astrologers.",

The life line on the palm is believed to indicate a person's vitality, health and overall well-being. Some palm readers interpret the life line as indicating the length of a person's life, while others see it as an indicator of the person's energy and vitality. It's not uncommon for the life line to have breaks or branches, and it's important to consider the shape and position of the line in relation to other lines on the palm. The meaning of the line might be different depending on the person who reads it. It's important to keep in mind that the interpretation of lines on the palm is highly subjective and varies depending on the reader. Even if the life line on your palm ends in two lines that turn away from each other, it doesn't necessarily have any specific meaning. Rather than trying to read into the lines of your palm, it would be more beneficial to focus on leading a healthy lifestyle, and taking care of your overall well-being."

However, these days things are very different. To start with Nickel\u2013iron and Lithium polymer are way less affected by your charging habits. On top of this charging is monitored by the charging circuitry in the device. When charging reaches 100% your phone simply turns off the charger and does not draw anymore power in. Yes, it may still physically be plugged in to the wall with the switch switch turned on but it is not charing at this point. At this point all the charging circuitry is doing is keeping the battery at 100%. If the above was not enough iPhones and probably other brands as well learn your charging habits and plan for your phone to be fully charged at a certain time. Say you wake up at 6am every morning to go to work your iPhone and probably others as well will slow the charger down so that it does not reach 100% before 6am and therefore does not sit on the charger at 100% for hours. Everything these days in monitored and looked after. There is no need to worry because you simply can\u2019t ruin your battery by leaving your phone plugged in. Some will say you should only charge to 80% but to be honest there is no harm in charing to 100%. So you can simply relax about the above. What you do need to do to get the best out of your battery is never let it fall below 20% before charging it and iPhones indicate this by the battery symbol turning red on the screen along with a message telling you it is time to put your phone on its charger. This is the end that is hard on your battery, letting it fall below 20% and use slow chargers not fast chargers. Yes, your phone maybe designed for a faster charger, so is mine but fast charging causes more heat and heat is very hard on batteries. Slow charing even if a battery is designed for fast charging is always much more kind on the battery. Do what I do. Plug your phone in overnight on a slow charger. Make sure it is not covered by anything like blankets etc and it can get ventilation so any heat can escape as one you don\u2019t want a fire and two you want your battery to last as long as it can. Take it off charge in the morning. As soon as my iPhone hits 20% on the charger it goes, I charge to 100% percent and I got six years out of my iPhone 6 Plus battery. So don\u2019t stress about overcharging because you simply can\u2019t. That is assuming your charger and the charging circuity is all working correctly of course.",

You have a good charger but you have no time to charge your mobile in your day to day schedule. Well the answer to both these cases is, all smartphones these days have a optimized circuit mechanism that cuts off the connection of phone\u2019s supply with the battery when the phone gets fully charged. So, this means once you see the battery level on your smartphone at 100 percent then it is no longer on the main power supply or in other words you smartphone is back on its battery strength. But, we have an exception here, As the phone starts running on it\u2019s own fully charged battery, it consumes power. Even if you are on standby or active-standby mode, there will come a point in time when your battery decreases ro 99%. Now, according to basic rules a phones follows, it should allow the battery to charge if the battery is less than 100%. Hence, the phone starts charging again. So, this cycle of hopping between 99% and 100% creates a problem for your smartphone. Please note that it is not 99% percent for all the smartphones, some smartphones start charging only when the battery reaches to a level of 90% and this figure varies for different devices but the differences in these figures are not huge. Some tips to maintain healthy battery life are:Never use your device while it is charging. You must have observed that while doing so your smartphone heats up which hampers the battery life.Never put your smartphone under direct sunlight (again because of temperature issues).Hope I answered your query.",

If you're in a rocket that stands still here on Earth you experience a force of gravity. If you fly in this rocket far away from Earth but your engines provide thrust and accelerate the rocket at 9.8 m/s^2, you'll feel basically the same. So Einstein identified these two cases as being the same, in some sense. Now imagine when you fly in this rocket some light enters a window on your left, at exactly right angle to your rocket. Light is moving with limited speed and reaches your right window a bit later, when the rocket moved a bit forward. Because the rocket moved, light crosses right window not directly opposite of where it came in, but a bit farther from rocket's nose. So it appears to be travelling not a direct line inside the rocket but a curved one. If this situation is no different (as Einstein guessed) from a case where the rocket just sits still on Earth surface, in Earth's gravitational field, the same must happen with light in this case too: in presence of gravity it must follow curved line, not a straight one.",
            "Einstein got this idea from equivalence principle. He assumed an elevator moving in space at an acceleration equal to gravity of earth, and observed that there will be no difference between the elevator moving in outer space (where there is no gravity) with an acceleration equal to gravity of earth, and another elevator standing on earth as the persons in both elevators will feel same weight.Now, in the elevator moving in space, if a light beam is thrown from one wall of the elevator in a horizontal direction towards another wall, the beam will not reach exactly opposite point on the other waContinue ReadingEinstein got this idea from equivalence principle. He assumed an elevator moving in space at an acceleration equal to gravity of earth, and observed that there will be no difference between the elevator moving in outer space (where there is no gravity) with an acceleration equal to gravity of earth, and another elevator standing on earth as the persons in both elevators will feel same weight.Now, in the elevator moving in space, if a light beam is thrown from one wall of the elevator in a horizontal direction towards another wall, the beam will not reach exactly opposite point on the other wall because the elevator would have moved up in the time the light beam would travel the width of elevator. Light beam will hit on the opposite wall at a slightly lower height than the height from which the light beam was emitted. Thus the path of light will be curved.Situation in the elevator on earth being exactly equivalent, light path should bend in the stationary elevator also. Thus gravity should be bending the path of light. As we know light travels straight in space, so the space itself should be bending. This way Einstein reached a conclusion that space is curved in the vicinity of gravity.",

The maths might look a little scary, but I walk through it as slowly as possible. I think it is worthwhile to try and follow it, if you can. If you don't care for the full derivation, and are willing to accept a given equation at face value, then you can skip the first two sections and rejoin later: there's a big note in bold telling you when to rejoin!We will be working in the Schwarzschild metric; the solution for a spherically symmetric mass distribution, with no charge and no angular momentum. The interval (the distance through spacetime) under a general metric g\u03bc\u03bdg\u03bc\u03bd is defined as: ds2=\u2212c2d\u03c42=g\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bcdx\u03bdds2=\u2212c2d\u03c42=g\u03bc\u03bddx\u03bcdx\u03bd For the Schwarzschild solution for g\u03bc\u03bdg\u03bc\u03bd, this gives[1]: ds2=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)dt2+dr2(1\u2212Rsr)+r2d\u03b82+r2sin2(\u03b8)d\u03d52ds2=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)dt2+dr2(1\u2212Rsr)+r2d\u03b82+r2sin2\u2061(\u03b8)d\u03d52 Where we have used spherical polar coordinates, and Rs=2GMc2Rs=2GMc2 to save time writing! We would now like to find the General Relativity form of the equations of motion \u2014 the geodesic equations. The geodesic equations can be calculated in two ways: you can use the metric to calculate the metric connection \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u0393\u03b2\u03b3\u03b1, and then sum; or you can extremise the interval. The equivalence of these two methods shows that geodesics are the shortest distance between two points in spacetime. They are the \u201cstraight lines\u201d in a curved spacetime. To extremise a functional L(x0,x\u02d90....xn,x\u02d9n)L(x0,x\u02d90....xn,x\u02d9n), we use the Euler-Lagrange equations[2] : \u2202\u2202p(\u2202L\u2202x\u02d9\u03bc)\u2212\u2202L\u2202x\u03bc=0\u2202\u2202p(\u2202L\u2202x\u02d9\u03bc)\u2212\u2202L\u2202x\u03bc=0 Where (x0,x1,x2,x3)=(ct,r,\u03b8,\u03d5)(x0,x1,x2,x3)=(ct,r,\u03b8,\u03d5), and the dot, x\u02d9x\u02d9, indicates the derivative with respect to the affine parameter pp , such that x\u02d9=dxdpx\u02d9=dxdp. We could just let p=\u03c4p=\u03c4, the proper time. But eh, leave it general for now! We can construct our \u2018Lagrangian\u2019 (the spacetime interval) for this system: L=(dsdp)2=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d92+r\u02d92(1\u2212Rsr)+r2\u03b8\u02d92+r2sin2(\u03b8)\u03d5\u02d92L=(dsdp)2=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d92+r\u02d92(1\u2212Rsr)+r2\u03b8\u02d92+r2sin2\u2061(\u03b8)\u03d5\u02d92 Now, the standard procedure is to plug this into the EL equation four times, for each coordinate. However, we can simplify things by noting that:\u03b8=constant=\u03c02\u03b8=constant=\u03c02 is always a solution (plug in \u03bc=2\u03bc=2 to check, but it is true)Nothing is dependent on tt or \u03d5\u03d5, except the coordinates themselves.We can therefore use the first point to simplify our Lagrangian: L=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d92+r\u02d92(1\u2212Rsr)+r2\u03d5\u02d92L=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d92+r\u02d92(1\u2212Rsr)+r2\u03d5\u02d92 If we plug in LL to the EL equations for \u03bc=0\u03bc=0 and 33, we get the following, since nothing depends on \u03b8\u03b8 or tt, so the second element of the EL equation must be zero! \u03bc=0:\u2202\u2202p(\u22122c2(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d9)\u22120=0\u03bc=0:\u2202\u2202p(\u22122c2(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d9)\u22120=0 \u03bc=3:\u2202\u2202p(r2\u03d5\u02d9)\u22120=0\u03bc=3:\u2202\u2202p(r2\u03d5\u02d9)\u22120=0 If the derivative of a function is zero, then that function is a constant! We therefore have two very important equations: (1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d9=k(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d9=k And: r2\u03d5\u02d9=hr2\u03d5\u02d9=h Where kk and hh are constants. Though it's not entirely obvious without further analysis, this is a statement of conservation of energy (the first eqn.), and conservation of angular momentum (the second eqn.)Now, we could now plug in \u03bc=1\u03bc=1, and differentiate with respect to rr and r\u02d9r\u02d9. It\u2019s a lot of pretty tedious algebra! You get a correct expression at the end of it, in terms of r\u00a8r\u00a8, which you then need to be able to integrate \u2014 ew. Luckily, it turns out that there is a much easier way to get an expression for r\u02d9r\u02d9. Recall the Lagrangian: L=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d92+r\u02d92(1\u2212Rsr)+r2\u03d5\u02d92L=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)t\u02d92+r\u02d92(1\u2212Rsr)+r2\u03d5\u02d92 Now just insert our expressions for t\u02d9t\u02d9 and \u03d5\u02d9\u03d5\u02d9! L=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)(k1\u2212Rsr)2+r\u02d92(1\u2212Rsr)+r2(hr2)2L=\u2212c2(1\u2212Rsr)(k1\u2212Rsr)2+r\u02d92(1\u2212Rsr)+r2(hr2)2 Which simplifies to: L=\u2212c2k21\u2212Rsr+r\u02d921\u2212Rsr+h2r2L=\u2212c2k21\u2212Rsr+r\u02d921\u2212Rsr+h2r2 This Equation is valid for both photons and for massive particles \u2014 this has been a totally generic statement about the geometry of spacetime. Since we'd like to examine specifically photons, we recall the property of a null geodesic is[3] : ds2=0ds2=0 But we defined LL as being L=(dsdp)2L=(dsdp)2. If ds=0ds=0, then we must have: Lphoton=0Lphoton=0 If we used a massive particle, we could set p=\u03c4p=\u03c4, to find: Lparticle=\u2212c2Lparticle=\u2212c2 We want the photon form, so we get: \u2212c2k21\u2212Rsr+r\u02d921\u2212Rsr+h2r2=0\u2212c2k21\u2212Rsr+r\u02d921\u2212Rsr+h2r2=0 Multiply by that denominator, to get: \u2212c2k2+r\u02d92+h2r2(1\u2212Rsr)=0\u2212c2k2+r\u02d92+h2r2(1\u2212Rsr)=0 So: (drd\u03c4)2=c2k2\u2212h2r2(1\u2212Rsr)(drd\u03c4)2=c2k2\u2212h2r2(1\u2212Rsr) For convenience, we now do a number of changes to r\u02d9.r\u02d9. Firstly, we decide we care more about how rr changes with \u03d5\u03d5, than about how it changes with \u03c4\u03c4: drd\u03c4=drd\u03d5d\u03d5d\u03c4=drd\u03d5\u03d5\u02d9=hr2drd\u03d5drd\u03c4=drd\u03d5d\u03d5d\u03c4=drd\u03d5\u03d5\u02d9=hr2drd\u03d5 The next step is not obvious, but it simplifies the mathematics! We remember that in Newtonian mechanics, it was quite often easier to talk about changes in 1r1r, than in rr, we therefore hope this is true here (spoilers \u2014 it is!). We let u=1ru=1r Therefore: drd\u03d5=dud\u03d5drdu=\u2212r2dud\u03d5drd\u03d5=dud\u03d5drdu=\u2212r2dud\u03d5 Where I assumed that you can differentiate 1r1r , so I skipped that step! We therefore have: drd\u03c4=hr2(\u2212r2dud\u03d5)=\u2212hdud\u03d5drd\u03c4=hr2(\u2212r2dud\u03d5)=\u2212hdud\u03d5 Therefore, plugging in to our equation, and changing from rr to uu, we get: h2(dud\u03d5)2=c2k2\u2212h2u2(1\u2212Rsu)h2(dud\u03d5)2=c2k2\u2212h2u2(1\u2212Rsu) So: (dud\u03d5)2=c2k2h2\u2212u2+Rsu3(dud\u03d5)2=c2k2h2\u2212u2+Rsu3 Now \u2014 another trick which isn't intuitively obvious (much like the shift to uu), we take the derivative with respect to \u03d5\u03d5: 2dud\u03d5d2ud\u03d52=0\u22122udud\u03d5+3Rsu2dud\u03d52dud\u03d5d2ud\u03d52=0\u22122udud\u03d5+3Rsu2dud\u03d5 We can divide by dud\u03d5dud\u03d5 (strictly speaking you'd need to ensure you included u=constu=const as a solution, but it is actually already also contained in the rest of the equation, so we can forget about it!) d2ud\u03d52=\u2212u+3Rs2u2d2ud\u03d52=\u2212u+3Rs2u2 This is our equation! This is what we've been after all of this time! (REJOIN HERE IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE DERIVATION) If we rejig it a little bit, and write out RsRs, you get: d2ud\u03d52+u=3GMc2u2d2ud\u03d52+u=3GMc2u2 With u=1ru=1r.It is at this point that we note that the left hand side of this equation is merely Newtonian mechanics. If we were to repeat this process in Newtonian mechanics, we would expect the equation for light to be: d2ud\u03d52+u=0d2ud\u03d52+u=0 That is because it solves to give: u=Acos(\u03d5+\u03b80)u=Acos\u2061(\u03d5+\u03b80) Which means: r=bsin\u03d5r=bsin\u2061\u03d5 This is the equation of a straight line in polar coordinates, with closest approach bb.This is the statement that light moves in straight lines.However in general relativity, we have that extra term on the right \u2014 3GMc2u23GMc2u2 \u2014 which is only zero when there is no mass! Now \u2014 cc is big, and generally MM is fairly small (by GR standards), so quite often we can approximate it as zero \u2014 which explains why Newtonian physics was thought to be correct for so long! We suppose we are in the limit that this term is fairly small, so the path of light is almost straight. We can then guess that: u=ustraight+\u0394ucurvedu=ustraight+\u0394ucurved u=sin\u03d5b+\u0394uu=sin\u2061\u03d5b+\u0394u We can then plug this guess back into our equation, to find out what \u0394u\u0394u is. d2(ustraight+\u0394u)d\u03d52+ustraight+\u0394u=3GMc2(ustraight+\u0394u)2d2(ustraight+\u0394u)d\u03d52+ustraight+\u0394u=3GMc2(ustraight+\u0394u)2 We recall that: d2ustraightd\u03d52+ustraight=0d2ustraightd\u03d52+ustraight=0 So we can throw those terms away. We also approximate that \u0394u\u0394u is small compared to uu, so that: (ustraight+\u0394u)2\u2248u2straight(ustraight+\u0394u)2\u2248ustraight2 Therefore, we are left with: d2\u0394ud\u03d52+\u0394u=3GMc2b2sin2\u03d5d2\u0394ud\u03d52+\u0394u=3GMc2b2sin2\u2061\u03d5 This isn't particularly pleasant to solve \u2014 but there are several ways to simplify it. For now, we can just write down that the answer is: \u0394u=3GM2c2b2(1+13cos(2\u03d5))\u0394u=3GM2c2b2(1+13cos\u2061(2\u03d5)) Therefore, we have found that \u2014 for small MM, the path taken through space by a photon is given by: u=sin\u03d5b+3GMc2b2(1+13cos(2\u03d5))u=sin\u2061\u03d5b+3GMc2b2(1+13cos\u2061(2\u03d5)) Or: r=1sin\u03d5b+3GMc2b2(1+13cos(2\u03d5))r=1sin\u2061\u03d5b+3GMc2b2(1+13cos\u2061(2\u03d5)) This is no longer a straight lineAs you can see \u2014 the inclusion of the GR term in the right hand side introduces non-straight-line solutions! The total angular deflection\u200b of the light as it passes this mass can be found by comparing the limits as r\u2192\u221er\u2192\u221e. In this limit: \u0394\u03d5=4GMc2b\u0394\u03d5=4GMc2b This is the total deflection of light, as it passes a (non-rotating) body of mass MM, with a closest approach distance of bb.If you calculate this value for light passing as close as possible to our sun (b=Rsunb=Rsun), then you calculate a deflection of \u0394\u03d5=1.75arcseconds\u0394\u03d5=1.75arcseconds[4] In 1919, Arthur Eddington used a solar eclipse to measure the deflection of light from stars of known position[5]. He calculated that the light which passed the surface of the sun had a deflection of: \u0394\u03d5=1.98\u2032\u2032\u00b10.3\u2032\u2032\u0394\u03d5=1.98\u2033\u00b10.3\u2033 Or using a different method: \u0394\u03d5=1.61\u2032\u2032\u00b10.4\u2032\u2032\u0394\u03d5=1.61\u2033\u00b10.4\u2033 These results are both consistent with the predictions of general relativity. We therefore have confidence in the model of GR, which predicts that under some metrics, the path taken by light is not always straight. Here I have demonstrated the deflection of light by the Schwarzschild metric, and shown that light has a total angular deflection \u0394\u03d5=4GMc2b\u0394\u03d5=4GMc2b And this value was experimentally verified in 1919 \u2014and has been many times since then. It is this gravitational deflection which leads to gravitational lensing and the Einstein rings which you see in the other answers.I hope that was at least somewhat interesting \u2014 even if it was a deluge of mathematics.Footnotes[1] Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin[2] https://application.wiley-vch.de/books/sample/3527411887_c17.pdf[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.0109.pdf[4] https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/sun/indepth[5] http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roypta/220/571-581/291.full.pdf",

After 6 months, I'm just self obsessed and arrogant. :) Let me take you on a fun journey. I was the amazingly handsome guy in the middle. Weighing around 113 Kg.To be precise, my life comprised of a few things;Wake upEat shit foodGo to classes, go out, eat and waste time etc.SleepRepeat.I didn't care about myself. I was a lazy fat shit. I was destroying my life, my body and had become underconfident and didn't really prefer going out of my comfort zone. At this point of time, I had started believing that this is how I'm gonna live all my life, but there was this feeling which was nagging me, the worst feeling that you can probably ever get. The feeling of self loathing. And just one random day, I thought let's give it a try. I didn't have anything to lose anyway. So I searched a bit about fat loss on the internet and made this.A little plan. Not something tough. But what was difficult was following it everyday without any excuses. I still remember a guy came into my room and laughed at this and said it's no use doing this and I'll always be like this. After a little more time, I understood that mocking and discouragement was a part of this. Managing everything was very difficult. I couldn't divide my time properly and I missed deadlines. After around 2 months, there wasn't much difference in my body but I could see that I was more attentive, more active and a little more disciplined. Then came running. Which has become my absolute favourite right now. I ran in my campus. I used to go out of breath in around 500\u2013800 metres or so. Now I can run 10kms. Fast forward two more months. I started lifting. Ordered some dumbbell sets from Amazon. Started studying about fitness. Made notes. Started to count calories. I studied about a particular diet or a workout regime before implementing it on me. While buying stuff from market, I used to see the caloric contents rather than the price tag. And some people had started telling me that I looked a bit slim. It felt nice. I could see my muscles and biceps taking shape. It felt amazing and that I could also have a nice physique. And then I understood; that I can also look good. :p It had become my daily routine to workout and go for a run. There was no room for junk or sugary foods. I ate vegetables, eggs, paneer and oats and had regular protein shakes. I was strong. Like really strong. I extremely rarely skipped my workout or cheated on my diet. I had that discipline and I was proud of that. And still am. It was not easy. And after all this.I became this guy. It is good to live like this. People don't understand that they are destroying their lives by drinking, smoking all that. It's not cool. What's cool is to not indulge in that useless shit and live a healthy and a thriving life. Right now I stand at 6 ft and weigh around 85 kgs. Losing more than 25 kg was probably one of the toughest things in my life. But it changed me in a way I cannot imagine. There is no trace of underconfidence or self loathing left now. I understand discipline and know how to manage my time without disturbing other things. I can talk to a stranger for an hour without feeling weird or scared. It's fun to step outside now.This was me last week getting bored. So. I think I did ok. :P",

Maybe I\u2019m not tough. Maybe I\u2019m more like a cartoon of someone tough and unique or a character. I could not only be viewed as a cliche, I fit into an entire genre of similar, individualistic but acceptably normal characters who are practically caricatures: Kimmy Schmidt, Anne of Green Gables (the Canadian one), Daphne from Scooby Doo, Willow from Buffy before she got powerful, Lucy from I Love Lucy, Pippi Longstocking, Molly Ringwald from all of the Brat Pack movies other than The Breakfast Club. They are sometimes lovable, sometimes strong, sometimes somewhat complex, sometimes punchlines. I\u2019m an artist and I live in the epicenter of the Brooklyn part of New York and maybe the world embraced for its Hipster Culture inclusive of Brooklyn artists. I kind of love the things that lots of people who don\u2019t live here enjoy once those things are filtered down as mass produced kitsch to Urban Outfitters and Amazon and maybe Bed Bath and Beyond in plastic packaging, but I like the things here in thrift shops and hand made on walls. As originals. And so I may actually BE a hipster. And a snob. I am a Jewish girl living in the New York area who doesn\u2019t really identify with my religion, and says I\u2019m probably someplace between Agnostic and Jewish. But who observes most major Jewish holidays. To be fair, I also overdo all of the other holidays on the calendar including Christmas. So I\u2019m a cultural Jew. Kind of. Like lots of the rest of us in New York. Pass me a bagel! Except that due to my complicated medical issues, I watch my carb and sugar intake. So could you please hold the carbs and make that a low carb bagel if you have one? Or a cauliflower flour bagel? No jelly. Cream cheese is OK because it\u2019s not an aged cheese. No MSG. Organic because I avoid fake salts and sugars. Thanks! I swear this is a real thing and not just because I\u2019m a Millennial. Also I only drink water, so I don\u2019t need any of that tea, coffee, juice, or cocktail that you made. Want to go out? I live in New York and there\u2019s a ton to do. Did I already mention that I live in Brooklyn in New York City and that while there is a lot wrong here ( the subway is such a pain) there is also a lot to love ( good public transportation makes things so convenient. I know it\u2019s not perfect but I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to drive). Also you can find anything you want to do here, at any time of day or night. You just have to be able to afford to get in. New York is so expensive. There are lots of free and affordable and undergound events, you just have to know where to look. Did I already mention that I may be a hipster and a snob?\u2026 Luckily I\u2019m more than all of that\u2026 \u2026 unless thinking that is part of the cliche\u2026 Maybe none of this matters if not being afraid to be in some ways a cliche to some eyes and even to mine from some angles, informs who I am and supports other aspects, and is at all meaningful.Crayon self portrait (digitally altered from real crayon)",

Audrey Hepburn is to die for, and Stephen Sondheim is great. Sex in the City was fun and Streisand was killer\u2014you know, in the beginning, before she was devoured by her own ego. I gasp when I get excited and worry too much about how my body looks. I had a difficult relationship with my father and will automatically pit myself against any authority. Rebellion begins at home. Hierarchies irritate me, and I\u2019m contemptuous of awards. The academy awards are exempt because I\u2019m interested in what everyone is wearing. It\u2019s a gay guy thing. I\u2019m a depressive who thinks that Sylvia Plath was the most potent thing to come out of twenty century poetry. I was a Catcher In The Rye kid: I read it obsessively, carried it around everywhere, and petted it like a kitten kept hidden in my inside pocket. Alienated American kids of a certain generation did that. I am an outsider, one of millions. There are so many of us\u2014who\u2019s on the inside again? I no longer do drugs, but I can polish off twenty doughnuts and a gallon of milk in one sitting. I fixate on men, and spend a whole lot of time choking the chicken. Addicts are obsessive: in my first year drug free we used to spend all night in an infamous diner/dive, drinking coffee till we puked. Then we would wipe ourself off and drink more coffee. I love that about us, I don\u2019t know why.",
