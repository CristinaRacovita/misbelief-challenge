Hillary testified under oath for 11 hours before a Republican led committee. Trump has refused to testify under oath. Trump complained about Comey\u2019s investigation of his campaign. Comey also investigated Hillary, and even announced and updated the investigation several times during the campaign, which is highly irregular. ( Comey\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign was not revealed during the campaign although they both occurred at the same time. ) All of the investigations of Hillary (4 years, $100 million) and her campaign led to no charges. The Russia /Trump campaign investigation has run in one form or another since July 2016 (1 1/2 years) . It has resulted in charges or guilty pleas from 34 people so far. It is universally accepted that Russia was responsible for the theft and release of the emails (through Wikileaks ). Numerous Trump associates have pled guilty to lying under oath about their contacts with Russians during the period. The campaign chairman shared proprietary campaign information with a Russian with ties to Russian intelligence. Another Trump contact conversed with the hackers (Guccifer 2.0) and the outlet that released the hacked material. (Wikileaks) In conclusion, Hillary Clinton was attacked and investigated by the Republican dominated Congress for four years because she was the front runner for the Democratic nomination. Her husband\u2019s infidelities clearly added to her problems. The endless mud throwing, the release of the hacked emails, which created the Bernie Sanders rift in the party, and the release of details of the investigation of Hillary\u2019s emails ( but not the FBI investigation into the Trump Campaign) created an image that was not supported by evidence. Welcome to politics in the 21st century. (Remember that Barack Obama was accused of being a Muslim who was not born in America.",

She is coming across to me as pathologically dishonest. Not just ordinarily dishonest like a politician should be. Just turn off the sound on your TV, and you might see what I mean. They rehearse speech to the great degree; they don\u2019t pay nearly as much attention to rehearsing microexpressions, even if they could. I like her husband, but she is evil. Also, it\u2019s about the Democratic party as a whole. When I first came to the US, I was neutral. Then Monica Lewinsky scandal broke out, and that made me a committed democrat. That\u2019s because while I think Bill certainly deserved a slap on a wrist(*), the whole entrapment of Monica Lewinsky by Linda Tripp who baited her, played her like a fine instrument and then broke the story (**), the whole partisan hypocrisy of Republicans made me kind of hate them. So I\u2019ve been a democrat ever since because of Bill. And now I am no longer a democrat because of Hillary. Not necessarily a Republican, just not a Democrat. For one, unlike Trump, Hillary did not become a Presidential Candidate fairly or democratically, because of her conspiracy with her party. To vote for her, or for her party after that, would mean to accept the fact that the US democracy is dead. Two, why is she even calling herself a Democrat when she is conquering one Middle Eastern nation after another, and now acting up in Eastern Europe? They have not closed the prison in Guantanamo bay, like others have said. They have not pardoned Snowden and Assange, to the contrary, Clinton has spoken about assassinating Assange with a drone. If that\u2019s how Democrats behave, then exactly how are they better? Just because they gave themselves a fancy name? What\u2019s so democratic about them? Also, the founding fathers of the US had assigned great importance to limiting the power of the government. Which is why they limited the presidential term to 8 years. They did not mean for it to be 8 years for the husband, then 8 years for the wife. That\u2019s cheating. If we are not worried about nepotism anymore, just amend the Constitution, and I\u2019ll vote Bill. Because there is no doubt that Bill is the talented person in that family. To get all the nepotism Clintons have amassed over the years of their reign, without Bill\u2019s talent, is a double lose. And perhaps a more pertinent question is - what\u2019s so darn good about Hillary? What made her an attractive candidate in the first place? I\u2019ll tell you: she is a woman. And Bill\u2019s wife. And that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t mind voting for a woman. I did not want to elect a US President based on gender. That would be sexist, no? If I did want to elect a woman, I would have preferred to vote for an independent woman who came to power through who she is, not through marrying the right guy. * Bill Clinton certainly deserved some trouble from Hillary. NOT from his country. It should have been irrelevant to the country, as it had no bearings whatsoever on his ability to function as a national leader. Now, staring a war in Serbia, bombing children just to distract from the blue dress, different story. ** Underreported at the time, but I\u2019ve read all the raw materials online",

She was the poster child for a certain kind of unapologetic feminism. You can see it here in her \u201ccould have stayed home and baked cookies\u201d statement, given in response to a rude question from a reporter:There were all kinds of right wing conspiracy theories against the Clintons in the 90s. When people are subjected to such a barrage of negativity, a perception that some of it must have been deserved sets in. The barrage of conspiracy theories against Hillary basically never stopped. It\u2019s impossible to be an American Conservative and not have absorbed at least some of it.She is a pragmatist. If she supports gay rights but the rest of the country doesn\u2019t support it, she\u2019ll support advancing gay rights as far as politically feasible. She\u2019s not going to campaign on idealism that she has no chance of enacting into policy. Some people view that as exceedingly calculating and untrustworthy.She is very pro-military intervention. A lot of people on the left dislike that.She is too comfortable with the big Banks. A lot of liberals, especially those of my generation, really, really, really don\u2019t like that.I think those are the main reasons, as I see it."

However, one thing almost anyone who knows him agrees on is that he is a force to be reckoned with.

With his natural ability to train and recall large volumes of information he was able to use these books as a foundation to learn and understand more at a faster pace.  When he hired his first engineers he quizzed them non-stop about every single detail or every task they were completing, and the thinking behind each action. Many early engineers at SpaceX believed he was testing them but soon realized he was using them as a means of educating himself on the industry the science behind it. Combined with his hands on work ethic and nothing is impossible attitude he has become as knowledgable or even more so than his engineers and scientists throughout his tenure as CEO of SpaceX. So in short, it's a combination of self-education, his inquisitive nature, a natural ability to store and recall volumes of text, and good old fashioned experience. Nothing is impossible, and Elon Musk proves that  to the world and himself every single day. ",

This is just a small example of how Elon Musk\u2019s genius memory works. When he wanted to go into the rocket business, he first tried to buy rockets from people (mostly Russian because they were cheaper) in order to go to execute his ideas of the Mars mission. Though this all seemed to expensive and he flew back to the United States with his companions. When they landed, he announced the idea of building the rocket himself, as he researched what parts were needed, calculated the costs in a spreadsheet, and came to the conclusion he could do it a lot cheaper than it was to buy a rocket. He showed this to his more experienced companion, and it seemed to be almost perfectly right. He then started trying to figure out how it actually worked so he read a lot of books about Rockets, and how the engineering worked, by this time he was becoming almost as knowledgable as your average engineer in about every significant area. When spaceX was launched, he hired some of the most talented college grads and also some more experienced engineers, which he started to build the rocket with. While on the working floor he would regularly ask an engineer to completely explain what he was doing, why he was doing it and every single piece of theory behind it, he would sometimes ask questions for hours. This, combined with the extreme pace and quality at which Elon Musk can absorb information and actually use it right away, makes him very qualified at almost every engineering discipline.",

After unsuccessfully negotiating with the Russians, who treated Elon Musk like a little boy. Both Cantrell, Musk, and Griffin (another guy who Elon recruited to go to Russia with him) were feeling down as they were sitting on their plane for the flight home. When all of a sudden, Musk wheels around and flashes them a spreadsheet he\u2019d created. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we can build this rocket ourselves.\u201d Naturally, neither Griffin nor Cantrell thought Musk was being serious. Musk explains, however, that this spreadsheet detailed the costs of the materials needed to build, assemble, and launch a rocket. According to Musk\u2019s calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modest-sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space. Cantrell asks, bewildered, \u201cElon, where did you get this?\u201d Musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics behind it. From Cantrell and others, he\u2019d borrowed \u201cRocket Propulsion Elements,\u201d \u201cFundamentals of Astrodynamics,\u201d and \u201cAerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion,\u201d along with several more seminal texts. Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and had emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets could and should be made cheaper than what the Russians were offering.So, to answer your question, he came to this epiphany about rockets through reading books and texts about rocket propulsion, etc. This is largely how he eventually had enough knowledge to start the company.

            "Elon Musk is widely regarded as an intelligent and innovative individual. He is known for his work in founding and leading several successful technology companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. Musk's ability to envision and execute ambitious projects, such as electric vehicles, space exploration, and renewable energy, has earned him a reputation for being exceptionally intelligent and forward-thinking. However, it's important to note that intelligence can be subjective and multifaceted, and individuals may excel in different areas.",

I know how hard it is to build complex systems. I know how difficult it is to achieve commercial success in any industry. Elon Musk is the most fearless entrepreneur/visionary in history. Creating an electric car company was lunacy, especially so far away from Detroit, and he pulled it off, completely changing the trajectory of one of the largest and most complex industries on the planet. History will look back on the success of the Tesla Model S as a turning point in the technological development of the automobile (i.e. goodbye internal combustion engine). Like Steve Jobs, Musk is a product visionary, understanding how good a revolutionary new product (the Tesla Model S) needed to be for consumer acceptance and he was relentless at making it such; when it came out, Consumer Reports magazine said it may be the best car ever built. I\u2019ve owned two Teslas and I agree. And, simultaneously, why not start a private space company, an even crazier idea. How hard could it be to develop the AI to land a reusable booster rocket vertically on a floating platform smaller than a parking lot when NATION STATES have tried to do it and failed? Once again, relentless vision and the refusal to fail. Yes, he didn\u2019t personally engineer the Tesla, he didn\u2019t personally design t...",

They may not be inspirational to you. Inspiration is somewhat of a risk: it takes you outside the world you once knew and introduces you to a new thought, person, idea, or something totally unexpected.  So I wrote down the quotes and what I think I learned from them. Maybe as I think of them more I'll learn more. I don't know.  Here are the inspirational quotes from Elon Musk that stuck with me:  1. \u201cIf something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.\u201d I was thinking: what if it really is impossible.  But Elon Musk then takes it to the next level always: \"let's go to Mars\".  Or \"let's make a billion dollar battery factory.\" So at the very least it's always worth exploring the delicious curvature of the impossible.  2. \u201cGoing from PayPal, I thought: \u2018Well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity?\u2019 Not from the perspective, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to make money?\u201d I've interviewed over 100 people now on my podcast. Each of the 100 have achieved amazing results in their life.  That's a subjective opinion. \"Amazing\" to me.  But none of them have done if for the money. I was talking to Coolio, for instance, who had the best selling song of 1995.  He started writing lyrics every day in 1977. It took him 17 years to have a single hit.  \"Never do something for the money,\" Coolio told me.  3. \u201c(Physics is) a good framework for thinking. \u2026 Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.\u201d My guess is he is not referring specifically to the science and theories of physics but the act of visualizing something, coming up with an idea or a theory of why it might be true, and then figuring out how to prove that theory.  To me, thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing, which is another fascinating aspect of physics.  4. \u201cThe first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.\u201d I wonder about this. What's impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out.  But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don't ever need the gas part.  Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities.  5. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.\u201d Many people think entrepreneurship is about risk. In fact, it's the opposite. Good entrepreneurs don't learn by failure (the popular \"failure porn\" all over the Internet). Good entrepreneurs learn by solving difficult problems.  Elon Musk controlled his outcome with X . com not by destroying the competitor but by merging with it (paypal).  6. \u201cPersistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.\u201d I always think this is the magic equation:  persistence + love = abundance.  You have to love something enough to persist. You have to persist enough to deepen your love.  And then abundance is the natural outcome. Not just for you but for everyone. Since wealth comes to those who create wealth for others.  7. \u201cYou want to have a future where you\u2019re expecting things to be better, not one where you\u2019re expecting things to be worse.\u201d This is incredibly important. News reporters have zero qualifications to inform people and yet they are all doom and gloom to sell subscriptions.  But entrepreneurs are the ones who imagine a better world and how to make the leap to get there.  8. \u201cIt is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who don\u2019t know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.\u201d When I was running a software company, we always knew it would take one great programmer to solve a hard problem in one night versus 10 mediocre programmers taking a month to screw up a problem even worse.  9. \u201cIf you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic \u2013 being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.\u201d And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today. \"They had to actually 'connect' to an Internet then!\" or \"It took them 7 hours to get from NY to CA!\"  10. \u201cMy biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someone\u2019s talent and not someone\u2019s personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.\u201d I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company.  Integrity, humility, and doing your best is by far the most important consideration when evaluating whether to work for someone.  12. \u201cWhen I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world. Now I am.\u201d I always wonder about the phrase \"change the world\". Can one person change another.  Perhaps the most valuable starting point is to do everything I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful.  Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world.  13. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have a feedback loop, where you\u2019re constantly thinking about what you\u2019ve done and how you could be doing it better. I think that\u2019s the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.\u201d I'm invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack.  Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity.  What could be wrong with it?  So it's important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail.  14. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I have a lack of fear. In fact, I\u2019d like my fear emotion to be less because it\u2019s very distracting and fries my nervous system.\u201d A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans.  Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he's peripherally involved in.  Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: \"What is my plan B?\" and \"What is my evil plan?\" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects 15. \u201cLife is too short for long-term grudges.\u201d I always think that I'm the average of the five people I spend the most time with.  So this quote is important to me. Don't spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me. 16. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of new arenas.\u201d Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you've never been before.  I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone.  One time I was talking to Noah Kagan and he suggested something simple: next time you go for coffee, ask for a 10% discount after they ring up your order.  This sounds trite compared with planning a ship to Mars but it really made me nervous when I tried it. It was good practice. Maybe next thing will be the trip to Mars.  17. \u201cI think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.\u201d I thought about this when I read it. I think it's ok for \"ordinary\" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful.  But I think every day it's worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can't be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude.  Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don't want the pressure of \"future extraordinary\". I just want to be a little better today 18. \u201cI could either watch it happen or be a part of it.\u201d Sometimes people say to me, \"I missed the boat\" or \"I am too late\". I think it's never too late to do what you love.\" What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms. 19. \u201cBeing an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death\u201d People say to me, \"I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur.\"  Entrepreneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around.  Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow.  I like Elon Musks's approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn't take up all the mind space. 20. \"I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.\" I highly recomend Andy Weir's book, \"The Martian\". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie.  Discusses this very topic. 21. On his favorite book when he was a teen, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy.\" Here's my favorite part of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel.  Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key 22. \"I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don't retire before I go senile, then I'll do more damage than good at that point.\" \"Retirement\" is an interesting word, invented by the actuaries who used statistics to come up with social security.  So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire.  In fact, from a mortality perspective the two most dangerous years in life are the year you are born and the year you retire. ------So I never interviewed him. But maybe read and watched several dozen interviews and wrote down my favorite quotes.  Then I wrote what I learned from them. I want to learn from everyone. That's how I get inspired. If you don't agree with me, maybe you learned different things.  But I like these quotes and I hope this somewhat fits the answer.",

With his natural ability to train and recall large volumes of information he was able to use these books as a foundation to learn and understand more at a faster pace.  When he hired his first engineers he quizzed them non-stop about every single detail or every task they were completing, and the thinking behind each action. Many early engineers at SpaceX believed he was testing them but soon realized he was using them as a means of educating himself on the industry the science behind it. Combined with his hands on work ethic and nothing is impossible attitude he has become as knowledgable or even more so than his engineers and scientists throughout his tenure as CEO of SpaceX. So in short, it's a combination of self-education, his inquisitive nature, a natural ability to store and recall volumes of text, and good old fashioned experience. Nothing is impossible, and Elon Musk proves that  to the world and himself every single day. ",

I have read the book about Elon Musk, and furthermore a lot of online articles and information about the man, therefore I feel somewhat qualified to answer this.j Since Elon Musk was young, he could soak up information at a pace almost no one else could, he learned the entire programming language BASIC (or at least the course he had gotten when he was a child) in one night, while it was supposed to take 3 weeks. This is just a small example of how Elon Musk\u2019s genius memory works. When he wanted to go into the rocket business, he first tried to buy rockets from people (mostly Russian because they were cheaper) in order to go to execute his ideas of the Mars mission. Though this all seemed to expensive and he flew back to the United States with his companions. When they landed, he announced the idea of building the rocket himself, as he researched what parts were needed, calculated the costs in a spreadsheet, and came to the conclusion he could do it a lot cheaper than it was to buy a rocket. He showed this to his more experienced companion, and it seemed to be almost perfectly right. He then started trying to figure out how it actually worked so he read a lot of books about Rockets, and how the engineering worked, by this time he was becoming almost as knowledgable as your average engineer in about every significant area. When spaceX was launched, he hired some of the most talented college grads and also some more experienced engineers, which he started to build the rocket with. While on the working floor he would regularly ask an engineer to completely explain what he was doing, why he was doing it and every single piece of theory behind it, he would sometimes ask questions for hours. This, combined with the extreme pace and quality at which Elon Musk can absorb information and actually use it right away, makes him very qualified at almost every engineering discipline.",

Elon Musk, before starting SpaceX, wanted to discover how much a potential launch would cost, so he plotted a trip to Russia. Musk planned to buy a refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, from Russians and use that as his launch vehicle. For help, Elon reached out to Jim Cantrell, an individual accused of espionage and placed under house arrest in 1996 by the Russians\u2014so naturally, a fantastic choice. After unsuccessfully negotiating with the Russians, who treated Elon Musk like a little boy. Both Cantrell, Musk, and Griffin (another guy who Elon recruited to go to Russia with him) were feeling down as they were sitting on their plane for the flight home. When all of a sudden, Musk wheels around and flashes them a spreadsheet he\u2019d created. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we can build this rocket ourselves.\u201d Naturally, neither Griffin nor Cantrell thought Musk was being serious. Musk explains, however, that this spreadsheet detailed the costs of the materials needed to build, assemble, and launch a rocket. According to Musk\u2019s calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modest-sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space. Cantrell asks, bewildered, \u201cElon, where did you get this?\u201d Musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics behind it. From Cantrell and others, he\u2019d borrowed \u201cRocket Propulsion Elements,\u201d \u201cFundamentals of Astrodynamics,\u201d and \u201cAerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion,\u201d along with several more seminal texts. Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and had emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets could and should be made cheaper than what the Russians were offering.So, to answer your question, he came to this epiphany about rockets through reading books and texts about rocket propulsion, etc. This is largely how he eventually had enough knowledge to start the company.

            "I personally feel what Elon Musk is doing is in a completely different dimension. In many ways (especially given the launch of Falcon 9 today), what Musk already accomplished put him in a level where he shouldn't be compared to anyone. Jobs changed how individuals live and interact in their daily lives. Musk is on a path to change how humanity will function as a whole. Both are very special individuals. While Jobs' impact was felt immediately within a span of a few years, I don't believe Musk's true legacy will be defined by anyone in our generations.",

I know how hard it is to build complex systems. I know how difficult it is to achieve commercial success in any industry. Elon Musk is the most fearless entrepreneur/visionary in history. Creating an electric car company was lunacy, especially so far away from Detroit, and he pulled it off, completely changing the trajectory of one of the largest and most complex industries on the planet. History will look back on the success of the Tesla Model S as a turning point in the technological development of the automobile (i.e. goodbye internal combustion engine). Like Steve Jobs, Musk is a product visionary, understanding how good a revolutionary new product (the Tesla Model S) needed to be for consumer acceptance and he was relentless at making it such; when it came out, Consumer Reports magazine said it may be the best car ever built. I\u2019ve owned two Teslas and I agree. And, simultaneously, why not start a private space company, an even crazier idea. How hard could it be to develop the AI to land a reusable booster rocket vertically on a floating platform smaller than a parking lot when NATION STATES have tried to do it and failed? Once again, relentless vision and the refusal to fail. Yes, he didn\u2019t personally engineer the Tesla, he didn\u2019t personally design the SpaceX rockets, but he has the vision, tenacity and engineering smarts to take on impossible tasks and succeed where most would fail. That takes far more than money or luck. I\u2019ve come across plenty of academics that couldn\u2019t engineer their way out of a paper bag. Many people who start with their daddy\u2019s millions are lucky to see any real success. Mr. Musk\u2019s success comes from an uncanny ability to see the future ahead of others, extreme intelligence, relentless tenacity, and a finite refusal to put out an inferior product or service. Finally, he has an inhuman belief that he can do anything. Yes, he is awe inspiring.",

As such, talent is more important in all his companies when sourcing for new employees, instead of mere college degrees or diplomas. He also realized that if you wanted knowledge, then schools were the worst places to look for it. He realized early that what schools were teaching was the wrong education, so he decided to create his own school and curriculum which he thinks will help his children\u2019s future. He is smart enough to find knowledge when he needs it, where he needs it, and why he needs it. To maintain his sharpness, he keeps a list of books which he reads daily. With no formal education in aeronautical engineering, he was smart enough to setup SpaceX\u2014the first private aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company to enable cheaper space travel and the colonization of Mars. He was smart enough to realize that some of the smartest people on the planet like Bill Gates, Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs, were college dropouts. He also realized that knowledge is free. It was free before the Internet and it has been made even more free following the invention, proliferation, and availability of the Internet. He was smart enough to start Zip2 and X.com, which merged with Confinity to become PayPal\u2014which was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion, earning Elon Musk a tidy sum of $165 million. He was smart enough to use the funds earned from Zip2, X.com, and PayPal to move into a different direction. He was smart enough to be associated with Tesla, Inc, a revolutionary electric vehicle and clean energy company that manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. He was smart enough to assemble and lead a team of rocket scientists at SpaceX, which has partnered with NASA and other international space agencies. On November 15, 2020, SpaceX launched 4 astronauts in space, to the International Space Station on the first full-fledged taxi flight for NASA by a private company. I think that\u2019s SMART.

They may not be inspirational to you. Inspiration is somewhat of a risk: it takes you outside the world you once knew and introduces you to a new thought, person, idea, or something totally unexpected.  So I wrote down the quotes and what I think I learned from them. Maybe as I think of them more I'll learn more. I don't know.  Here are the inspirational quotes from Elon Musk that stuck with me:  1. \u201cIf something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.\u201d I was thinking: what if it really is impossible.  But Elon Musk then takes it to the next level always: \"let's go to Mars\".  Or \"let's make a billion dollar battery factory.\" So at the very least it's always worth exploring the delicious curvature of the impossible.  2. \u201cGoing from PayPal, I thought: \u2018Well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity?\u2019 Not from the perspective, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to make money?\u201d I've interviewed over 100 people now on my podcast. Each of the 100 have achieved amazing results in their life.  That's a subjective opinion. \"Amazing\" to me.  But none of them have done if for the money. I was talking to Coolio, for instance, who had the best selling song of 1995.  He started writing lyrics every day in 1977. It took him 17 years to have a single hit.  \"Never do something for the money,\" Coolio told me.  3. \u201c(Physics is) a good framework for thinking. \u2026 Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.\u201d My guess is he is not referring specifically to the science and theories of physics but the act of visualizing something, coming up with an idea or a theory of why it might be true, and then figuring out how to prove that theory.  To me, thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing, which is another fascinating aspect of physics.  4. \u201cThe first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.\u201d I wonder about this. What's impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out.  But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don't ever need the gas part.  Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities.  5. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.\u201d Many people think entrepreneurship is about risk. In fact, it's the opposite. Good entrepreneurs don't learn by failure (the popular \"failure porn\" all over the Internet). Good entrepreneurs learn by solving difficult problems.  Elon Musk controlled his outcome with X . com not by destroying the competitor but by merging with it (paypal).  6. \u201cPersistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.\u201d I always think this is the magic equation:  persistence + love = abundance.  You have to love something enough to persist. You have to persist enough to deepen your love.  And then abundance is the natural outcome. Not just for you but for everyone. Since wealth comes to those who create wealth for others.  7. \u201cYou want to have a future where you\u2019re expecting things to be better, not one where you\u2019re expecting things to be worse.\u201d This is incredibly important. News reporters have zero qualifications to inform people and yet they are all doom and gloom to sell subscriptions.  But entrepreneurs are the ones who imagine a better world and how to make the leap to get there.  8. \u201cIt is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who don\u2019t know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.\u201d When I was running a software company, we always knew it would take one great programmer to solve a hard problem in one night versus 10 mediocre programmers taking a month to screw up a problem even worse.  9. \u201cIf you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic \u2013 being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.\u201d And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today. \"They had to actually 'connect' to an Internet then!\" or \"It took them 7 hours to get from NY to CA!\"  10. \u201cMy biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someone\u2019s talent and not someone\u2019s personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.\u201d I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company.  Integrity, humility, and doing your best is by far the most important consideration when evaluating whether to work for someone.  12. \u201cWhen I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world. Now I am.\u201d I always wonder about the phrase \"change the world\". Can one person change another.  Perhaps the most valuable starting point is to do everything I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful.  Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world.  13. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have a feedback loop, where you\u2019re constantly thinking about what you\u2019ve done and how you could be doing it better. I think that\u2019s the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.\u201d I'm invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack.  Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity.  What could be wrong with it?  So it's important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail.  14. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I have a lack of fear. In fact, I\u2019d like my fear emotion to be less because it\u2019s very distracting and fries my nervous system.\u201d A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans.  Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he's peripherally involved in.  Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: \"What is my plan B?\" and \"What is my evil plan?\" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects 15. \u201cLife is too short for long-term grudges.\u201d I always think that I'm the average of the five people I spend the most time with.  So this quote is important to me. Don't spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me. 16. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of new arenas.\u201d Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you've never been before.  I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone.  One time I was talking to Noah Kagan and he suggested something simple: next time you go for coffee, ask for a 10% discount after they ring up your order.  This sounds trite compared with planning a ship to Mars but it really made me nervous when I tried it. It was good practice. Maybe next thing will be the trip to Mars.  17. \u201cI think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.\u201d I thought about this when I read it. I think it's ok for \"ordinary\" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful.  But I think every day it's worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can't be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude.  Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don't want the pressure of \"future extraordinary\". I just want to be a little better today 18. \u201cI could either watch it happen or be a part of it.\u201d Sometimes people say to me, \"I missed the boat\" or \"I am too late\". I think it's never too late to do what you love.\" What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms. 19. \u201cBeing an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death\u201d People say to me, \"I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur.\"  Entrepreneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around.  Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow.  I like Elon Musks's approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn't take up all the mind space. 20. \"I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.\" I highly recomend Andy Weir's book, \"The Martian\". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie.  Discusses this very topic. 21. On his favorite book when he was a teen, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy.\" Here's my favorite part of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel.  Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key 22. \"I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don't retire before I go senile, then I'll do more damage than good at that point.\" \"Retirement\" is an interesting word, invented by the actuaries who used statistics to come up with social security.  So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire.  In fact, from a mortality perspective the two most dangerous years in life are the year you are born and the year you retire. ------So I never interviewed him. But maybe read and watched several dozen interviews and wrote down my favorite quotes.  Then I wrote what I learned from them. I want to learn from everyone. That's how I get inspired. If you don't agree with me, maybe you learned different things.  But I like these quotes and I hope this somewhat fits the answer.",

However, one thing almost anyone who knows him agrees on is that he is a force to be reckoned with.

With his natural ability to train and recall large volumes of information he was able to use these books as a foundation to learn and understand more at a faster pace.  When he hired his first engineers he quizzed them non-stop about every single detail or every task they were completing, and the thinking behind each action. Many early engineers at SpaceX believed he was testing them but soon realized he was using them as a means of educating himself on the industry the science behind it. Combined with his hands on work ethic and nothing is impossible attitude he has become as knowledgable or even more so than his engineers and scientists throughout his tenure as CEO of SpaceX. So in short, it's a combination of self-education, his inquisitive nature, a natural ability to store and recall volumes of text, and good old fashioned experience. Nothing is impossible, and Elon Musk proves that  to the world and himself every single day. ",

I have read the book about Elon Musk, and furthermore a lot of online articles and information about the man, therefore I feel somewhat qualified to answer this.j Since Elon Musk was young, he could soak up information at a pace almost no one else could, he learned the entire programming language BASIC (or at least the course he had gotten when he was a child) in one night, while it was supposed to take 3 weeks. This is just a small example of how Elon Musk\u2019s genius memory works. When he wanted to go into the rocket business, he first tried to buy rockets from people (mostly Russian because they were cheaper) in order to go to execute his ideas of the Mars mission. Though this all seemed to expensive and he flew back to the United States with his companions. When they landed, he announced the idea of building the rocket himself, as he researched what parts were needed, calculated the costs in a spreadsheet, and came to the conclusion he could do it a lot cheaper than it was to buy a rocket. He showed this to his more experienced companion, and it seemed to be almost perfectly right. He then started trying to figure out how it actually worked so he read a lot of books about Rockets, and how the engineering worked, by this time he was becoming almost as knowledgable as your average engineer in about every significant area. When spaceX was launched, he hired some of the most talented college grads and also some more experienced engineers, which he started to build the rocket with. While on the working floor he would regularly ask an engineer to completely explain what he was doing, why he was doing it and every single piece of theory behind it, he would sometimes ask questions for hours. This, combined with the extreme pace and quality at which Elon Musk can absorb information and actually use it right away, makes him very qualified at almost every engineering discipline.",

Elon Musk, before starting SpaceX, wanted to discover how much a potential launch would cost, so he plotted a trip to Russia. Musk planned to buy a refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, from Russians and use that as his launch vehicle. For help, Elon reached out to Jim Cantrell, an individual accused of espionage and placed under house arrest in 1996 by the Russians\u2014so naturally, a fantastic choice. After unsuccessfully negotiating with the Russians, who treated Elon Musk like a little boy. Both Cantrell, Musk, and Griffin (another guy who Elon recruited to go to Russia with him) were feeling down as they were sitting on their plane for the flight home. When all of a sudden, Musk wheels around and flashes them a spreadsheet he\u2019d created. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we can build this rocket ourselves.\u201d Naturally, neither Griffin nor Cantrell thought Musk was being serious. Musk explains, however, that this spreadsheet detailed the costs of the materials needed to build, assemble, and launch a rocket. According to Musk\u2019s calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modest-sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space. Cantrell asks, bewildered, \u201cElon, where did you get this?\u201d Musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics behind it. From Cantrell and others, he\u2019d borrowed \u201cRocket Propulsion Elements,\u201d \u201cFundamentals of Astrodynamics,\u201d and \u201cAerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion,\u201d along with several more seminal texts. Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and had emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets could and should be made cheaper than what the Russians were offering.So, to answer your question, he came to this epiphany about rockets through reading books and texts about rocket propulsion, etc. This is largely how he eventually had enough knowledge to start the company.

In many ways (especially given the launch of Falcon 9 today), what Musk already accomplished put him in a level where he shouldn't be compared to anyone. Jobs changed how individuals live and interact in their daily lives. Musk is on a path to change how humanity will function as a whole. Both are very special individuals.

I know how hard it is to build complex systems. I know how difficult it is to achieve commercial success in any industry. Elon Musk is the most fearless entrepreneur/visionary in history. Creating an electric car company was lunacy, especially so far away from Detroit, and he pulled it off, completely changing the trajectory of one of the largest and most complex industries on the planet. History will look back on the success of the Tesla Model S as a turning point in the technological development of the automobile (i.e. goodbye internal combustion engine). Like Steve Jobs, Musk is a product visionary, understanding how good a revolutionary new product (the Tesla Model S) needed to be for consumer acceptance and he was relentless at making it such; when it came out, Consumer Reports magazine said it may be the best car ever built. I\u2019ve owned two Teslas and I agree. And, simultaneously, why not start a private space company, an even crazier idea.

As such, talent is more important in all his companies when sourcing for new employees, instead of mere college degrees or diplomas. He also realized that if you wanted knowledge, then schools were the worst places to look for it. He realized early that what schools were teaching was the wrong education, so he decided to create his own school and curriculum which he thinks will help his children\u2019s future. He is smart enough to find knowledge when he needs it, where he needs it, and why he needs it. To maintain his sharpness, he keeps a list of books which he reads daily. With no formal education in aeronautical engineering, he was smart enough to setup SpaceX\u2014the first private aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company to enable cheaper space travel and the colonization of Mars. He was smart enough to realize that some of the smartest people on the planet like Bill Gates, Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs, were college dropouts. He also realized that knowledge is free. It was free before the Internet and it has been made even more free following the invention, proliferation, and availability of the Internet. He was smart enough to start Zip2 and X.com, which merged with Confinity to become PayPal\u2014which was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion, earning Elon Musk a tidy sum of $165 million. He was smart enough to use the funds earned from Zip2, X.com, and PayPal to move into a different direction. He was smart enough to be associated with Tesla, Inc, a revolutionary electric vehicle and clean energy company that manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. He was smart enough to assemble and lead a team of rocket scientists at SpaceX, which has partnered with NASA and other international space agencies. On November 15, 2020, SpaceX launched 4 astronauts in space, to the International Space Station on the first full-fledged taxi flight for NASA by a private company. I think that\u2019s SMART.

They may not be inspirational to you. Inspiration is somewhat of a risk: it takes you outside the world you once knew and introduces you to a new thought, person, idea, or something totally unexpected.  So I wrote down the quotes and what I think I learned from them. Maybe as I think of them more I'll learn more. I don't know.  Here are the inspirational quotes from Elon Musk that stuck with me:  1. \u201cIf something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.\u201d I was thinking: what if it really is impossible.  But Elon Musk then takes it to the next level always: \"let's go to Mars\".  Or \"let's make a billion dollar battery factory.\" So at the very least it's always worth exploring the delicious curvature of the impossible.  2. \u201cGoing from PayPal, I thought: \u2018Well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity?\u2019 Not from the perspective, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to make money?\u201d I've interviewed over 100 people now on my podcast. Each of the 100 have achieved amazing results in their life.  That's a subjective opinion. \"Amazing\" to me.  But none of them have done if for the money. I was talking to Coolio, for instance, who had the best selling song of 1995.  He started writing lyrics every day in 1977. It took him 17 years to have a single hit.  \"Never do something for the money,\" Coolio told me.  3. \u201c(Physics is) a good framework for thinking. \u2026 Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.\u201d My guess is he is not referring specifically to the science and theories of physics but the act of visualizing something, coming up with an idea or a theory of why it might be true, and then figuring out how to prove that theory.  To me, thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing, which is another fascinating aspect of physics.  4. \u201cThe first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.\u201d I wonder about this. What's impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out.  But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don't ever need the gas part.  Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities.  5. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.\u201d Many people think entrepreneurship is about risk. In fact, it's the opposite. Good entrepreneurs don't learn by failure (the popular \"failure porn\" all over the Internet). Good entrepreneurs learn by solving difficult problems.  Elon Musk controlled his outcome with X . com not by destroying the competitor but by merging with it (paypal).  6. \u201cPersistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.\u201d I always think this is the magic equation:  persistence + love = abundance.  You have to love something enough to persist. You have to persist enough to deepen your love.  And then abundance is the natural outcome. Not just for you but for everyone. Since wealth comes to those who create wealth for others.  7. \u201cYou want to have a future where you\u2019re expecting things to be better, not one where you\u2019re expecting things to be worse.\u201d This is incredibly important. News reporters have zero qualifications to inform people and yet they are all doom and gloom to sell subscriptions.  But entrepreneurs are the ones who imagine a better world and how to make the leap to get there.  8. \u201cIt is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who don\u2019t know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.\u201d When I was running a software company, we always knew it would take one great programmer to solve a hard problem in one night versus 10 mediocre programmers taking a month to screw up a problem even worse.  9. \u201cIf you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic \u2013 being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.\u201d And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today. \"They had to actually 'connect' to an Internet then!\" or \"It took them 7 hours to get from NY to CA!\"  10. \u201cMy biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someone\u2019s talent and not someone\u2019s personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.\u201d I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company.  Integrity, humility, and doing your best is by far the most important consideration when evaluating whether to work for someone.  12. \u201cWhen I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world. Now I am.\u201d I always wonder about the phrase \"change the world\". Can one person change another.  Perhaps the most valuable starting point is to do everything I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful.  Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world.  13. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have a feedback loop, where you\u2019re constantly thinking about what you\u2019ve done and how you could be doing it better. I think that\u2019s the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.\u201d I'm invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack.  Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity.  What could be wrong with it?  So it's important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail.  14. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I have a lack of fear. In fact, I\u2019d like my fear emotion to be less because it\u2019s very distracting and fries my nervous system.\u201d A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans.  Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he's peripherally involved in.  Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: \"What is my plan B?\" and \"What is my evil plan?\" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects 15. \u201cLife is too short for long-term grudges.\u201d I always think that I'm the average of the five people I spend the most time with.  So this quote is important to me. Don't spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me. 16. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of new arenas.\u201d Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you've never been before.  I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone.  One time I was talking to Noah Kagan and he suggested something simple: next time you go for coffee, ask for a 10% discount after they ring up your order.  This sounds trite compared with planning a ship to Mars but it really made me nervous when I tried it. It was good practice. Maybe next thing will be the trip to Mars.  17. \u201cI think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.\u201d I thought about this when I read it. I think it's ok for \"ordinary\" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful.  But I think every day it's worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can't be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude.  Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don't want the pressure of \"future extraordinary\". I just want to be a little better today 18. \u201cI could either watch it happen or be a part of it.\u201d Sometimes people say to me, \"I missed the boat\" or \"I am too late\". I think it's never too late to do what you love.\" What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms. 19. \u201cBeing an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death\u201d People say to me, \"I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur.\"  Entrepreneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around.  Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow.  I like Elon Musks's approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn't take up all the mind space. 20. \"I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.\" I highly recomend Andy Weir's book, \"The Martian\". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie.  Discusses this very topic. 21. On his favorite book when he was a teen, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy.\" Here's my favorite part of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel.  Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key 22. \"I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don't retire before I go senile, then I'll do more damage than good at that point.\" \"Retirement\" is an interesting word, invented by the actuaries who used statistics to come up with social security.  So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire.  In fact, from a mortality perspective the two most dangerous years in life are the year you are born and the year you retire. ------So I never interviewed him. But maybe read and watched several dozen interviews and wrote down my favorite quotes.  Then I wrote what I learned from them. I want to learn from everyone. That's how I get inspired. If you don't agree with me, maybe you learned different things.  But I like these quotes and I hope this somewhat fits the answer.",

Elon Musk\u2019s army of rabid haterz are also a bunch of idiots. A lot of folks really struggle with nuance and complexity. They need people to be simple, black or white caricatures. A person must either be a hero or a villain, a savior or a schemer. The folks who say Elon Musk is an overrated poseur who never actually contributed anything at Tesla or SpaceX are morons who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s legit a genius and a fantastic engineer. I\u2019ve talked to bona-fide, actual rocket engineers who\u2019ve met Musk and say he\u2019s the real deal. He was integrally involved in the design of the Raptor rocket engine. The folks who say Elon Musk is a boy wonder who is amazing at everything he does are morons who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Elon has the social skills of potato salad and a peculiar and singularly toxic blend of self-absorption, entitlement, and narcissism that legit make him a terrible person to work for. Like many smart people, he believes his first thought on any subject, even if it\u2019s completely outside his wheelhouse, is Revealed Truth\u2122. He\u2019s succeeded splendidly at a few things, so he thinks that makes him infallible at everything. All these things can be true at the same time. The need to think he\u2019s a poseur moron because you don\u2019t like him is stupid. The need to see him as some kind of infallible tech saint because he\u2019s done amazing things at SpaceX is stupid. The most important thing we can learn from Elon Musk? How to avoid simplistic cartoon thinking. Not by example\u2014simplistic cartoon thinking virtually defines his approach to the world\u2014but in the way we think about him."

However, one thing almost anyone who knows him agrees on is that he is a force to be reckoned with. When he founded SpaceX his knowledge of aerospace and rocket engineering was very limited: read - none. He picked up textbooks on the subject and devoured them without rest. With his natural ability to train and recall large volumes of information he was able to use these books as a foundation to learn and understand more at a faster pace.  When he hired his first engineers he quizzed them non-stop about every single detail or every task they were completing, and the thinking behind each action. Many early engineers at SpaceX believed he was testing them but soon realized he was using them as a means of educating himself on the industry the science behind it. Combined with his hands on work ethic and nothing is impossible attitude he has become as knowledgable or even more so than his engineers and scientists throughout his tenure as CEO of SpaceX. So in short, it's a combination of self-education, his inquisitive nature, a natural ability to store and recall volumes of text, and good old fashioned experience. Nothing is impossible, and Elon Musk proves that  to the world and himself every single day. ",

I have read the book about Elon Musk, and furthermore a lot of online articles and information about the man, therefore I feel somewhat qualified to answer this.j Since Elon Musk was young, he could soak up information at a pace almost no one else could, he learned the entire programming language BASIC (or at least the course he had gotten when he was a child) in one night, while it was supposed to take 3 weeks. This is just a small example of how Elon Musk\u2019s genius memory works. When he wanted to go into the rocket business, he first tried to buy rockets from people (mostly Russian because they were cheaper) in order to go to execute his ideas of the Mars mission. Though this all seemed to expensive and he flew back to the United States with his companions. When they landed, he announced the idea of building the rocket himself, as he researched what parts were needed, calculated the costs in a spreadsheet, and came to the conclusion he could do it a lot cheaper than it was to buy a rocket. He showed this to his more experienced companion, and it seemed to be almost perfectly right. He then started trying to figure out how it actually worked so he read a lot of books about Rockets, and how the engineering worked, by this time he was becoming almost as knowledgable as your average engineer in about every significant area. When spaceX was launched, he hired some of the most talented college grads and also some more experienced engineers, which he started to build the rocket with. While on the working floor he would regularly ask an engineer to completely explain what he was doing, why he was doing it and every single piece of theory behind it, he would sometimes ask questions for hours. This, combined with the extreme pace and quality at which Elon Musk can absorb information and actually use it right away, makes him very qualified at almost every engineering discipline.",

After unsuccessfully negotiating with the Russians, who treated Elon Musk like a little boy. Both Cantrell, Musk, and Griffin (another guy who Elon recruited to go to Russia with him) were feeling down as they were sitting on their plane for the flight home. When all of a sudden, Musk wheels around and flashes them a spreadsheet he\u2019d created. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we can build this rocket ourselves.\u201d Naturally, neither Griffin nor Cantrell thought Musk was being serious. Musk explains, however, that this spreadsheet detailed the costs of the materials needed to build, assemble, and launch a rocket. According to Musk\u2019s calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modest-sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space. Cantrell asks, bewildered, \u201cElon, where did you get this?\u201d Musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics behind it. From Cantrell and others, he\u2019d borrowed \u201cRocket Propulsion Elements,\u201d \u201cFundamentals of Astrodynamics,\u201d and \u201cAerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion,\u201d along with several more seminal texts. Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and had emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets could and should be made cheaper than what the Russians were offering.So, to answer your question, he came to this epiphany about rockets through reading books and texts about rocket propulsion, etc. This is largely how he eventually had enough knowledge to start the company.

I know how hard it is to build complex systems. I know how difficult it is to achieve commercial success in any industry. Elon Musk is the most fearless entrepreneur/visionary in history. Creating an electric car company was lunacy, especially so far away from Detroit, and he pulled it off, completely changing the trajectory of one of the largest and most complex industries on the planet.

            "Elon Musk was smart enough to realize that schools were a waste of time. He did it at a time when most people were still chasing a worthless college degree.[Photo Credit: Susan Walsh/AP/Google] He realized that a college degree was just a piece of paper to prove to an employer you went to school.

He did it at a time when most people were still chasing a worthless college degree.[Photo Credit: Susan Walsh/AP/Google] He realized that a college degree was just a piece of paper to prove to an employer you went to school. As such, talent is more important in all his companies when sourcing for new employees, instead of mere college degrees or diplomas. He also realized that if you wanted knowledge, then schools were the worst places to look for it. He realized early that what schools were teaching was the wrong education, so he decided to create his own school and curriculum which he thinks will help his children\u2019s future. He is smart enough to find knowledge when he needs it, where he needs it, and why he needs it. To maintain his sharpness, he keeps a list of books which he reads daily. With no formal education in aeronautical engineering, he was smart enough to setup SpaceX\u2014the first private aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company to enable cheaper space travel and the colonization of Mars. He was smart enough to realize that some of the smartest people on the planet like Bill Gates, Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs, were college dropouts. He also realized that knowledge is free. It was free before the Internet and it has been made even more free following the invention, proliferation, and availability of the Internet. He was smart enough to start Zip2 and X.com, which merged with Confinity to become PayPal\u2014which was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion, earning Elon Musk a tidy sum of $165 million. He was smart enough to use the funds earned from Zip2, X.com, and PayPal to move into a different direction. He was smart enough to be associated with Tesla, Inc, a revolutionary electric vehicle and clean energy company that manufactures electric cars, battery energy storage, solar panels and solar roof tiles, and related products and services. He was smart enough to assemble and lead a team of rocket scientists at SpaceX, which has partnered with NASA and other international space agencies. On November 15, 2020, SpaceX launched 4 astronauts in space, to the International Space Station on the first full-fledged taxi flight for NASA by a private company. I think that\u2019s SMART. EDIT: Hey guys, thanks for your views, upvotes and comments, which I didn\u2019t expect the post to attract. 9.3K views and 210 upvotes in just 2 days cannot be taken lightly. For this reason I\u2019d like to update you with the latest news about Elon Musk, which I didn\u2019t have on Monday when I wrote the article. On Monday, November 23, 2020, Elon Musk overtook Bill Gates to become the world\u2019s second-richest person with a net worth of over $128 billion compared to Gates\u2019 $127.7 billion. The 49-year old chief executive officer of Tesla, overtook Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates after the electric car company he helped found 17 years ago soared in market value to more than $500 billion, leapfrogging his wealth by $7.2 billion, ahead of Tesla\u2019s debut on the S&P 500 Index.",

They may not be inspirational to you. Inspiration is somewhat of a risk: it takes you outside the world you once knew and introduces you to a new thought, person, idea, or something totally unexpected.  So I wrote down the quotes and what I think I learned from them. Maybe as I think of them more I'll learn more. I don't know.  Here are the inspirational quotes from Elon Musk that stuck with me:  1. \u201cIf something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.\u201d I was thinking: what if it really is impossible.  But Elon Musk then takes it to the next level always: \"let's go to Mars\".  Or \"let's make a billion dollar battery factory.\" So at the very least it's always worth exploring the delicious curvature of the impossible.  2. \u201cGoing from PayPal, I thought: \u2018Well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity?\u2019 Not from the perspective, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to make money?\u201d I've interviewed over 100 people now on my podcast. Each of the 100 have achieved amazing results in their life.  That's a subjective opinion. \"Amazing\" to me.  But none of them have done if for the money. I was talking to Coolio, for instance, who had the best selling song of 1995.  He started writing lyrics every day in 1977. It took him 17 years to have a single hit.  \"Never do something for the money,\" Coolio told me.  3. \u201c(Physics is) a good framework for thinking. \u2026 Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.\u201d My guess is he is not referring specifically to the science and theories of physics but the act of visualizing something, coming up with an idea or a theory of why it might be true, and then figuring out how to prove that theory.  To me, thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing, which is another fascinating aspect of physics.  4. \u201cThe first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.\u201d I wonder about this. What's impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out.  But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don't ever need the gas part.  Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities.  5. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.\u201d Many people think entrepreneurship is about risk. In fact, it's the opposite. Good entrepreneurs don't learn by failure (the popular \"failure porn\" all over the Internet). Good entrepreneurs learn by solving difficult problems.  Elon Musk controlled his outcome with X . com not by destroying the competitor but by merging with it (paypal).  6. \u201cPersistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.\u201d I always think this is the magic equation:  persistence + love = abundance.  You have to love something enough to persist. You have to persist enough to deepen your love.  And then abundance is the natural outcome. Not just for you but for everyone. Since wealth comes to those who create wealth for others.  7. \u201cYou want to have a future where you\u2019re expecting things to be better, not one where you\u2019re expecting things to be worse.\u201d This is incredibly important. News reporters have zero qualifications to inform people and yet they are all doom and gloom to sell subscriptions.  But entrepreneurs are the ones who imagine a better world and how to make the leap to get there.  8. \u201cIt is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who don\u2019t know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.\u201d When I was running a software company, we always knew it would take one great programmer to solve a hard problem in one night versus 10 mediocre programmers taking a month to screw up a problem even worse.  9. \u201cIf you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic \u2013 being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.\u201d And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today. \"They had to actually 'connect' to an Internet then!\" or \"It took them 7 hours to get from NY to CA!\"  10. \u201cMy biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someone\u2019s talent and not someone\u2019s personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.\u201d I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company.  Integrity, humility, and doing your best is by far the most important consideration when evaluating whether to work for someone.  12. \u201cWhen I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world. Now I am.\u201d I always wonder about the phrase \"change the world\". Can one person change another.  Perhaps the most valuable starting point is to do everything I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful.  Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world.  13. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have a feedback loop, where you\u2019re constantly thinking about what you\u2019ve done and how you could be doing it better. I think that\u2019s the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.\u201d I'm invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack.  Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity.  What could be wrong with it?  So it's important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail.  14. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I have a lack of fear. In fact, I\u2019d like my fear emotion to be less because it\u2019s very distracting and fries my nervous system.\u201d A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans.  Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he's peripherally involved in.  Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: \"What is my plan B?\" and \"What is my evil plan?\" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects 15. \u201cLife is too short for long-term grudges.\u201d I always think that I'm the average of the five people I spend the most time with.  So this quote is important to me. Don't spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me. 16. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of new arenas.\u201d Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you've never been before.  I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone.  One time I was talking to Noah Kagan and he suggested something simple: next time you go for coffee, ask for a 10% discount after they ring up your order.  This sounds trite compared with planning a ship to Mars but it really made me nervous when I tried it. It was good practice. Maybe next thing will be the trip to Mars.  17. \u201cI think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.\u201d I thought about this when I read it. I think it's ok for \"ordinary\" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful.  But I think every day it's worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can't be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude.  Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don't want the pressure of \"future extraordinary\". I just want to be a little better today 18. \u201cI could either watch it happen or be a part of it.\u201d Sometimes people say to me, \"I missed the boat\" or \"I am too late\". I think it's never too late to do what you love.\" What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms. 19. \u201cBeing an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death\u201d People say to me, \"I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur.\"  Entrepreneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around.  Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow.  I like Elon Musks's approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn't take up all the mind space. 20. \"I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.\" I highly recomend Andy Weir's book, \"The Martian\". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie.  Discusses this very topic. 21. On his favorite book when he was a teen, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy.\" Here's my favorite part of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel.  Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key 22. \"I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don't retire before I go senile, then I'll do more damage than good at that point.\" \"Retirement\" is an interesting word, invented by the actuaries who used statistics to come up with social security.  So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire.  In fact, from a mortality perspective the two most dangerous years in life are the year you are born and the year you retire. ------So I never interviewed him. But maybe read and watched several dozen interviews and wrote down my favorite quotes.  Then I wrote what I learned from them. I want to learn from everyone. That's how I get inspired. If you don't agree with me, maybe you learned different things.  But I like these quotes and I hope this somewhat fits the answer.",

Elon Musk\u2019s army of rabid haterz are also a bunch of idiots. A lot of folks really struggle with nuance and complexity. They need people to be simple, black or white caricatures. A person must either be a hero or a villain, a savior or a schemer. The folks who say Elon Musk is an overrated poseur who never actually contributed anything at Tesla or SpaceX are morons who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s legit a genius and a fantastic engineer. I\u2019ve talked to bona-fide, actual rocket engineers who\u2019ve met Musk and say he\u2019s the real deal. He was integrally involved in the design of the Raptor rocket engine. The folks who say Elon Musk is a boy wonder who is amazing at everything he does are morons who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Elon has the social skills of potato salad and a peculiar and singularly toxic blend of self-absorption, entitlement, and narcissism that legit make him a terrible person to work for. Like many smart people, he believes his first thought on any subject, even if it\u2019s completely outside his wheelhouse, is Revealed Truth\u2122. He\u2019s succeeded splendidly at a few things, so he thinks that makes him infallible at everything. All these things can be true at the same time. The need to think he\u2019s a poseur moron because you don\u2019t like him is stupid. The need to see him as some kind of infallible tech saint because he\u2019s done amazing things at SpaceX is stupid. The most important thing we can learn from Elon Musk? How to avoid simplistic cartoon thinking. Not by example\u2014simplistic cartoon thinking virtually defines his approach to the world\u2014but in the way we think about him."

However, one thing almost anyone who knows him agrees on is that he is a force to be reckoned with.

With his natural ability to train and recall large volumes of information he was able to use these books as a foundation to learn and understand more at a faster pace.  When he hired his first engineers he quizzed them non-stop about every single detail or every task they were completing, and the thinking behind each action. Many early engineers at SpaceX believed he was testing them but soon realized he was using them as a means of educating himself on the industry the science behind it. Combined with his hands on work ethic and nothing is impossible attitude he has become as knowledgable or even more so than his engineers and scientists throughout his tenure as CEO of SpaceX. So in short, it's a combination of self-education, his inquisitive nature, a natural ability to store and recall volumes of text, and good old fashioned experience. Nothing is impossible, and Elon Musk proves that  to the world and himself every single day. ",

I have read the book about Elon Musk, and furthermore a lot of online articles and information about the man, therefore I feel somewhat qualified to answer this.j Since Elon Musk was young, he could soak up information at a pace almost no one else could, he learned the entire programming language BASIC (or at least the course he had gotten when he was a child) in one night, while it was supposed to take 3 weeks. This is just a small example of how Elon Musk\u2019s genius memory works. When he wanted to go into the rocket business, he first tried to buy rockets from people (mostly Russian because they were cheaper) in order to go to execute his ideas of the Mars mission. Though this all seemed to expensive and he flew back to the United States with his companions. When they landed, he announced the idea of building the rocket himself, as he researched what parts were needed, calculated the costs in a spreadsheet, and came to the conclusion he could do it a lot cheaper than it was to buy a rocket. He showed this to his more experienced companion, and it seemed to be almost perfectly right. He then started trying to figure out how it actually worked so he read a lot of books about Rockets, and how the engineering worked, by this time he was becoming almost as knowledgable as your average engineer in about every significant area. When spaceX was launched, he hired some of the most talented college grads and also some more experienced engineers, which he started to build the rocket with. While on the working floor he would regularly ask an engineer to completely explain what he was doing, why he was doing it and every single piece of theory behind it, he would sometimes ask questions for hours. This, combined with the extreme pace and quality at which Elon Musk can absorb information and actually use it right away, makes him very qualified at almost every engineering discipline.",

Elon Musk, before starting SpaceX, wanted to discover how much a potential launch would cost, so he plotted a trip to Russia. Musk planned to buy a refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, from Russians and use that as his launch vehicle. For help, Elon reached out to Jim Cantrell, an individual accused of espionage and placed under house arrest in 1996 by the Russians\u2014so naturally, a fantastic choice. After unsuccessfully negotiating with the Russians, who treated Elon Musk like a little boy. Both Cantrell, Musk, and Griffin (another guy who Elon recruited to go to Russia with him) were feeling down as they were sitting on their plane for the flight home. When all of a sudden, Musk wheels around and flashes them a spreadsheet he\u2019d created. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d he said, \u201cI think we can build this rocket ourselves.\u201d Naturally, neither Griffin nor Cantrell thought Musk was being serious. Musk explains, however, that this spreadsheet detailed the costs of the materials needed to build, assemble, and launch a rocket. According to Musk\u2019s calculations, he could undercut existing launch companies by building a modest-sized rocket that would cater to a part of the market that specialized in carrying smaller satellites and research payloads to space. Cantrell asks, bewildered, \u201cElon, where did you get this?\u201d Musk had spent months studying the aerospace industry and the physics behind it. From Cantrell and others, he\u2019d borrowed \u201cRocket Propulsion Elements,\u201d \u201cFundamentals of Astrodynamics,\u201d and \u201cAerothermodynamics of Gas Turbine and Rocket Propulsion,\u201d along with several more seminal texts. Musk had reverted to his childhood state as a devourer of information and had emerged from this meditative process with the realization that rockets could and should be made cheaper than what the Russians were offering.So, to answer your question, he came to this epiphany about rockets through reading books and texts about rocket propulsion, etc. This is largely how he eventually had enough knowledge to start the company.

            "I personally feel what Elon Musk is doing is in a completely different dimension. In many ways (especially given the launch of Falcon 9 today), what Musk already accomplished put him in a level where he shouldn't be compared to anyone. Jobs changed how individuals live and interact in their daily lives. Musk is on a path to change how humanity will function as a whole. Both are very special individuals. While Jobs' impact was felt immediately within a span of a few years, I don't believe Musk's true legacy will be defined by anyone in our generations.",

I know how hard it is to build complex systems. I know how difficult it is to achieve commercial success in any industry. Elon Musk is the most fearless entrepreneur/visionary in history. Creating an electric car company was lunacy, especially so far away from Detroit, and he pulled it off, completely changing the trajectory of one of the largest and most complex industries on the planet. History will look back on the success of the Tesla Model S as a turning point in the technological development of the automobile (i.e. goodbye internal combustion engine). Like Steve Jobs, Musk is a product visionary, understanding how good a revolutionary new product (the Tesla Model S) needed to be for consumer acceptance and he was relentless at making it such; when it came out, Consumer Reports magazine said it may be the best car ever built. I\u2019ve owned two Teslas and I agree. And, simultaneously, why not start a private space company, an even crazier idea. How hard could it be to develop the AI to land a reusable booster rocket vertically on a floating platform smaller than a parking lot when NATION STATES have tried to do it and failed?

And in addition to that, he\u2019s socially awkward (have you ever seen him speak? He might be one of the most socially awkward people on the planet!), clueless, and almost unbelievably incompetent at social interaction. He appears to have severe problems with empathy, and appears unable to identify with or even recognize the personhood of other human beings. He treats other people as expendable in almost every social interaction. If the interviews with him are any indication, simple social cues are invisible to him and basic social interaction is completely unfathomable to him. Which makes him perfect to head a spacecraft design firm, but almost utterly incapable of managing, say, a social media company.",

They may not be inspirational to you. Inspiration is somewhat of a risk: it takes you outside the world you once knew and introduces you to a new thought, person, idea, or something totally unexpected.  So I wrote down the quotes and what I think I learned from them. Maybe as I think of them more I'll learn more. I don't know.  Here are the inspirational quotes from Elon Musk that stuck with me:  1. \u201cIf something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.\u201d I was thinking: what if it really is impossible.  But Elon Musk then takes it to the next level always: \"let's go to Mars\".  Or \"let's make a billion dollar battery factory.\" So at the very least it's always worth exploring the delicious curvature of the impossible.  2. \u201cGoing from PayPal, I thought: \u2018Well, what are some of the other problems that are likely to most affect the future of humanity?\u2019 Not from the perspective, \u2018What\u2019s the best way to make money?\u201d I've interviewed over 100 people now on my podcast. Each of the 100 have achieved amazing results in their life.  That's a subjective opinion. \"Amazing\" to me.  But none of them have done if for the money. I was talking to Coolio, for instance, who had the best selling song of 1995.  He started writing lyrics every day in 1977. It took him 17 years to have a single hit.  \"Never do something for the money,\" Coolio told me.  3. \u201c(Physics is) a good framework for thinking. \u2026 Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.\u201d My guess is he is not referring specifically to the science and theories of physics but the act of visualizing something, coming up with an idea or a theory of why it might be true, and then figuring out how to prove that theory.  To me, thats what physics is. Since the rules are constantly changing, which is another fascinating aspect of physics.  4. \u201cThe first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.\u201d I wonder about this. What's impossible? Maybe a time machine is too hard to figure out.  But to make an electric car you can imagine first a hybrid car that has a trunk filled with very efficient batteries so you don't ever need the gas part.  Then it becomes a function of probabilities versus possibilities.  5. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket.\u201d Many people think entrepreneurship is about risk. In fact, it's the opposite. Good entrepreneurs don't learn by failure (the popular \"failure porn\" all over the Internet). Good entrepreneurs learn by solving difficult problems.  Elon Musk controlled his outcome with X . com not by destroying the competitor but by merging with it (paypal).  6. \u201cPersistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up.\u201d I always think this is the magic equation:  persistence + love = abundance.  You have to love something enough to persist. You have to persist enough to deepen your love.  And then abundance is the natural outcome. Not just for you but for everyone. Since wealth comes to those who create wealth for others.  7. \u201cYou want to have a future where you\u2019re expecting things to be better, not one where you\u2019re expecting things to be worse.\u201d This is incredibly important. News reporters have zero qualifications to inform people and yet they are all doom and gloom to sell subscriptions.  But entrepreneurs are the ones who imagine a better world and how to make the leap to get there.  8. \u201cIt is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who don\u2019t know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive.\u201d When I was running a software company, we always knew it would take one great programmer to solve a hard problem in one night versus 10 mediocre programmers taking a month to screw up a problem even worse.  9. \u201cIf you go back a few hundred years, what we take for granted today would seem like magic \u2013 being able to talk to people over long distances, to transmit images, flying, accessing vast amounts of data like an oracle. These are all things that would have been considered magic a few hundred years ago.\u201d And now imagine what it will be like 300 years from now when people look back at today. \"They had to actually 'connect' to an Internet then!\" or \"It took them 7 hours to get from NY to CA!\"  10. \u201cMy biggest mistake is probably weighing too much on someone\u2019s talent and not someone\u2019s personality. I think it matters whether someone has a good heart.\u201d I recently watched a company go from a billion in revenues to zero when a founder stole $90 million from the company.  Integrity, humility, and doing your best is by far the most important consideration when evaluating whether to work for someone.  12. \u201cWhen I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world. Now I am.\u201d I always wonder about the phrase \"change the world\". Can one person change another.  Perhaps the most valuable starting point is to do everything I can to change myself each day: to be physically healthier, to be around emotionally healthy people ,to be create, to be grateful.  Then maybe I can have a head start on changing the world.  13. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to have a feedback loop, where you\u2019re constantly thinking about what you\u2019ve done and how you could be doing it better. I think that\u2019s the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.\u201d I'm invested in about 30 companies. The companies that fail are when CEOs smoke their own crack.  Technology, competition, customers are constantly changing. But we have a cognitive bias to think that the activity we have invested the most time in is, of course, a GREAT activity.  What could be wrong with it?  So it's important to constantly question this evolution-based cognitive bias with constant questioning as if one were an outsider looking in. Without that, businesses fail.  14. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I have a lack of fear. In fact, I\u2019d like my fear emotion to be less because it\u2019s very distracting and fries my nervous system.\u201d A small level of fear is motivational. It forces me to have a backup plan. The average multimillionaire supposedly has seven sources of income. They all have backup plans.  Even Elon Musk has Tesla, SpaceX, SolarCity, and probably a dozen other companies he's peripherally involved in.  Any endeavor I do, I always ask two questions: \"What is my plan B?\" and \"What is my evil plan?\" Meaning what do I hope to learn from this that nobody else expects 15. \u201cLife is too short for long-term grudges.\u201d I always think that I'm the average of the five people I spend the most time with.  So this quote is important to me. Don't spend time with people who can even incite a grudge. I try to spend time with the people I love and who love me. 16. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of new arenas.\u201d Again, inspiration is a risk. It means stepping out of the comfort zone where you've never been before.  I try as an exercise to figure out at least one thing a day to do that is outside my comfort zone.  One time I was talking to Noah Kagan and he suggested something simple: next time you go for coffee, ask for a 10% discount after they ring up your order.  This sounds trite compared with planning a ship to Mars but it really made me nervous when I tried it. It was good practice. Maybe next thing will be the trip to Mars.  17. \u201cI think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.\u201d I thought about this when I read it. I think it's ok for \"ordinary\" people to be ordinary also. Ordinary is beautiful.  But I think every day it's worth trying to be a little better (1%, an amount so small it can't be measured) in physical health, emotional health, creativity, and gratitude.  Maybe that is a path to extraordinary as that 1% compounds. But I don't want the pressure of \"future extraordinary\". I just want to be a little better today 18. \u201cI could either watch it happen or be a part of it.\u201d Sometimes people say to me, \"I missed the boat\" or \"I am too late\". I think it's never too late to do what you love.\" What you love is always on the shore, waiting for you to arrive, waiting with open arms. 19. \u201cBeing an Entrepreneur is like eating glass and staring into the abyss of death\u201d People say to me, \"I hate my cubicle. I want to be an entrepreneur.\"  Entrepreneurship is a disaster. 85% of entrepreneurs fail and failure is not fun at all. Not to mention you have to deal with customers, employees, investors - they are all your bosses and not the other way around.  Then you have to sell, you have to execute, you have to build, you have to exit, you have to grow.  I like Elon Musks's approach of having many things to work on. Many Plan Bs. So any one entrepreneurial endeavor doesn't take up all the mind space. 20. \"I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.\" I highly recomend Andy Weir's book, \"The Martian\". He self-published it. Then it got picked up by a major publisher. Now Ridley Scott doing the movie.  Discusses this very topic. 21. On his favorite book when he was a teen, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\": It taught me that the tough thing is figuring out what questions to ask, but that once you do that, the rest is really easy.\" Here's my favorite part of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: the idea that all you really need from a materialistic perspective is a towel.  Then the Universe sort of takes care of things after that. Hygiene is key 22. \"I just want to retire before I go senile because if I don't retire before I go senile, then I'll do more damage than good at that point.\" \"Retirement\" is an interesting word, invented by the actuaries who used statistics to come up with social security.  So I doubt Elon Musk will ever retire.  In fact, from a mortality perspective the two most dangerous years in life are the year you are born and the year you retire. ------So I never interviewed him. But maybe read and watched several dozen interviews and wrote down my favorite quotes.  Then I wrote what I learned from them. I want to learn from everyone. That's how I get inspired. If you don't agree with me, maybe you learned different things.  But I like these quotes and I hope this somewhat fits the answer.",

Elon Musk\u2019s army of rabid haterz are also a bunch of idiots. A lot of folks really struggle with nuance and complexity. They need people to be simple, black or white caricatures. A person must either be a hero or a villain, a savior or a schemer. The folks who say Elon Musk is an overrated poseur who never actually contributed anything at Tesla or SpaceX are morons who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. He\u2019s legit a genius and a fantastic engineer. I\u2019ve talked to bona-fide, actual rocket engineers who\u2019ve met Musk and say he\u2019s the real deal. He was integrally involved in the design of the Raptor rocket engine. The folks who say Elon Musk is a boy wonder who is amazing at everything he does are morons who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Elon has the social skills of potato salad and a peculiar and singularly toxic blend of self-absorption, entitlement, and narcissism that legit make him a terrible person to work for. Like many smart people, he believes his first thought on any subject, even if it\u2019s completely outside his wheelhouse, is Revealed Truth\u2122. He\u2019s succeeded splendidly at a few things, so he thinks that makes him infallible at everything. All these things can be true at the same time. The need to think he\u2019s a poseur moron because you don\u2019t like him is stupid. The need to see him as some kind of infallible tech saint because he\u2019s done amazing things at SpaceX is stupid. The most important thing we can learn from Elon Musk? How to avoid simplistic cartoon thinking. Not by example\u2014simplistic cartoon thinking virtually defines his approach to the world\u2014but in the way we think about him."

But I will be straight forward with you, there are five main reasons why you should reconsider your vote.Coherency Donald Trump appeals due to his outsider reputation. His inexperience is a main draw for people who don't want the same old politics. However, due to his inexperience, he has not really developed a true body of political beliefs. He often contradicts himself outside of his main tentpole items. And even then, he often retracts, changes or completely drops various things. His campaign also lacks coherency outside of his battle cry, \"Make America Great Again.\" There are promising things in his platform that absolutely make sense, I do admit. However, as he is often changing what his platform entails, so it is hard to say if that's what he'll do in office. This is often cited as a warning sign in potential dangerous candidates to the world at large. Bernie Sanders has been saying his message since the 80's. He has campaigned and worked for what he could-however, he is just one man and the right-shifting of the Democratic party defanged the hopes he had. However, he has found many ways to get what he feels should be done-done. He has worked across the aisle, with John McCain to clean up the VA and got the act he sponsored passed in the most inactive senate ever elected. You can read about the bill he passed here: How Bernie Sanders Fought for Our VeteransPopulism vs DemagogueryThere are distinct differences between classic Populism and demagoguery. Populism dates back to a party, The Populist Party which agitated for the plight of farmers, specifically western farmers and workers as a whole. While they never sent a president to the white house, their work enabled for such measures like the minimum wage act and for union busting to be a crime. These Populists listened to a population that was not currently being heard in the political process and provided a forum and means for their plights to be heard. Their ideological descendants are the Industrial Workers of the World union, Occupy Movement, #BlackLivesMatter and... Bernie Sanders. So why not Donald Trump?  Both men hold that the middle class and people in general are getting a bum deal. Mr. Sanders has the idea that it's a lack of fair play-that the rich get richer while the poor get poorer. It's not a new idea, in fact that is why Franklin Delano Roosevelt created his New Deal. (More on that below.) His ideal policies all flow from that. However, Mr. Trump bases his platform that foreigners are largely to blame. This isn't a new idea either. There has been a lot of pushback against immigrants and minorities since before the founding of the nation. He has decried illegal immigration and blamed muslims for the problems the United States faces. However, Mr. Trump's solutions are not ideal. Mass deportation would be the most expensive undertaking in the history of United States bureaucracy. It would cost already burdened budgets billions, if not trillions of dollars. The wall idea is more of the same. Unless he were to rely on cheap, illegal labor, his wall would cost hundreds of billions of dollars-of which, Mexico is vanishingly unliikely. The man has proposed many human rights violations, including the torture of innocent persons whose only crime was that their relative committed a crime. Guilty by association has no place in rule of law.Foreign Relations Mr. Sanders is known as a peacemaker. His eyes are always on the ball and he is known as the Amendment King for a reason. He can make bridges between two people who deeply disagree on matters. He is however, not one to back down easily. Obama may say \"Don't do stupid stuff\" but he will also cut down on the disasterous stupid decisions of the past. Many Europeans like him, as his opinions are more like their centrists. Mr. Trump is an antagonistic man. He pushes, prods, makes melodramatic gestures and doesn't care who he angers. He's often rash in anger and often talks about revenge. That's not someone we need in the White House. Scotland debated barring him from entry if he should carry the day in the elections. His overtures of supporting torture, even on innocent persons would alienate many allies, especially our oldest: Muslim nation, Morocco. Our oldest unbroken treaty is with this nation. They were the first to recognize the colonies as their own country and provided needed supplies. It was not the French, as is often taught in schools, though they also provided supplies and men much needed. He is recognized as a high-danger to world security because his opinions veer very far right to the Europeans, to the point of radicalism. There is much fear of him, but it is a fear ready to act. Is that a way to make America stronger? To alienate our country?Civil Rights in regards to Religion or National Origin Speaking of Muslims. Donald Trump planned at least at one point to deport all Muslims. Doesn't matter their status, even people born here. It would be a fiasco and incredibly contrary to the ideals of the Constitution. To make things clear, his plans to torture and imprison even innocent families of terrorists defies rule of law. It's deeply bigoted and deeply worrying to our many freedoms, primarily freedom of speech and religion. Our forefathers founded this nation as a secular one. Many of the framers of the constitution were Deists, who did not believe in the bible but wished for anyone to believe what they wished in America and not repeat the same mistakes of England and Europe. Mr. Trump's beliefs align most clearly with jingoism, like that which the Klu Klux Klan espouse.Solutions Proposed to Job ShortagesOf our candidates, only two have spoken at length about the real job shortages and the destruction of our manufacturing power. Those jobs may never come back. The plans for both candidates vary extremely. Mr. Trump believes that illegal immigration and that guest workers take up American jobs. He's not wrong-but what he misses is that many immigrants take jobs that average Americans turn their noses up at, like janitorial jobs and highly manual labor work. He wants to deport all illegal immigrants and stop a type of guest worker visas that are often abused. It is unlikely to work, however as it fails to address the other aspects of job flight-not simply globalization but the march of progress. Robots do many jobs humans used to, for much cheaper rates.Mr. Sanders also wishes to stop a type of guest worker visa that is often abused, but he wishes to invest in infrastructure and universities, creating new skilled workers that are actually in demand. A high school diploma or GED is no longer enough. He also espouses a stop on trade agreements, like NAFTA and others that hurt workers and send jobs overseas. The investments in infrastructure, universities and single-payer healthcare (which both candidates support) means a more educated (therefore desirable) and healthy workforce to meet the needs of rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We were once the envy of the world with our rails. There is much that can be done and should be done, especially in light of the Flint Water Crisis. (Water is considered an infrastructure.)All in all, it is up to you and your right to vote how you please. Even if you vote for Commander Cobra of Hydra. I just hope that when it comes time, you will be able to make an informed decision as a voter. While I personally hope for a Sanders vote, the decision is yours and yours alone.That is your right as an American.",

I base them off that person's political leanings, not my own, meaning that even as a Bernie supporter I have suggested a couple of other candidates for some people in this election cycle. The process is important to me, and I refuse to knowingly mislead people or lie to them to get their vote. I try to convince people to vote for Bernie because I feel he'd be a great President. His policies would seriously rebuild the middle class, put the brakes on out-of-control financial services, and usher in a new wave of entrepreneurial spirit while reducing major costs on our families, our communities and our country. He'd avoid self-defeating, pointless and expensive wars\u2014meaning the majority of them\u2014and use diplomacy first. He'd continue treating our veterans with respect and care, he'd get some smart liberal people on the benches in the courts, and he'd build a culture of respect. And unlike some other candidates, he's chosen right the first time when it mattered, like NAFTA and the Iraq debacle and TPP, and I expect he can do that when faced with new situations as well. No, it's not that you should vote for Bernie Sanders. But I hope you'll want to, and I hope you will. Edit, May 4 2019: I finally caught the typo above from when I wrote this in 2016 and gave a very minor update to some em-dashes. I can be a little obsessive about my typos and punctuation. While I would otherwise describe myself now as a strong Bernie supporter instead of a die-hard one, the rest of it still stands.",

His policies would seriously rebuild the middle class, put the brakes on out-of-control financial services, and usher in a new wave of entrepreneurial spirit while reducing major costs on our families, our communities and our country. He'd avoid self-defeating, pointless and expensive wars\u2014meaning the majority of them\u2014and use diplomacy first. He'd continue treating our veterans with respect and care, he'd get some smart liberal people on the benches in the courts, and he'd build a culture of respect. And unlike some other candidates, he's chosen right the first time when it mattered, like NAFTA and the Iraq debacle and TPP, and I expect he can do that when faced with new situations as well. No, it's not that you should vote for Bernie Sanders. But I hope you'll want to, and I hope you will. Edit, May 4 2019: I finally caught the typo above from when I wrote this in 2016 and gave a very minor update to some em-dashes. I can be a little obsessive about my typos and punctuation.

This means it\u2019s possible for a Republican candidate with a deficit of 2\u20134 percentage points to win the presidency.The election will be decided in about 10 so-called swing states. And in these states, Biden\u2019s lead is smaller than it is nationally.[1]We have almost 2 months to go to election day. There are still things that could swing things in Trump\u2019s favor.The above was just one poll, albeit a very high-quality one. Let\u2019s zoom in a bit on the swing states where Biden is leading: North Carolina:This is essentially a tie. Florida:This is also basically a tie. Latinos in Florida are more conservative than elsewhere in the country. And Trump has been making inroads in the traditional Democratic stronghold of Miami-Dade county.[2] Arizona:To the surprise of many, this state seems to be in play this year. Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t foolish to campaign there in 2016. She was seeing something. In any case, Biden\u2019s lead is small, but it has been fairly consistent. At this point, he\u2019s got about a 2:1 chance of winning it. Pennsylvania:I\u2019m sure Biden would prefer to have a bigger lead, but 4.5% is pretty decent. One should remember that it doesn\u2019t take much for polls to be off when the margin is too narrow. Overestimate Democratic turnout by 2%, underestimate Republican by 2%, and you\u2019re basically there. What is encouraging for Biden is that his numbers have consistently been north of 50%. Wisconsin:Looking pretty blue this year. It\u2019s still possible for Trump to win races like this, but it\u2019s unlikely. This state actually pretty closely mirror\u2019s Trump\u2019s chances of winning nationally. New Hampshire:Not a blowout, but pretty darn consistent. Nevada:Not impossible for Trump, but if he\u2019s winning here on election day, he\u2019s probably winning in PA and WI. Minnesota:A long shot for Trump, but still possible. Chances of Trump winning are about 1:6. Michigan:I\u2019m going to make a bold prediction: Trump is not going to win Michigan this time. There were extenuating circumstances in 2016, with an unpopular Democratic nominee and a complacent Democratic electorate, that are not going to be replicated this year. Biden has a greater chance of winning Texas than Trump does of winning Michigan this year.With all that said, let\u2019s look at Trump\u2019s overall chances of victory. They have oscillated between 20 and 30%. It\u2019s not the position he wishes he were in, but I wouldn\u2019t entirely write him off.A 1:4 chance of winning is very different from a 1:10 chance. We might start heading closer to the latter probability if these numbers remain the same over the next 4 weeks, but we\u2019re not there yet. There will be October surprises on both sides. We might end up with a narrower race than we\u2019ve seen over the past 3 months. Of course, the reverse is also possible. Trump could go from the 46% of the electorate he is expecting to capture to something like 42%. That would be insurmountable. With this long explication out of the way, let\u2019s return to the question at hand: will Trump win reelection? It\u2019s less likely than the alternative, but it\u2019s far from impossible\u2026 for now.Footnotes[1] Trump Onslaught Against Biden Falls Short of a Breakthrough[2] \u2018What do we do?\u2019: Trump gains rattle Miami Dems",

My Facebook friends have blamed each one of these groups in the past few hours. In fact, there is no proof that the third party candidates took votes from Clinton. It is more likely for them to have taken from Trump, where even many traditional republicans openly stood against. Even George Bush didn\u2019t vote for his party candidate [Trump thinks 'it's sad' George W Bush voted 'None of the Above']. That means Trump was able to find a voice far bigger than even the Republican party. The white women vote was nearly split even. That after all the revelations about Trump\u2019s uncharitable comments. Surely, not all those of the women were misogynists. Something must have troubled them far more to go to the polls & vote for Trump, keeping down their disgust. Same with the Hispanics who voted more with the Republicans than in the recent times. That after his statements about the wall. Surely, something bigger must have been there to keep down their inhibitions on racism.This is part of the common people\u2019s revolution against the establishment. They don\u2019t trust their politicians. Their media. Their diplomats. Their administrators. They felt let down by their economists. They fear about their jobs and culture. They fear something existential issue about their way of life. And when people have existential fears, they suppress all other inhibitions. The more the media talked about Trump\u2019s failures, the more it looked like the establishment colluding. It was as though everyone was conspiring against Trump. To defeat that establishment was more important for many than their own inhibitions on gender and race issues. And it completely didn\u2019t matter that Trump was unrefined, uninformed and politically wrong. In fact, those are the precise things that made him anti-establishment. His blathering about nuclear triad and other topics, rather than harming him actually helped him. People saw him as an ordinary Joe and the Joes don\u2019t go well prepared in public talking. People saw that as honest and down to earth in the same way as they saw GW Bush. In contrast HRC was super well rehearsed - almost to the level of a robot. People didn\u2019t care about what she said, but just noted the way she said it. That reminded them of the establishment - a scheming individual. And more the media talked about HRC\u2019s virtues and Trump\u2019s uncouthness, more the people saw a need to back Trump. It was their fight against the elite. And my liberal friends had no idea that they were in an echo chamber. They completely tuned out anything they find deplorable.This revolution is hardly limited to the US. It is happening across the world. In Arab Spring, many of the established governments were toppled in the Middle East. In Brexit, the British voters middle fingered all the mainstream parties. In Philippines, the new President is completely fingering US and going straight with his executions of drug addicts. In India and Indonesia, the voters elevated promising provincial chiefs to premiers in 2014, both of whom coming from poor backgrounds. And it is just the beginning. Across Europe and elsewhere in the world changes are happening to the post-WW2 coalitions and political arrangements. Everywhere, there is an anger against the establishment. Anger against the status quo. Like in the late 18th century, this is the worst time to be a part of the elite. People around the world have gotten existential worries about their culture, economic status and the ability to continue their way of life. For them it looks like the liberals are pushing the reforms way too fast and without paying heed to their opinions. As the liberals tar them as being outdated, racists and uneducated [and as Hillary mentioned deplorables], the angry commoners often mask their anger and don\u2019t reveal enough of their preferences in public [not a single person on my FB feed supported Trump even though I know many secretly support him]. This is why the opinion polls don\u2019t reveal the complete picture. Also, many liberals measure public opinion through media and completely miss the fire building up underneath. As the liberals brush aside these concerns and don\u2019t try to address them, these voters stop trusting anything to do with the former. Historically, people have fought the hardest when their way of life is threatened. Liberals for all their alleged grasp of history, failed to go beyond endlessly quoting the 1932 elections in the Weimar republic, and failed to see the history of revolutions and civil wars. As the words Fascism and Nazism got thrown too easily, the shock value completely evaporated. If every right wing leader was Hitler, then there was nothing special or shocking about getting branded as Hitler. If the previous Hitlers around the world didn\u2019t end the world, why would this new Hitler?Ultimately, it is an anger that existed for a long time and in hindsight it is not hard to see a Trump victory. He won way many states that were thought to be solidly democrat. He won far more Hispanic votes than Mitt Romney. And he won a sizable chunk of the immigrants and more surprisingly a sizable chunk of the females. So much for all the buzzfeed worthy charts posted by Nate Silver. Trump won despite his embarrassing revelations about women and despite the Republican leadership quitting on him. That should show the level of anger underneath. This anger is not all from racists, white supremacists and misogynists, KKK supporters, etc. Revolutions often turn up leaders who are far worse than the establishment they toppled. But, they also help heal things over the long run. In a way this is good for the US. Like a pressure cooker releasing pressure, this is an election to let out that built-up pressure & anger in a less violent way. Hopefully this is an election that will let both sides see the other\u2019s point. The \u201cus vs them\u201d attitude and the uncharitable attitudes of the other side has to end.",

This utter dismissal of rural America in favor of playing solely to an urban, elite base was dumb, dumb, dumb.Speaking of that rural America, a lot of America has NOT seen their fortunes improve during the Obama administration. Hillary NEVER talked to those people. Trump did. Trump was the only candidate who did. Utterly abandoning a large number of electoral votes is a bad strategy. It\u2019s the sort of political division that\u2019s really bad for the country.Democrats, fresh off some social issue victories, doubled down on political correctness. And it turned into arrogance. The Bathroom wars, safe spaces, trigger warnings, cultural appropriation? All of this hurt Democrats, for dubious gain. Creepy guys using women\u2019s restrooms isn\u2019t a winning political position. Again, this should be patently obvious. Yet Democrats were blinded by a bright LGBT star, and failed to see the argument of their opposition.This election in many ways is a referendum on the ruling class, the political elite, the establishment. Lots of people wanted and demanded change. The early waves of this movement helped Obama win the White House. This is a continuation of that trend.I was stunned as the results flowed in last night. But at DNC headquarters, there should be panic. If Trump did this to you, what would a slightly less controversial candidate have done?"

Why not an overwhelming favorite? 3 reasons:The electoral college favors Republicans at this point in our history. This means it\u2019s possible for a Republican candidate with a deficit of 2\u20134 percentage points to win the presidency.The election will be decided in about 10 so-called swing states. And in these states, Biden\u2019s lead is smaller than it is nationally.[1]We have almost 2 months to go to election day. There are still things that could swing things in Trump\u2019s favor.The above was just one poll, albeit a very high-quality one. Let\u2019s zoom in a bit on the swing states where Biden is leading: North Carolina:This is essentially a tie. Florida:This is also basically a tie. Latinos in Florida are more conservative than elsewhere in the country. And Trump has been making inroads in the traditional Democratic stronghold of Miami-Dade county.[2] Arizona:To the surprise of many, this state seems to be in play this year. Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t foolish to campaign there in 2016. She was seeing something. In any case, Biden\u2019s lead is small, but it has been fairly consistent. At this point, he\u2019s got about a 2:1 chance of winning it. Pennsylvania:I\u2019m sure Biden would prefer to have a bigger lead, but 4.5% is pretty decent. One should remember that it doesn\u2019t take much for polls to be off when the margin is too narrow. Overestimate Democratic turnout by 2%, underestimate Republican by 2%, and you\u2019re basically there. What is encouraging for Biden is that his numbers have consistently been north of 50%. Wisconsin:Looking pretty blue this year. It\u2019s still possible for Trump to win races like this, but it\u2019s unlikely. This state actually pretty closely mirror\u2019s Trump\u2019s chances of winning nationally. New Hampshire:Not a blowout, but pretty darn consistent. Nevada:Not impossible for Trump, but if he\u2019s winning here on election day, he\u2019s probably winning in PA and WI. Minnesota:A long shot for Trump, but still possible. Chances of Trump winning are about 1:6. Michigan:I\u2019m going to make a bold prediction: Trump is not going to win Michigan this time. There were extenuating circumstances in 2016, with an unpopular Democratic nominee and a complacent Democratic electorate, that are not going to be replicated this year. Biden has a greater chance of winning Texas than Trump does of winning Michigan this year.With all that said, let\u2019s look at Trump\u2019s overall chances of victory. They have oscillated between 20 and 30%. It\u2019s not the position he wishes he were in, but I wouldn\u2019t entirely write him off.A 1:4 chance of winning is very different from a 1:10 chance. We might start heading closer to the latter probability if these numbers remain the same over the next 4 weeks, but we\u2019re not there yet. There will be October surprises on both sides. We might end up with a narrower race than we\u2019ve seen over the past 3 months. Of course, the reverse is also possible. Trump could go from the 46% of the electorate he is expecting to capture to something like 42%. That would be insurmountable. With this long explication out of the way, let\u2019s return to the question at hand: will Trump win reelection? It\u2019s less likely than the alternative, but it\u2019s far from impossible\u2026 for now.Footnotes[1] Trump Onslaught Against Biden Falls Short of a Breakthrough[2] \u2018What do we do?\u2019: Trump gains rattle Miami Dems",

My Facebook friends have blamed each one of these groups in the past few hours. In fact, there is no proof that the third party candidates took votes from Clinton. It is more likely for them to have taken from Trump, where even many traditional republicans openly stood against. Even George Bush didn\u2019t vote for his party candidate [Trump thinks 'it's sad' George W Bush voted 'None of the Above']. That means Trump was able to find a voice far bigger than even the Republican party. The white women vote was nearly split even. That after all the revelations about Trump\u2019s uncharitable comments. Surely, not all those of the women were misogynists. Something must have troubled them far more to go to the polls & vote for Trump, keeping down their disgust. Same with the Hispanics who voted more with the Republicans than in the recent times. That after his statements about the wall. Surely, something bigger must have been there to keep down their inhibitions on racism.This is part of the common people\u2019s revolution against the establishment. They don\u2019t trust their politicians. Their media. Their diplomats. Their administrators. They felt let down by their economists. They fear about their jobs and culture. They fear something existential issue about their way of life. And when people have existential fears, they suppress all other inhibitions. The more the media talked about Trump\u2019s failures, the more it looked like the establishment colluding. It was as though everyone was conspiring against Trump. To defeat that establishment was more important for many than their own inhibitions on gender and race issues. And it completely didn\u2019t matter that Trump was unrefined, uninformed and politically wrong. In fact, those are the precise things that made him anti-establishment. His blathering about nuclear triad and other topics, rather than harming him actually helped him. People saw him as an ordinary Joe and the Joes don\u2019t go well prepared in public talking. People saw that as honest and down to earth in the same way as they saw GW Bush. In contrast HRC was super well rehearsed - almost to the level of a robot. People didn\u2019t care about what she said, but just noted the way she said it. That reminded them of the establishment - a scheming individual. And more the media talked about HRC\u2019s virtues and Trump\u2019s uncouthness, more the people saw a need to back Trump. It was their fight against the elite. And my liberal friends had no idea that they were in an echo chamber. They completely tuned out anything they find deplorable.This revolution is hardly limited to the US. It is happening across the world. In Arab Spring, many of the established governments were toppled in the Middle East. In Brexit, the British voters middle fingered all the mainstream parties. In Philippines, the new President is completely fingering US and going straight with his executions of drug addicts. In India and Indonesia, the voters elevated promising provincial chiefs to premiers in 2014, both of whom coming from poor backgrounds. And it is just the beginning. Across Europe and elsewhere in the world changes are happening to the post-WW2 coalitions and political arrangements. Everywhere, there is an anger against the establishment. Anger against the status quo. Like in the late 18th century, this is the worst time to be a part of the elite. People around the world have gotten existential worries about their culture, economic status and the ability to continue their way of life. For them it looks like the liberals are pushing the reforms way too fast and without paying heed to their opinions. As the liberals tar them as being outdated, racists and uneducated [and as Hillary mentioned deplorables], the angry commoners often mask their anger and don\u2019t reveal enough of their preferences in public [not a single person on my FB feed supported Trump even though I know many secretly support him]. This is why the opinion polls don\u2019t reveal the complete picture. Also, many liberals measure public opinion through media and completely miss the fire building up underneath. As the liberals brush aside these concerns and don\u2019t try to address them, these voters stop trusting anything to do with the former. Historically, people have fought the hardest when their way of life is threatened. Liberals for all their alleged grasp of history, failed to go beyond endlessly quoting the 1932 elections in the Weimar republic, and failed to see the history of revolutions and civil wars. As the words Fascism and Nazism got thrown too easily, the shock value completely evaporated. If every right wing leader was Hitler, then there was nothing special or shocking about getting branded as Hitler. If the previous Hitlers around the world didn\u2019t end the world, why would this new Hitler?Ultimately, it is an anger that existed for a long time and in hindsight it is not hard to see a Trump victory. He won way many states that were thought to be solidly democrat. He won far more Hispanic votes than Mitt Romney. And he won a sizable chunk of the immigrants and more surprisingly a sizable chunk of the females. So much for all the buzzfeed worthy charts posted by Nate Silver. Trump won despite his embarrassing revelations about women and despite the Republican leadership quitting on him. That should show the level of anger underneath. This anger is not all from racists, white supremacists and misogynists, KKK supporters, etc. Revolutions often turn up leaders who are far worse than the establishment they toppled. But, they also help heal things over the long run. In a way this is good for the US. Like a pressure cooker releasing pressure, this is an election to let out that built-up pressure & anger in a less violent way. Hopefully this is an election that will let both sides see the other\u2019s point. The \u201cus vs them\u201d attitude and the uncharitable attitudes of the other side has to end.",

Somehow, this basic fact was ignored by the Democratic establishment, to the bitter end. I said 8 years ago that one person could unite the Republican party, and her name was Hillary Clinton. The failure of Democrats to have a real primary, but simply coronate their prior first loser was a stupid decision. And frankly, it was an obviously stupid one.Democrats (and establishment Republicans) treated vast swaths of the American electorate with something between contempt and outright hostility. That America voted for Trump. Strongly. If I was in the DNC headquarters, I would send a memo out saying that the next person to say \u201cflyover country\u201d will be fired. This utter dismissal of rural America in favor of playing solely to an urban, elite base was dumb, dumb, dumb.Speaking of that rural America, a lot of America has NOT seen their fortunes improve during the Obama administration. Hillary NEVER talked to those people. Trump did. Trump was the only candidate who did. Utterly abandoning a large number of electoral votes is a bad strategy. It\u2019s the sort of political division that\u2019s really bad for the country.Democrats, fresh off some social issue victories, doubled down on political correctness. And it turned into arrogance. The Bathroom wars, safe spaces, trigger warnings, cultural appropriation? All of this hurt Democrats, for dubious gain. Creepy guys using women\u2019s restrooms isn\u2019t a winning political position. Again, this should be patently obvious. Yet Democrats were blinded by a bright LGBT star, and failed to see the argument of their opposition.This election in many ways is a referendum on the ruling class, the political elite, the establishment. Lots of people wanted and demanded change. The early waves of this movement helped Obama win the White House. This is a continuation of that trend.I was stunned as the results flowed in last night. But at DNC headquarters, there should be panic. If Trump did this to you, what would a slightly less controversial candidate have done?"

I\u2019m surprised that even after the results staring so much in the face, some are in denial - blaming the third parties, blaming the \u201cfence sitters\u201d, blaming the people who didn\u2019t turn up, blaming the blacks for turning out enough, blaming the white females and so on. My Facebook friends have blamed each one of these groups in the past few hours. In fact, there is no proof that the third party candidates took votes from Clinton. It is more likely for them to have taken from Trump, where even many traditional republicans openly stood against. Even George Bush didn\u2019t vote for his party candidate [Trump thinks 'it's sad' George W Bush voted 'None of the Above']. That means Trump was able to find a voice far bigger than even the Republican party. The white women vote was nearly split even. That after all the revelations about Trump\u2019s uncharitable comments. Surely, not all those of the women were misogynists. Something must have troubled them far more to go to the polls & vote for Trump, keeping down their disgust. Same with the Hispanics who voted more with the Republicans than in the recent times. That after his statements about the wall. Surely, something bigger must have been there to keep down their inhibitions on racism.This is part of the common people\u2019s revolution against the establishment. They don\u2019t trust their politicians. Their media. Their diplomats. Their administrators. They felt let down by their economists. They fear about their jobs and culture. They fear something existential issue about their way of life. And when people have existential fears, they suppress all other inhibitions. The more the media talked about Trump\u2019s failures, the more it looked like the establishment colluding. It was as though everyone was conspiring against Trump. To defeat that establishment was more important for many than their own inhibitions on gender and race issues. And it completely didn\u2019t matter that Trump was unrefined, uninformed and politically wrong. In fact, those are the precise things that made him anti-establishment. His blathering about nuclear triad and other topics, rather than harming him actually helped him. People saw him as an ordinary Joe and the Joes don\u2019t go well prepared in public talking. People saw that as honest and down to earth in the same way as they saw GW Bush. In contrast HRC was super well rehearsed - almost to the level of a robot. People didn\u2019t care about what she said, but just noted the way she said it. That reminded them of the establishment - a scheming individual. And more the media talked about HRC\u2019s virtues and Trump\u2019s uncouthness, more the people saw a need to back Trump. It was their fight against the elite. And my liberal friends had no idea that they were in an echo chamber. They completely tuned out anything they find deplorable.This revolution is hardly limited to the US. It is happening across the world. In Arab Spring, many of the established governments were toppled in the Middle East. In Brexit, the British voters middle fingered all the mainstream parties. In Philippines, the new President is completely fingering US and going straight with his executions of drug addicts. In India and Indonesia, the voters elevated promising provincial chiefs to premiers in 2014, both of whom coming from poor backgrounds. And it is just the beginning. Across Europe and elsewhere in the world changes are happening to the post-WW2 coalitions and political arrangements. Everywhere, there is an anger against the establishment. Anger against the status quo. Like in the late 18th century, this is the worst time to be a part of the elite. People around the world have gotten existential worries about their culture, economic status and the ability to continue their way of life. For them it looks like the liberals are pushing the reforms way too fast and without paying heed to their opinions. As the liberals tar them as being outdated, racists and uneducated [and as Hillary mentioned deplorables], the angry commoners often mask their anger and don\u2019t reveal enough of their preferences in public [not a single person on my FB feed supported Trump even though I know many secretly support him]. This is why the opinion polls don\u2019t reveal the complete picture. Also, many liberals measure public opinion through media and completely miss the fire building up underneath. As the liberals brush aside these concerns and don\u2019t try to address them, these voters stop trusting anything to do with the former. Historically, people have fought the hardest when their way of life is threatened. Liberals for all their alleged grasp of history, failed to go beyond endlessly quoting the 1932 elections in the Weimar republic, and failed to see the history of revolutions and civil wars. As the words Fascism and Nazism got thrown too easily, the shock value completely evaporated. If every right wing leader was Hitler, then there was nothing special or shocking about getting branded as Hitler. If the previous Hitlers around the world didn\u2019t end the world, why would this new Hitler?Ultimately, it is an anger that existed for a long time and in hindsight it is not hard to see a Trump victory. He won way many states that were thought to be solidly democrat. He won far more Hispanic votes than Mitt Romney. And he won a sizable chunk of the immigrants and more surprisingly a sizable chunk of the females. So much for all the buzzfeed worthy charts posted by Nate Silver. Trump won despite his embarrassing revelations about women and despite the Republican leadership quitting on him. That should show the level of anger underneath. This anger is not all from racists, white supremacists and misogynists, KKK supporters, etc. Revolutions often turn up leaders who are far worse than the establishment they toppled. But, they also help heal things over the long run. In a way this is good for the US. Like a pressure cooker releasing pressure, this is an election to let out that built-up pressure & anger in a less violent way. Hopefully this is an election that will let both sides see the other\u2019s point. The \u201cus vs them\u201d attitude and the uncharitable attitudes of the other side has to end.",

Somehow, this basic fact was ignored by the Democratic establishment, to the bitter end. I said 8 years ago that one person could unite the Republican party, and her name was Hillary Clinton. The failure of Democrats to have a real primary, but simply coronate their prior first loser was a stupid decision. And frankly, it was an obviously stupid one.Democrats (and establishment Republicans) treated vast swaths of the American electorate with something between contempt and outright hostility. That America voted for Trump. Strongly. If I was in the DNC headquarters, I would send a memo out saying that the next person to say \u201cflyover country\u201d will be fired. This utter dismissal of rural America in favor of playing solely to an urban, elite base was dumb, dumb, dumb.Speaking of that rural America, a lot of America has NOT seen their fortunes improve during the Obama administration. Hillary NEVER talked to those people. Trump did. Trump was the only candidate who did. Utterly abandoning a large number of electoral votes is a bad strategy. It\u2019s the sort of political division that\u2019s really bad for the country.Democrats, fresh off some social issue victories, doubled down on political correctness. And it turned into arrogance. The Bathroom wars, safe spaces, trigger warnings, cultural appropriation? All of this hurt Democrats, for dubious gain. Creepy guys using women\u2019s restrooms isn\u2019t a winning political position. Again, this should be patently obvious. Yet Democrats were blinded by a bright LGBT star, and failed to see the argument of their opposition.This election in many ways is a referendum on the ruling class, the political elite, the establishment. Lots of people wanted and demanded change. The early waves of this movement helped Obama win the White House. This is a continuation of that trend.I was stunned as the results flowed in last night. But at DNC headquarters, there should be panic. If Trump did this to you, what would a slightly less controversial candidate have done?"

Your jerk reaction will be  that Jobs is a little overboard, but that attention to detail is what has made Apple the most profitable company in the world. Here is the story: One Sunday morning, January 6th, 2008 I was attending religious services when my cell phone vibrated. As discreetly as possible, I checked the phone and noticed that my phone said \u201cCaller ID unknown.\u201d I choose to ignore. After services, as I was walking to my car with my family, I checked my cell phone messages. The message left was from Steve Jobs. \u201cVic, can you call me at home? I have something urgent to discuss\u201d it said.   Before I even reached my car, I called Steve Jobs back. I was responsible for all mobile applications at Google, and in that role, had regular dealings with Steve. It was one of the perks of the job.   \u201cHey Steve \u2013 this is Vic\u201d, I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t answer your call earlier. I was in religious services, and the caller ID said unknown, so I didn\u2019t pick up\u201d.   Steve laughed. He said, \u201cVic, unless the Caller ID said \u2018GOD\u2019, you should never pick up during services.\u201d  I laughed nervously. After all, while it was customary for Steve to call during the week upset about something, it was unusual for him to call me on Sunday and ask me to call his home. I wondered what was so important? \u201cSo Vic, we have an urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away. I\u2019ve already assigned someone from my team to help you, and I hope you can fix this tomorrow\u201d said Steve.  \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at the Google logo on the iPhone and I\u2019m not happy with the icon. The second O in Google doesn\u2019t have the right yellow gradient. It\u2019s just wrong and I\u2019m going to have Greg fix it tomorrow. Is that okay with you?\u201d  Of course this was okay with me. A few minutes later on that Sunday I received an email from Steve with the subject \u201cIcon Ambulance\u201d. The email directed me to work with Greg Christie to fix the icon.   Since I was 11 years old and fell in love with an Apple II, I have dozens of stories to tell about Apple products. They have been a part of my life for decades. Even when I worked for 15 years for Bill Gates at Microsoft, I had a huge admiration for Steve and what Apple had produced.   But in the end, when I think about leadership, passion and attention to detail, I think back to the call I received from Steve Jobs on a Sunday morning in January. It was a lesson I\u2019ll never forget. CEOs should care about details. Even shades of yellow. On a Sunday.

It was a rough time in her life and she was very depressed by it, even though chemotherapy was healing her over time. Rebecca was a big fan of Pixar films. I knew Steve Jobs had also been battling cancer and was a big part of the Pixar company. I didn\u2019t know a lot about the guy at this time as it was before the rise of the iPod, iPhone, or iPad. I also wasn\u2019t the thorough nerd that I am now. Yes, there was a time I didn\u2019t care about technology. I sent a letter to Steve Jobs telling him about Rebecca and her situation. I asked for an autograph for her, hoping that could be something positive for her and encourage some positivity. I never thought I would get a reply, but I thought it was worth a try. A week later I receive a package in the mail. In this thick envelope was a letter from Steve Jobs speaking of his cancer fight and how he wished Rebecca a quick recovery. Also in this envelope was six Pixar prints signed by John Lasseter (director), Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft (a fellow cancer sufferer). Each of these men had written a letter to Rebecca wishing her well. Jobs did not have to go to this kind of trouble, but he did anyway. Steve Jobs was not a man known for his public charity and many people think he was driven by selfishness and greed. But this act goes against that idea for me. This was most certainly a positive, selfless, and charitable act. Joe Ranft passed away in a horrible car crash a few years ago and Jobs died today. This story is how I will remember Steve Jobs. Not for the technological advances he promoted. Not for the leaps and bounds that he funded. Not for the boundaries pushed. Of course our world would not be as advanced as it is now without him. Without Jobs we would not have personal computers in almost every home. We wouldn\u2019t have intuitive personal tech devices. Sure, other companies came up with the technology, but Apple made it easy. I was blown away by this when it happened. Rebecca treasured these letters and autographs and they infused positivity into her life. Eventually Rebecca recovered through chemo and radiotherapy. I don\u2019t know if she even remembers getting this package (she was never much of a movie freak as me), but I know she has the letters somewhere. I know they meant something at the time. I know they mean something to me now.",

It was hard to concentrate on whatever mundane conversation I was having when there sat a man with so much vision and wisdom that I wanted to learn from, just one table away. So I listened, and remember hearing him say: I wish I could be a fly on the wall in 100 years to see what technology is like.That sentence stuck with me for a long time. To me it symbolizes the type of long term thinking and resolve necessary to build an entity (company, organization, ideals, etc) that is decades old. To create something that lives on for centuries and finds ways to impact our world in profound ways. Our incremental thinking in entrepreneurship must be balanced with a long term world view of what society should be like.",

Twice I have fallen victim to someone mass reporting my answers because they don't like me.A follower of mine got mass reported around the same time I did, and unfortunately got banned. He's a nice guy, but for some reason someone doesn't like him.Catfish GaloreQuorans like me and a few others have found so many fake profiles, it's insane. The number one popular catfishing is pretending to be a gorgeous woman. However, men are extremely gullible and don't even bother to do a reverse image search. If you want followers and views bad enough, pretend to be a beautiful woman. For example, you will come across someone on here using Marina Mui's photos. However, she goes by a different name. What's insane is Quora won't do a thing about it, as there's no option to report a fake identity. Only a fake name.(Marina Mui)Naked womenI admit there have been a few times where I posted photos of myself, but here's the thing. While Quora is supposedly a place for knowledge, you'll come across questions asking to see certain parts of the female body. If you have very low confidence in your appearance like I do, this can pose a problem. All these women are skinny with perky breasts, and it'll make you feel bad. I ended up self-harming a few times because of them. As for the men commenting, it makes me feel so much worse. So, what will you do?Take the blue pill, your story ends on Quora and you'll be saved. Take the red pill, you'll see just how far the rabbit hole goes here. Unfortunately I'm in too far, so I don't have the opportunity you do.",

But the text\u2019s all me.) Consider staying back.The homepage, for someone new, can be a pretty overwhelming place. I know that because I logged in Quora from my mom\u2019s email address once, for reasons that had nothing to do with upvoting all my answers.That page is literal filth, clickbait answers, memes, and shitty content. That page is everything that is wrong with humanity, an insult to all serious contributors here. Now, you don\u2019t want to upvote any of that. If you do that you\u2019ll end up getting the same shit in your feed. I mean do that if it\u2019s your thing but I\u2019m pretty sure there are better websites out there for tweets. *cough, twitter, cough* What you want to do is curate your feed, it\u2019ll take a couple of days. You\u2019ll be the ones deciding what gets into your feed. Hit the X on the top left corner of the answer to ensure you don\u2019t get that kind of stuff again. If the problem still persists consider blocking/ muting the topic.Follow topics that interest you. Go through the topics and you\u2019ll definitely find writers that interest you. Now, writers, they are worth following. Read a couple of their answers and judge accordingly. But you don\u2019t want to follow a shit ton of writers, that just doesn\u2019t make sense. Liked someone\u2019s stuff a little too much, tap the notify me icon on their profile to get a notification every time they write a new answer. But that seems to be broken now, I\u2019ve heard of people not being notified. Works completely fine for me though.Commenting on other user\u2019s answers. Appreciating the answer, engaging in banter, or a heated debate. We have got it all. But take care of that dumb Be Nice Be Respectful policy or the algorithm will delete or collapse (not visible until someone is specifically looking at the collapsed comments to a particular answer.) The other day I called someone who disrespected the author a pr!ck and the comment was deleted even when the original author agreed with my assessment. But the other day I saw a completely bigoted comment and that shit was alive and healthy, with 35 other bigots upvoting the thing. Also, grammar, bad grammar will definitely collapse your comment.Did we really need a caricature for this? I don\u2019t think so.Asking questions and requesting answers. It\u2019s in the name dummy, Questions and Answers. Use your homepage to ask a question and don\u2019t forget to request answers from people who have written about the topic in the past. But don\u2019t expect every one of them to respond to your queries. Also, while requesting stuff take a moment to check whether they\u2019ve written something genuine about the topic. I once made a satirical post on Astrology and now I cannot stop getting requests for charting natal charts.Answering on Quora. Most users don\u2019t venture into answering questions, except for a couple of questions such as what is 2+2 and such basic math stuff. I went for about 3/3.5 years without answering anything. And you don\u2019t have to answer about shit unless you really have something to say (or in my case, a joke to make.) Don\u2019t expect your initial answers to blow up. I was happy when my first answer got 6 upvotes, but it\u2019s to spiral down and become an insatiable upvote hungry manic churning out answers forgetting that you have other things to care about. Oh\u2026what won\u2019t we do for fictional internet points. While uploading personal photos will guarantee (sort of) good visibility, the only other thing is writing good stuff almost regularly, do you really want to make that your identity? I saw an answer with just a photo and a quote, literally two lines. I mean use a photo but tell a life story or some shit, this is just embarrassingly pathetic.I know the answer. The dope hits are pretty addictive so I\u2019ll just post a picture and call it a day.Messaging. I\u2019ll just tell you what your opening or rather any messages shouldn't be.\u201cWould you be willing to show me your feet?\u201d\u201cHello I have an interesting prospect for you, would you like to grow rich beyond your imagination. I'm part of a great group, you just have to sign up and then get other people to sign up and you'll get a cut off all those people that you help sign up.\u201d\u201cI'm a Nigerian prince in exile\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou're are a slug sucking, goat minded, elephant-faced monkey!!!\u201d\u201cWould you consider donating to a worship place in honor of our lord and savior, Kermit the frog?\u201d You know what? Better donate, unless you want to be gulped down.Lastly, mute/block the fuck out of anything and everything that annoys you and you think should be out of your feed. And upvote everything that you think should be in your feed. It\u2019s simple.",

And according to a study, these areas are 70-75% cleaner than the rest of the city. The other aspect of the project will see the captured smog transformed into diamonds. 32% of Beijing\u2019s smog is carbon, which under 30 minutes of pressure can be turned into diamonds. The money raised by jewellery made with these diamonds will go towards supporting the development and building more Smog Free towers. For video you can click on this link World Economic Forum",

In world 6, you are a struggling comedian / musician / actor / artist, gaining a new connection. In world 7, you are a surfer. Whatever that culture may mean to them -vs- what the outside world thinks. Many answers here talk about the beach, the mountains, the hiking, and so on. In contrast, many Angelinos never go to the beach. Taking 1 hour to drive 10 miles is a strong disincentive. Most people stay in their local area. Everywhere else is \u201ctoo far.\u201d The 405 may as well be Mt Everest. Many people who live in Santa Monica won\u2019t even talk to people who live \u201cout west.\u201d LA is a collection of neighborhoods, and each neighborhood has it\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d area and \u201cbad\u201d area. Hollywood is a fine example of these extremes, where the wealthy live in the hills, yet they have to drive past large tent cities to get to the freeways. You can live in Beverly Hills, but if you walk 3 blocks south, you are in a crime-ridden area. Likewise, you can meet people who went from poverty to wealthy, and wealthy to poverty. You can meet people from all areas of the world, and honestly, everyone is a little bit broken inside. Everyone comes to LA with a gleam in their eye and a head full of hope. No one told them that the first year is extremely tough-going, and many people can\u2019t make it past the first 6 months. The locals make it hard to get past that first year: you gotta fight for the right to stay here, then the real work starts. Most people consider 5 years a decent amount of time to make it or break it. LA is constantly changing. Korea Town, Venice, Hollywood, and downtown were, at one point, gang-ridden war zones. Today, these areas are full of well-to-do people, though the remnants of their past are always visible. Even areas that are bad today are slowly morphing. The opposite is also true. What was once prime areas are now horribly dangerous places to live. The prices will get you here. Rents are constantly going up, parking isn\u2019t free anywhere, and the price difference between Ralph\u2019s and Whole Foods is edging closer to zero. A \u201ccheap\u201d beer can be found at a dive bar: 24oz Bud Lite on draft is $6. A burger and fries at Carl\u2019s Jr is $9. LA is impossible to truly describe. The best anyone can say is \u201cit depends.\u201d It depends on your background, you talents, your goals, and your luck. For those who stay, LA is a work station. Few people work \u201cjust a 9to5.\u201d They have side projects and other goals they work on. Meet enough people here and you will hear many stories of hope lost, hope found, of worlds and situations you only heard about in fiction novels. LA transplants are fighters, but always keeping their heads up.",

My parents immigrated to the city when I was a small child, and ever since then, I have been fortunate enough to call this city my home. From the towering skyline of downtown, to the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles is an amazing place to explore and experience. For most of my life, I have lived in the South Bay region of LA, which is comprised of numerous cities, including Redondo Beach, Torrance, and Manhattan Beach. This area of the city is known for its stunning beachfronts and incredible views of the Pacific Ocean. In the mornings, I love to take a walk along the pier and take in the sound of the waves crashing on the shore. Living in the South Bay also means being surrounded by a vibrant and thriving culture. Over the years, this region has become increasingly diverse, with people from all over the world coming to call the South Bay home. From the amazing art galleries and live music performances, to the diverse array of restaurants and food trucks, there is something for everyone to enjoy. When I'm in the mood to explore, I love to take a trip to downtown Los Angeles. The city was once known for its urban blight, but over the past decade, it has seen a massive transformation. From the thriving nightlife of the Arts District to the numerous museums and galleries downtown, the city has come alive with a new energy and vibrancy. The eastern side of the city is home to one of my favorite places, which is Chinatown. This historic area of the city is overflowing with incredible shopping, restaurants, and other attractions. Every time I visit Chinatown, I am amazed by the rich history and culture that it has to offer. The hustle and bustle of the streets and the smell of the various cuisines create a unique atmosphere that I absolutely love. Los Angeles is a city unlike any other, and I have been fortunate enough to call it home for most of my life. From the blue skies and sunshine, to the vibrant cultures and attractions, my life here has been nothing short of amazing. It truly is an incredible place to live. ",
            "If you're asking what's in like in L.A., you must be considering moving here. I've lived here all my life and I'll admit, it's not for everyone. In the city of Los Angeles, ironically, most people are from out of town, having moved here to pursue a career in entertainment, so I lot of people who talk about people from L.A. are really complaining about people from out of town. But those us who are from here, sometimes suffer through traffic, but usually know locals only roads to cut across town.

I've lived here all my life and I'll admit, it's not for everyone. In the city of Los Angeles, ironically, most people are from out of town, having moved here to pursue a career in entertainment, so I lot of people who talk about people from L.A. are really complaining about people from out of town. But those us who are from here, sometimes suffer through traffic, but usually know locals only roads to cut across town. The night life in New York, Miami, and Chicago could be considered better because bars are open later. Bars close at 2, mostly because L.A. is a driving town and people notoriously 'buzzed' so that's why the laws are so strict. However, some of the most talented musicians in the world come out to or are from L.A, so there is ALWAYS the finest selection of music. And no matter what your scene is, whether it's Goth, Emo, Hipster, Grunge, Drag Queen, Hip-hop... I mean WHATEVER your scene is, there's a club that caters to it somewhere in the city. As for the food. L.A. is not often mentioned as a FOODIE town, but because literally every ethnicity has settled into some part of Los Angeles, there are restaurants devoted to just about every ethnic cuisine. You want Thai food, you want Lebanese food, you want Ethiopian food, Authentic Mexican, Chinese, Indian, Soul food. you want fine dining with celebrities, you want a ma & pa greasy spoon, you want Texas style barbecue, you want Memphis style barbecue, it's ALL here. And since the majority of the worlds agriculture comes from California anyway, you get the freshest meats, fruits and vegetables, and seafood then anywhere in the country. As for the people, there are all types. There are snobs, there are gangsters, there are the homeless, there are the working class, all interwoven into the city. Tons of markets, tons of banks, tons of churches. There's beautiful beaches and coastlines to drive. There are wooded areas and hiking or mountain biking, there are skateparks. Even though we get a decent amount of snow during the winter in the mountains for skiing, down below in the city it's usually still about 75 degrees. We've got the dessert if you like that, we got Yosemite national park, we've got the sand dunes in the southern and eastern parts of California. Central California is full of agriculture and cattle and is much more rural than L.A., so if you prefer that lifestyle, you need only drive a 100 miles or so north. In essence, everything you need is here. Any lifestyle you have is here. Any climate you prefer is here. So, I love it, and I wouldn't want to live anywhere else."

Buy a cappuccino. Buy a Texas French cinnamon toast. Then, take a bite of the toast, followed by a sip of cappuccino, followed by a sip of fresh coconut water. It's amazing. Grab a bottle of Bruce Cost's Ginger Ale and a fresh peach at Bi-Rite Grocery. Head towards Dolores Park on a sunny Saturday afternoon and plant yourself at the corner of 20th & Church Street where you can sit, enjoy your drink, and contemplate life as you take in some of the most gorgeous and relaxing views of the city. Buy a cigar at Grant's Tobacconist. Walk up Nob Hill from California Ave and when you reach the classy Huntington Park, light it up and enjoy while sitting on a bench in front of the fountain. Then check out Grace Cathedral next door and the side-courtyard with the fountain.Take your date and walk up to Russian Hill Place (Vallejo St. & Florence St.) and check out the lovely mansions and their manicured gardens. Walk all the way to the end of the Cul De Sac, stand on the balcony, and take in the views. Then peek around the corner and go down the staircase - you'll see even more houses and gardens. Keep going through Ina Coolbirth Park until you reach Vallejo St. Grab dinner in Chinatown or Little Italy - whichever strikes your fancy.Continue through Vallejo until you see Caffe Trieste (Vallejo & Grant) - my favorite North Beach Cafe. If you make it here on a Saturday afternoon you'll run into an Italian instrumental and operatic performance. If you're in SOMA, check out South Park. It's a cozy, quiet alcove filled with lovely trees and benches. Perfect place to have a weekday lunch. Grab an espresso at Caffe Centro and walk around the oval. This park is famous for all the start-ups that originated in the area and serves as a quiet and peaceful escape from the bustle of King St.Also in SOMA, drop by Ritch Street during a week day around noon. On one end, there's Cafe Cento. They brew blue bottle and I recommend their Iced Cento drink. Next to Cento is Farmer Brown's Little Skillet and people tend to like their chicken & waffles, but I prefer the grits and sausage. Enjoy your southern comfort food and blue bottle in the sun while sitting on the ledge outside. On the other end of Ritch Street there's a high-quality cafe called Cafe Darwin. Everything on their menu is fresh, local, organic, prepared with attention to detail and downright delicious. They have a thing for French cuisine. I guess you could call it \"Frenchfranciscan\"! If you're feeling \"healthy\", grab one of their famous kale salads. If you're feeling cold from the fog, grab a cappuccino and a nutella-mascarpone baguette. Get legitimate off-the-beaten-path Asian food on Clement Street. Burmese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Cantonese - it's all there. Also drop by Green Apple Books (check out their Used Book annex if you want to save money and buy a book in top condition) and lose yourself in a book while enjoying bubble tea.Mojo Bicycle Cafe! If you are by Alamo Square Park, be sure to drop by Mojo Bicycle Cafe, an incredibly cute coffee bicycle shop that really comes to life after 5pm. The neighborhood comes here for beer, sangria, and great conversation in the evening. Corona Heights! A pretty hill with a gorgeous vista that doesn't get many visitors outside of dog owners chilling in the adjacent doggy park. I recommend walking down Masonic Ave to get there and enjoying the beautiful mansions along the way. I love this park, it's surrounded by a lovely stair-cased part of town filled with cherry blossoms. Anthony's Cookies on 25th and Valencia! I highly recommend Cookie Dough, Peanut Butter, and Toffee Chip flavors. They go well with a bottle of Strauss milk. For a great night out in the Mission, I recommend Revolution Cafe on 22nd and Bartlett. Grab a beer or wine and enjoy live music and performances every night of the week. It's an intimate, fun, lively setting - where all us locals go. :) MISSION DISTRICT ESPRESSO BAR HOPPINGGrab a few friends and get one drink per place to taste. Ritual RoastersThe baristas at Ritual are extremely skilled and make everything incredibly well. If you've never had a non-Starbucks macchiato and you're feeling adventurous, Ritual is the perfect place to try your first one.Otherwise, I recommend any of their sweet tooth espressos and their heavenly pour-over coffees. Philz at 24th and FolsomGet a Jacob's with medium cream and medium sugar if you're there for the first time.For your second time, try a Tesora.For your third time, try a Philtered Soul.If you're a Philz connoisseur and Phil is there, ask him to make you one of his secret blends. If not, ask for a Four Great Horses. If you're a Philz connoisseur and a patisserie lover, drop by Knead Patisserie next door and enjoy a pastry. Knead is hidden in the very back of Local: Mission Eatery. On weekday mornings they often have a cart right outside the restaurant. Every single thing I've tried there is made in heaven.Four Barrel - Caledonia AlleyOn the weekends, get your macchiato from Caledonia Alley in the back of Four Barrel. Grand CoffeeIf you're by the 24th St BART station, I highly recommend Grand on Mission and 23rd. They often make four barrel coffee better than four barrel. They also have amazing pastries from Knead Patisserie.  Rodger's CoffeeHidden on 20th and San Carlos is an incredible Philz-style pour over place called Rodger's. They have pretty incredible coffee here. I highly recommend Morning Ritual, Fog Lifter, and Jet Fuel (in that order). I have tried every single blend of theirs and these three are the best!NIGHT LIFE: CLASSY LOUNGESHere are three swanky lounges where you can impress your date with your great taste in cigars and hard liquor. Herradura, anyone? :)  Cigar BarCigar Bar is a lounge, bar, and restaurant with - yes - cigars, latin dancing, and live music. Lively ambiance, high energy. 25 LuskA swanky lounge in SOMA with a great ambiance, no cover, wide selection of drinks, and lots of comfortable places to sit. Great place to sit close to your date.  Chambers Eat + DrinkI love their BE AMAZING lights at the bar. I also love the heterogeneity of the crowd here - lots of different people from different places. Chambers feels like your classy friend's swanky living room and they also have a pool in the back. Great place for a group or a date, no cover at the door, and you can dress fairly casual, too.  JonesJones has an incredible outdoor patio and garden lounge. Jones really comes alive and is very sexy at night. I asked the bartender to surprise me with a mixed drink and I don't remember what it was (yup, it was a good night) but it was damn good. And it had a thin orange peel on the bottom.  ",

Looking down at 800000 other people's worlds does that to me.  This is a very different feeling from most of the day which is likely spent either looking at a screen or off in my head. My favorite views were Tank Park Hill, Grandview Park, and a random street in Glen Park (will look it up).  These are incredibly good places to have a hot tea/mulled wine and gather perspective. Sunday streetsThis is an event the city puts on at different neighborhoods each Sunday (during the summers?).  They close down several blocks to cars so that people can use the entire street.  Valencia and 24th are the streets that close in the mission (my favorite Sunday Streets).  They open up to a lot of music, booths, rollerbladers, and people just moseying, taking it slow. Surf or bodyboardSince you live on the Ocean, it's worth getting in it at least once.  Pacifica, just south of the city, is a good beginners beach to try body boarding and surfing.  Getting hit by your first wave as you're swimming out is sort of like being socked in the face with a 5 pound bag of ice.  It's that refreshing.  Go on a warm day and rent gear at one of the shops there.  The shop guys are helpful and you won't be the only tourist.  Even if you never catch a wave (I didn't), it still extremely fun and relaxing to be swimming and bobbing around.  I thought \", Oh yeah, I live on the Ocean!\" Team SportsSF has quite a few adult inter mural leagues.  Many of them are dodgeball but some mix in other sports (Sunday Recess).  I tried both Sunday Recess and Trampoline Dodgeball (there are many other leagues).  Sunday Recess is much more of a drinking club than a sports league.  That's fun too but I was hoping to play longer than 30-40 minutes.  To each their own!   Trampoline Dodgeball was more my thing.  You pay something like 70 bucks for 7 games.  In between the dodgeball games, you can bounce and do flips around a room that is made up of 16 large trampolines attached together.  This was insanely fun and good exercise.  During the dodgeball games, people play hard but are very good sports.  It made me look forwards to Tuesdays. MeditationThe Bay Area has a number of places with group meditation.  Hey, you can meditate anywhere, but sometimes it's nice to do it with other people. Mission Dharma (google for location) in the mission has meditation on Tuesday nights.  You get there, sit down, and are just present and still with 50 other people.  It didn't feel goofy or new agey in the slightest.  Just a bunch of people taking the time to be present together.  Afterward, the meditation leader gives a talk on a contemporary topic and ties it in with meditation.  The guy was extremely humble, accessible, and easy to follow. I'm guessing there's many other events like this in the bay. Poetry readingThis is another one I didn't delve into very much.  I saw a good poetry reading at the now closed Om Shanti Tea House and at the 16th street BART station.  The 16th street BART station poetry reading is very cool and very random.  That BART station is probably the skeeviest one in the city.  I got my rear wheel ripped off while my bike was locked inside the station and I was volunteering for the Bike Coalition.  Watch your things/bike.  I digress, the poetry reading happens at night around 8-9pm.  A number of people, many homeless, get together on the ground to share their poetry.  It's real and raw.  Many of the guys' poems are about rough upbringings and life on the street.  You hear their stories and sense their humanity.  It's a beautiful moment in an ugly place.  Art WalksArt walks form when the restaurants and shops in a block or neighborhood open up for art, music, and drinks for a night.  In the Bay, they range from the smaller quiet neighborhoods arts walk to the MAPP(Mission Arts Performance Project) to Oakland First Fridays (which closes several blocks for all sorts of live music, comedy, fashion shows, art, food carts, and stands).   I haven't attended too many of the smaller art walks but I'll swear by the MAPP and Oakland First Fridays.  Oakland first fridays is like a really condensed and diverse slice of Burning Man.  People come out to be creative, friendly or both.  You get there, hit foot carts, followed by hip hop/freestyling 20 feet later, 20 feet after that there's a youth fashion show, 20 ft after that will be some random dudes drumming, 20 feet after that comedy, 20 feet after that break beat DJs, 20 feet after that booth's where you can \"ask an atheist\" or \"ask a woman\", I could go on.  It's a smogarboard of wonderful randomness.  I went to that event for 10 months straight.  Sometimes with friends, sometimes alone.  I always made conversation with friendly strangers of all sorts of backgrounds and colors.  It might be the friendliest and freest place I've been to the in the US. MAPP happens every 2 months in the mission.  Mission residents and business owners open their homes/businesses up for performances and art.  The performances are usually a mixture of spoken word and live acoustic sets.  A good chunk of the music is Latin Music (be it Peruvian drumming or live salsa music).  It can get a bit crowded but it's still worth hitting up. Check out the MAPP and First Fridays and keep an eye out (or check google) for the smaller art walks.  They're a great way to connect with the artistic side of the city and meet new people.  German tourist clubThe German Tourist Club is a place in the middle of the woods on Mt. Tam where you can drink good beer and play board games on a deck.  It's open to the public on certain sundays each month.  You can get to it by driving or hiking (the beer tastes better when you've earned it).  Roof ExploringDo this one with caution.  A lot of SF apartments have easy roof access.  You can also walk from from one roof to another quite easily.  I've walked entire blocks on the roof.  This is illegal, slightly dangerous, but really interesting and fun.  From the last apartment I lived in I could walk to the roofs on the end of the block and see nearly every part of the city.  MuralsSF has more murals that anywhere else I've seen on the west coast.  Most of the murals have a story behind the murals and/or elements within it.  I went on a Mural Tour in the Mission where the guide explained what many of the Latino(a) murals meant.  I learned about the interesting back stories of migrant workers, life back in El Salvador/Mexico/other countries, or the symbolism of this is talking about gentrification or HIV or desaparecidos.  Going on a tour or reading about the murals ahead of time allows you to see and appreciate elements you would have glazed over otherwise. Beach FireThere are fire pits on Ocean Beach where they let you make fires.  You have to get there pretty early and bring your own wood but it's worth it.  You would think it would be too cold and windy to do.  But as soon as the sun goes down, the wind nearly dies off and the fire is plenty to keep you warm.  It so cool to stand at the wake in the dark with the city on one side of you and the enormous ocean on the other.",
