In this \u201cinterview\u201d the columnist credited Elvis for saying some terrible things about Black Americans. It was totally made up and untrue, done so because Elvis was unable to visit the magazines office as once agreed. So, the writer and the magazine conspired to slander Elvis. The one, little known fact I remind anybody who spews this nonsense about Mr Presley is the first person to go to Graceland to console Elvis\u2019 family was Mr. James Brown! Mr. Brown was more than just a musical genius and celebrity, he was a freedom fighter who spoke at length through his music and to anyone who would listen about the plight of Black Americans. If Elvis was such a racist and thief of black culture, James Brown would not have loved and respected the man as much as he did - they were good friends! James Brown called Elvis his \u201cbrother\u201d. Let\u2019s not ever forget that FACT! Say what you want about Elvis, if James Brown respected and loved him, that\u2019s more than enough for me.",

In researching his definitive two-volume Presley biography, Peter Guralnick asked everyone he could find who was around Presley when he might have said such a thing whether they knew or even suspected he said it. The unanimous answer was: not a chance. As a teenager, Presley hung out on Beale Street in Memphis whenever he was able to, just to absorb the culture he loved. He used his fame to employ and promote Black musicians and songwriters whenever he could. To his dying day, he felt like he was unworthy of filling the shoes of Arthur Crudup, the guy who originally sang \u201cThat\u2019s All Right.\u201d Elvis Presley was not racist.",

            "Elvis Presley was known for his exceptional singing and stage presence, but he was not widely recognized for his guitar playing skills. However, he was proficient at rhythm guitar and often used it during his performances. While he may not have been considered a virtuoso on the instrument, his guitar playing was an important part of his overall musical style and performance.",
            "When Elvis first started out he was seen as a guitar player. However, our notion of what a great, or even a good, guitar player is has become limited to lead guitarists; people like Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, Angus Young, Eddie Van Halen, etc., who are known and revered as guitar gods. We don\u2019t think of Maclom Young \u2013 Angus\u2019 brother- as a great guitarist even though his rhythm playing is great. IMO Elvis was a great rhythm guitarist.

I don\u2019t know if he would have been a great, or even a good, rhythm guitarist for other singers but for accompanying himself he was perfect. Jimmy Page stated in a 2020 interview that Elvis played \u201cincredible rhythm guitar\u201d on the Sun singles. Johnny Cash wrote in his autobiography that when he saw Elvis perform in 1954, the thing he really noticed was Elvis\u2019s guitar playing. \u201cElvis was a fabulous rhythm player. He\u2019d start in \u2018That\u2019s All Right, Mama\u2019 with his own guitar alone, and you didn\u2019t want to hear anything else. I didn\u2019t, anyway. I was disappointed when Scotty Moore and Bill Black jumped in and covered him up\u2026You know, I\u2019ve never heard or read anyone else praising Elvis as a rhythm guitar player, and after the Sun [Records] days I never heard his own guitar on his records.\u201d Just watch the sit-down sessions of Elvis\u2019 68 Comeback Special and you will see how perfectly he accompanies himself on guitar, and how his singing style was developed simultaneously with his guitar playing. When I watch Elvis sing and play guitar I can see how it all fits together. He allows the musical energy of both his singing and guitar playing to freely flow through his body and they all feed off each other and blend into one instrument. A true thing of beauty to watch as few guitarists/singers ever reached this point of oneness. Jimi Hendrix is another guitarist/singer I think who also reached the point of oneness between guitar, voice and body. Although, after his early rise to fame, Elvis mostly performed without playing guitar, he was the kind of guitarist that was damn entertaining to watch just playing guitar and singing by himself, and that IMO is a good guitarist. The irony is, despite Elvis not being known as a great, or even a good, guitarist a lot of kids \u2013 many we now call great guitarists and great artists - were inspired to pick up a guitar and play after seeing Elvis with his guitar on TV, and in the movies, in the mid 50s.",

Also, he valued purity in women. According to his wife Priscilla they didn\u2019t consummate their relationship until after they were married even though they lived together for six years until then. Elvis was old fashioned that way.He met his wife Priscilla when she was 14. They moved in together when she was 16, for which he asked her parents\u2019 permission first, and they married in Las Vegas in 1967, when Priscilla was 22. Their daughter was born exactly 9 months later. By the time she was 23 and had a baby, he lost sexual interest in her, hence their divorce. Elvis Presley, who adored his mother Gladys, could not have sex with his child\u2019s mother out of respect for her. He was a traditional man who didn\u2019t like his wife to work as he could offer her everything, hence Priscilla said he was oppressive and jealous. He did cheat on her however but it was only Anne Margret, his Viva Las Vegas co-star, whom Priscilla admitted she feared the most, and with whom Elvis stayed friends until the end. Priscilla smashed a vase when she was informed about their affair. Elvis remained friends with Priscilla AFTER the divorce and she would even advise his new girlfriend on how to take care of him. Elvis and Priscilla, who said that Elvis was her first and true love, would talk FOR HOURS on the phone FOR YEARS after they divorced. Elvis had a thing for beauty queens. Linda Thompson, Cybill Shepherd, and Ginger Alden, Elvis\u2019 girlfriends, were all beauty pageant winners. Elvis was a womanizer and a gentleman. He loved women too much. Elvis would always arise from his seat when a woman entered or exited the room. According to Linda Thompson, he broke his world record of faithfulness the first year they were together but later on he had indiscretions about which he apologized to her and he even cried. Linda Thompson, who dated Elvis Presley for 4 1/2 years, met him when she was 22, and she, too, like Priscilla, was a virgin. Elvis loved children and animals. Once he went to a pet store and he bought 15 puppies. He cleaned out every cage. He bought every puppy in the store. He kept a few and he gifted the rest to his friends and his girlfriend\u2019s parents. Elvis used to say that Dog is God spelled backwards!!!! He also had a pet monkey named Scatter.Boy was the first dog Elvis acquired shortly after he began to achieve stardom. He always loved animals, but he could never have one when he was younger, so he made up for that when he became a star. Baba was the Collie that went to Hollywood with Elvis and can be seen in the movie Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966). Also, he gave his mother a tiny dog named Sweet Pea. He also had horses, which he adored, a Mynah bird, and peacocks in Graceland. Elvis was very child-like, which was part of his charm and part of his downfall.Presley loved the army, police, and guns. He stalled his career to do his military service. He liked to dress up as a police officer and pretend to give fines to drivers. He gave them his autograph instead. He had a collection of guns.Also, he loved shotguns and shooting at TV sets and furnitue. Elvis had an actual TV graveyard in the backyard at Graceland and would often pull out a .357 magnum from his collection of guns and blast at TV sets. It was a joke that ended with the punch line, 'take it to the graveyard.' His girlfriend Linda Thompson said that she once got out of the shower, still in a towel, and Elvis shot at the TV which was right next to her. Otherwise, she said that Elvis was Santa Claus and Prince Charming in one. She wrote poetry about Elvis and she told Larry King she could never love anyone else the way she loved Elvis. Elvis liked being mothered by women, though he usually dated younger women than him, and wanted to hold Thompson\u2019s hand when he was in the hospital. Elvis was watching TV one night when Robert Goulet appeared on the screen. Elvis pulled a .357 out of his boot, shot the TV, and supposedly said, \"Get that @$*% outta' my house!\"\u009d. Elvis had a temper but he was harmless. He had mood swings. Elvis loved cars, especially Cadillacs.He liked to drive, especially at night. Also, he liked playing the guitar and the piano. He had a huge collection of cars and motorcycles. He also loved elaborate stage clothes and jewellery. Elvis was a spendaholic and died with a net worth of only $5.5 million even though he made $250 million in his lifetime. He gave 1000 concerts in his lifetime, all sold out. He gave $35 million to charity. He was generous to a fault. At some point he bought 10 Mercedes-Benz and 32 shotguns for Christmas alone! He grew up in poverty and he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with all the money he had; thus, he gave it away. Elvis used to say: \u2018\u2019I want to share my wealth with my friends and the world.\u2019\u2019 He gave his Memphis Mafia entourage a bonus every time he toured. He toured 10 times a year !!!! His manager Colonel Parker, however, always took 50% of Elvis\u2019 income.He had an entourage called the Memphis Mafia on whom he was literally dependent as he was by nature shy. Elvis, whose twin brother was stillborn, grew up as an only child. According to Elvis\u2019 best friend Joe Esposito, Elvis had very few friends in Mississipi because he was considered the \u2018\u2019weird\u2019\u2019 kid. Elvis was a mama\u2019s boy. He helped his mother pick cotton and he used to sing with her. He used to talk \u201cbaby talk\u201d with his mother Gladys, who liked Anita Wood the most of all Elvis\u2019 girlfriends. Elvis related better to women than men.He lavished his friends with expensive gifts and covered their expenses. He used to give his friends and even random strangers Cadillacs and money. Priscilla Presley said that when Elvis had a fight with someone he would always buy them an expensive present later to make amends. When his father Vernon fired three of the Memphis Mafia, either to cut down on expenses or because they were too aggressive with Elvis\u2019s fans (the Memphis Mafia were also Elvis\u2019s bodyguards), they decided to write a tell-all book on Elvis for money (what else?), which devastated Elvis and put an additional strain on his health. By then, Elvis already suffered from diabetes and hypertension due to his unhealthy eating habits. He unsuccessfully tried to prevent the book from being published by offering the publishers a lot of money. Elvis loved food. What Southerner doesn\u2019t? Thus, he battled his weight. He liked fried food, mashed potatoes, bacon, and steak. His favorite appetizer was fried sandwich with peanut butter, banana, and bacon!!!He was acutely sensitive to criticism about his weight, which hurt his feelings a lot. Therefore, he often resorted to crash diets and he only ate melon and grapefruit. Also, he would never read critiques about his performances, whether they were good or bad. In addition, he was insomniac and a sleepwalker. Elvis used to sleep all day and stay up all night. That was a main reason he put on weight as people with low metabolism like Elvis tend to store fat when they don\u2019t get enough sleep at night. He used to rely for spiritual advice on his hair stylist who supplied him with books that he read non-stop. He was an avid reader and very religious. Also, he dyed his hair dark, though he was naturally blond. He started dying his hair in high school.Elvis admired James Dean so much that he dated Natalie Wood - Dean\u2019s Rebel Without a Cause co-star. His mother Gladys didn\u2019t like Natalie Wood but she got along with Anita Wood, Elvis\u2019 Number 1 girlfriend, who truly loved Elvis and even gave up a Paramount Pictures contract for his sake. Elvis often dated his leading ladies. Natalie Wood said she felt like she had been dating a high school boy when she went out with Elvis who didn\u2019t drink alcohol or smoke at the time. Though he later smoked cigars, Elvis never drank alcohol. Elvis, who had a photographic memory, memorized all of Dean\u2019s lines and studied his movies in his attempt to become a great actor like Dean. He was devastated when James Dean was tragically killed in a car crash in 1955.Regardless of his \u2018\u2019strange\u2019\u2019 habits, Elvis Presley was an amazing performer, a great vocalist, and he had a heart of gold.",

Happily married life with kids is amazing. Putting them through their parents\u2019 divorce isn\u2019t. Even though, Jennifer\u2019s divorce was a more heart wrenching one. At least no kids suffer because of that. I would better be Jennifer. And above all : THAT GORGEOUS RACHEL HAIR.Image sources: Google Images.",
            "I would have to say the later because every single time I see a picture of Jennifer Aniston I get the uncontrollable urge to go onto Ifooku. c o m and find me someone to mess around with under the covers. No other famous women does this to me but her. It is a weird thing, but she has some super human booby booty powers. Plus she is funny, goofy and hot all at the same time. So if I were her I could just look in the mirror to get revved up.

            "She's a diva, her niceness is so fake it's disgusting. I used to work in a concert arena and it was known that shes a high maintenance me-me my poop doesnt stink jerk. Everything in her room had to be white, she made them close and sanitize the entire child playroom for only her kid or kids whatever she has. That isnt so bad, if you got the money to do that then do it. What was bad was that a doorman looked at her and apparently she hates when staff look at her. So she started yelling at her whoever about it, in front of the doorman like he wasn't there.

So she started yelling at her whoever about it, in front of the doorman like he wasn't there. He said, so much for Jenny from the block, well she got him fired. So it was known that when she came around,you dont look at her, because God forbid your plebian eyes gaze upon her. To her fans, obviously she's going to act different. To those who worked her venue, it was well known that she was an a hole.",
            "I didn't look at what other people have said but I know two people that had interactions with her. One in a professional level and the other in a casual. First, was a friend of my wife who worked at the casino as a dealer and Jennifer and her mother had come in and jennifer treated her as a mechanical shuffle machine. The mother was trying to be nice at the end her mother, started to give my wife's friend 25 dollar tip and jennifer was like * Mom no!\u201d The woman thought maybe Jennifer was going to tip herself. But they got up and walked away.

The mother was trying to be nice at the end her mother, started to give my wife's friend 25 dollar tip and jennifer was like * Mom no!\u201d The woman thought maybe Jennifer was going to tip herself. But they got up and walked away. The second person worked as as a grip at studios in Queens NY and he was on set for a shoot with jennifer lopez. They were told not to look at her. No one was allowed to speak to her and she spoke to no one. My friend showed me her picture ( that he took from with his phone with her from behind and slightly to the side as she looked over city lights, ( which I believe the city lights was a set to make it look like Manhattan) the picture he took was highly illegal by her standards. No one on the set cared that he took the picture he just had to be stealth from her and her people. You hear these things and you think it has to be made up. Imagine going to work and they say jennifer lopez is coming in , no one can look at her. So these are absolutely true events. I had to laugh cause her commercial came on of her selling some vitamin supplement and I said to my wife\u2026look it's Jenny from the block. ( You know her old promotional advertising logo to tell us she is down to earth) I said to my wife could you imagine being on the set of that commercial with her? Knowing no one could look at her and her true nature being an ass and she is able, with all that going on just starts a monolog like she is just \u201c Jenny from the block\u201d. It's mind boggling.",
            "She is definitely not the \u201cJenny from the block\u201d image that she wants everyone to believe she is. Her movie The Wedding Planner was filmed in San Francisco and scenes were shot inside city hall. In San Francisco, Deputies from the SF Sheriffs Department are responsible for the security of the building. I spoke to a couple of them afterwards and they didn\u2019t have anything good to say about her other than the fact that she\u2019s a diva.",
            "And she lies with a smile. Face lift. Lots of surgery\u2019s to fine tune her face. She had a boxy nose. Now slim and rounded. Her jaw line and wrinkles started going south in her 40s. She picked it up before it got to a point of being overly obvious. She\u2019s love bombing the audience but acts like the devil in a dress behind closed doors. Typical grandiose narcissist."
