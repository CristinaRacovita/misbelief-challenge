He can\u2019t keep a promise to his wife and will throw as much money as possible at lawyers to stop you knowing his levels of deception. If he is like this with his family, how would he behave with you and me?He was fired from The Times for making up a quote from his own godfather. Forget the consequences and who it harms, he lives in the moment, he will lie and see what happens. Maybe he will get caught, maybe he won't and either way, he knows his lies won't affect his career as is evident now.As the British Foreign Secretary, his responsibility was to help British citizens. His involvement with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case, saw her sentence increased! Because he is such a blundering fool, he said something about NZR that was untrue. Using his position of office, Johnson has demonstrably and verifiably harmed a British citizen, when his only job was to assist. If a Dr could be proven to harm a patient on purpose or by negligence we wouldn't be seeking to promote them.He colluded with an old school friend to have a journalist beaten up. We trust journalists to speak truth to power, BJ will help a mate of his (who was trying to bury an investigation into his fraud and was later convicted of fraud.) BJ will assist criminals in getting journalist beaten up. If BJ comes to power, he could feasibly seek to physically harm his opponents and those that write about him and even if he personally doesn't go that far, he offers his support to those that do.The London Olympics and the \u201cBoris bikes\u201d both commenced under his premiership, however, they were both initiated and secured by his predecessor, Ken Livingstone. His most popular legacies had nothing to do with him so what has he ever achieved?He promised not to close down any fire stations, then he sold off fire stations. This increased the time it takes to get to fires. Then there was Grenfell. Bear in mind that he will live in a property that has sprinklers, modern (no combustible) electronics. He himself is shielded from the harmful policies he inflicts on others.He said \u201cFuck Business\u201d. Tories are the party of business, not according to Boris. This means that if he gets into power, fuck everyone else but him.He said, if elected he would lay down in front of bulldozers to stop an extra runway being built. This show he will say anything to get elected and will not keep his words. (I, personally want more runways, but he knew this would get him votes, he got them and then was like \u201cjust kidding\u201d.)Arguably the height of corruption, he wanted to build \u201cThe garden bridge\u201d he didnt put it to a legal tender, he appointed his friends businesses, he lost \u00a345m (which his friends gained) and not a single brick was laid. He is corrupt and will use his position to empty the government coffers and help out his mates. How much and how this money makes its way back to him, we may never know.He is paid circa \u00a3270,000 per year to write for the Telegraph. The British public pay him just a fraction of what his private backers pay him, so who do you think has more sway on him, those that pay him the big bucks to represent their interests, or us. It stands to reason that he wants to use his position to change policy to benefit those that pay him the most significant part of his income.",

Currently he claims to support roll-out of high speed broadband to all areas of the country \u2013 but you can be sure that when the Press provide the estimated cost, this policy statement will prove to be an \u2018ambition\u2019. Just as his promise to raise the tax threshold for higher rate payers has morphed into an \u2018ambition.\u2019 Johnson has an overpowering sense of personal entitlement. He truly believes he deserves to be Prime Minister. It follows that nothing must come between him and this goal. I think it highly likely that chicanery was employed to ensure he did not face Gove in the election for Conservative party leader. In the first televised hustings featuring himself and Hunt, Johnson proved incapable of answering any question squarely, for fear of creating a hostage to fortune. We can expect him as far as possible to avoid all other such public events, preferring instead to field deniable proxies to advance his cause. I am sure that Johnson does have some ideas \u2013 lower taxation, a freewheeling, export led economy, even some traditional \u2018One Nation Tory\u2019 policies to alleviate the lot of the disadvantaged. But you can be sure they are nebulous, un-costed and conveniently sacrificial, should the going get heavy. After all, when you deserve to be PM, you have no need to justify yourself; you can leave the difficult stuff to others! *I have suggested in a response to another Quora question that, lacking principles of any kind, he would be readier than most to revoke Article 50 should the need/opportunity arise.",

When Ronald Reagan was president, I was out of the Navy at this point but I\u2019d get up, go to work, come home, eat dinner, take out the trash, do some laundry, watch some TV, play my guitar and go to bed. When George Bush Sr. was president, I\u2019d get up, feed the dogs and cats, go to work, come home, ride my mountain bike, eat dinner, take out the trash, do some laundry, play guitar, maybe watch some TV, go to bed. When Bill Clinton was president, I\u2019d get up, feed the dogs and cats, go to work, come home, ride my mountain bike or my road bike, eat dinner, take out the trash, do some laundry, play guitar, do some computer stuff, maybe watch some TV, go to bed. When George W.

When Barack Obama was President, I\u2019d get up, feed the dogs and cats, go to work, come home, ride my mountain bike or my road bike or take the Harley out, maybe do my podcast, eat dinner or go out to eat, take out the trash, do some laundry, play guitar, do some computer stuff, probably not watch TV, go to bed. When Donald Trump was President, I got up, fed the dogs and cats, worked remotely at home, ride my mountain bike or my road bike or take the Harley out, maybe do my podcast or interview someone, eat dinner or go out to eat, take out the trash, do some laundry, play guitar, do some computer stuff, watch a little TV, do some gaming and go to bed. So you see boys and girls, regardless of what nincompoop is beating their chest in the white house, I still have my life to live, I have my responsibilities and I have a family that depends on me to keep them safe, warm, fed and under a roof. There is nothing that my government says or does that interferes with what I need to do, what I have to do or what I want to do. I am responsible for my own successes and failures in my life, not whatever asshat was elected to run this country. I neither hate or love whoever occupies the oval office, they have no impact on my life and I will not LET THEM impact my life. Mr. Trump\u2019s job, as was all the presidents before him, is to run this country. My job is to live my life to its fullest and be the best person I can for myself, my family and my country and do so without excuses. What\u2019s it like to live in the USA under Trump? No different than any other day under any other president. Because that\u2019s the way I choose to live it. EDIT Addition:With Biden as president. Well\u2026 here\u2019s where it got interesting. The \u201cscamdemic\u201d comes to visit. Yes it did arrive in 2020 (hmmm\u2026 during an election year\u2026. imagine that) and Trump was in office. Upon the placement of FJB in the racist house (because it\u2019s white ya know) things went to shit. This is the only administration in my lifetime that has attempted to control my life, tell me what to do, prevent me from doing things and threatening my way of life. I still did what I had to do around my home as I did during other presidency\u2019s. I still conducted myself the same way though I was limited to what I was \u201callowed\u201d to do by the government in the public theater. Now before you go and say \u201cWell there was a pandemic\u201d, understand that it was a pandemic where it was convenient. Non-tax revenue places were closed (local/state/national parks, beaches, etc.) while tax revenue places were open (Walmart, Home depot, etc.). So\u2026.. outside in the fresh air bad, Recirculated inside air good? It was a political and big pharma money grab at best, and an experiment in the control, but that\u2019s a topic for another day. As with other administrations, costs increased. Dem or GOP, didn\u2019t matter. The cost of living would rise regardless of who was in office. With FJB we saw an exponential increase and it hit all Americans hard. Regardless, I carried on as I normally would though now \u201cfrugal\u201d became part of my daily lexicon. Age and relocation allowed me to retire in the beginning of 2023. However IF I remained in New Jersey(D), I would not have been able to retire. Regardless, I still work part time now to float on the water. Without turning this into a FJB rant, it saddens me greatly when I go into any big box store and I see elderly people working in these places, shuffling along, stocking shelves, working cash registers or gathering shopping carts in the parking lot (shouldn\u2019t young people be doing this?). When I ask them why they are there and not enjoying their retirement, they say because they need the money because their social security or pension isn\u2019t enough, when it used to be. Never in my life have I ever seen this. So here is where the question should be \u201cWhat is it like to live in the United States under Joe Biden?\u201d. Pretty much the same as other presidents only harder. AUTHOR NOTE #1:Thank you so much for all of the upvotes!! Just be a good American, love your country, support the president and take care of your family. And dammit, be a good neighbor. That person who lives next to you has shit to deal with too and there is no reason to not say hello once in a while or invite them over for a BBQ. That\u2019s what we do as Americans. Be neighborly, even to the person you\u2019re standing in line with, it\u2019s not hard to do. And for God sake, turn off the TV, turn off the news and stop letting the media drive your emotions. They do that on purpose! Life is too short to be a miserable prick because \u201cyour guy\u201d didn\u2019t get elected. Love your freedom, Love the stars and stripes, Love your country. AUTHOR NOTE #2:I am a military veteran. Go Navy! I am a motorcycle rider who participates in charity events where we raise money for veterans, children, first responders and animals. I have an American flag on my riding vest, on my truck and on my house. I wave to police officers as I ride by on my American made Harley Davidson, they wave back. RESPECT. Some of my best friends are men of color, some of my business associates are as well and some are Hispanic. AUTHOR NOTE #3:There is this sad misconception that the president\u2019s job is to see to it that the people of this country are taken care of. That is NOT in the job description. You\u2019ll note that no where in my answer did I mention or say that the President of the United States took care of me. The job any president has is to run the country and by \u201cRun the country\u201d I mean he is to ensure it is secure for the people who live in it and ensure that the people of the country are continued to have the freedom to choose their own life\u2019s path. His job is not to provide for us. At some point that was our parents job. For your children, that is your job. When your parents provided for you, they were in charge of your life, just as you are in charge of your children\u2019s lives because you are you their provider. We never want a president, governor, mayor or legislator to be our providers, ever! Because when they do become your providers, they are in charge of your life and free to tell you what to do. It is so sad to hear that so many people think it\u2019s the governments job to take care of it\u2019s people. Take care of yourself and those you love.",

The next night, everyone was having dinner on an outdoor patio in town when a jeep drove by the patio. A young shaved headed white guy leaned out of the jeep and bellowed \u201cWHITE POWER\u201d at all the diners. I have been to that area a few times and hadn\u2019t seen anything remotely like that until Trump was elected. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s empowered and emboldened these elements to be more vocal, more aggressive. Sand Point is a beautiful, laid back town, and in my experience is a more liberal island in a sea of very conservative, even radical, people. I had considered it a great place to jet for a weekend or go boating. I\u2019m never going back again.",

This is called Radiative forcing and this is a physical law. Anyone can test the radiative forcings for each gas in school lab. The present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:Carbon dioxide: 1.5 Watts per square meter.Methane: 0.5 Watts per square meter.Nitrous oxide: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Halocarbons: 0.2 Watts per square meter.Water vapor: 0.2 watts per square meterTotal radiative forcings from all greenhouse gases: 2.6 Watts per square meter.3: Energy absorbed through CO2 Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each. This is easy to understand. 4: The consequences This leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Less iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released \u2192 higher temperaturesMore darker surface area that reflect less sunlight (6%) and less white areas that reflect more sunlight (60%) \u2192 higher temperaturesMore release of CO2 and water vapor from the oceans when the oceans gets warmer \u2192 higher temperaturesMore droughts \u2192 More forest fires \u2192 more co2 \u2192 higher temperaturesLess iceLots of additional greenhouse gases that were trapped in ice released \u2192 higher temperaturesAnd so forth. This cascading effect repeats itself constantly.Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results in increase in energy absorption by 3%. With the increase of energy absorption of 1.1% by 2.6 watts from 235 to 237.6 watts/m2, we can expect an increase in energy absorption by 3.3%. This is where we are at right now and this cascading effect is not reversible for several hundred years even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes 200 years on average for CO2 to be reabsorbed by the surface or by the oceans. With another doubling of CO2, we can look at a total increase of 10% in energy absorption. Here is what happens when the sun delivered 10% more energy in the past. It led to an average temperature increase of 4 degrees Celcius.A temperature increase of 4 degrees would make the home of 90% of the world\u2019s population uninhabitable and destroy 90% of arable land.Potentially moving to newly thawn land on the poles is also not feasible, because it takes hundreds to thousands of years for newly thawn land to be solid enough to sustain roads, buildings and to become arable for agriculture. 5: What it is not One of the popular arguments is that water vapor is responsible for the greenhouse effect. It is responsible for 60% of the greenhouse effect, but we cannot contribute to it via human emissions, because human water vapor emissions stay close to the surface and don\u2019t enter the atmospherere.The only way we can contribute to it, is through increased CO2, which heats up oceans and increases water vaporization that goes into the atmosphere.Methane is also a strong greenhouse gas, in fact it is 84 times stronger by volume than CO2. However, its concentration is 250 times less than that of CO2 (0.00017% vs 0.04%). That\u2019s why its contribution to climate change is 5 times less than that of CO2 (4% vs. 26%). Secondly, 80% of the Methane disappears from the atmosphere within 25 years on average while it takes 250 years for 80% of the CO2. So, if we reduced Methane emissions drastically, we would already remove most of its greenhouse effect. However, even if we reduced all CO2 emissions drastically right now, we would not see a reduction of the greenhouse effect and experience the entire cascading effect of CO2 for 200 years. That\u2019s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas. Read more about this here. How long do greenhouse gases stay in the air? This chart also shows how much the increase in those greenhouse gases increased their heat trapping.Here, just some more of those arguments that shows just how little effort is put into fact-checking:CO2 is a heavy gas, so it sinks in the atmosphere. - Great, that doesn\u2019t change anything.CO2 lags temperature. - Yes, and as explained, it\u2019s not the only cause of climate change (Milankovitch cycles, solar radiation, volcanic, geological activity), but those all remained unchanged while CO2 increased by 40%.Medival Warming Period - This was not a global phenomenon and a tiny temperature change of 0.2 degrees celcius.The temperature records were faked and temperatures in the past were pushed down and pushed up for the recent years so that it appears that the temperature changes were higher. - If you fact check, it turns out this gif just shows the differences for U.S. temperatures vs. global temperatures.Whither U.S. Climate?It was the sun. - No, the sun\u2019s energy sent to earth decreased during the largest temperature increase during the last 200 years while CO2 increased by 40%. This literally only takes 1 minute to fact-check.You\u2019ve seen that people jump on sound bites like \u201cCO2 is a heavy gas that sinks\u201d, \u201cmedival warm period\u201d, believe blatantly fake data without any doubt or fact-checking. This is the oldest technique in the book of pseudo-science, overwhelming the reader with 50 arguments, using scientific words and it works, so that they think it\u2019s true and don\u2019t fact check them. Summary Earth receives 324 watts/m2 of energy from the sun constantly. Of those 324 watts, a total of 235 watts is absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 107 watts are reflected back into space. Greenhouse gases increase the energy absorption of sunlight by 1.1% directly compared to pre-industrial times and by 3.3% overall due to the cascading effect. This increases total absorbed watts/m2 by 7.2 watts/m2 from 235 watts to 242.3 watts/m2. This effect is not reversible even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes CO2 200 years on average to be reabsorbed by land or by the ocean. We can only try to slow down the cascading effect. All in all, the recent climate change is man-made and these numbers prove it without a doubt.",

You must be American, because the US is the only country in the world in which the pernicious myth of climate change denial holds any weight.

The short version is as follows: NASA won\u2019t tell us if there is already intelligent extraterrestrial life on another planet yet because no one knows if this is or isn\u2019t the case. We\u2019re still searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, but so far we haven\u2019t found even simple extraterrestrial life.

The short version is as follows: NASA won\u2019t tell us if there is already intelligent extraterrestrial life on another planet yet because no one knows if this is or isn\u2019t the case. We\u2019re still searching for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, but so far we haven\u2019t found even simple extraterrestrial life. However, if we do one day discover intelligent aliens, then it is possible that some governments might try to cover it up for various reasons. One reason is scientific skepticism. While there have been many claims of extraterrestrial life, there\u2019s no evidence of its existence yet. With our current technology it\u2019s either undetectable or simply hasn\u2019t been detected yet. Knowing this scientists will tend to be doubtful unless solid evidence is presented to back up the claim and those subsequent findings published in a reputable science publication. This failure to say anything before it\u2019s confirmed and reconfirmed could count as a secret, but if a space agency or government wanted to keep it a secret forever the secret wouldn\u2019t last long. Why is that? Simply because that scientific paper that gets published will not only be studied by other scientists but also by journalists looking for a good space story. There are countless popular science based websites that specialize in writing articles about the latest scientific discoveries, and they would definitely notice and report on a research paper of this nature. After the news of the discovery starts to leak out on these smaller science websites, the big media companies, who monitor these smaller science websites, will catch wind of the story. Reporters will recognize the significance of the news and it will quickly catapult to the most important story of the evening, leading as the first story introduced by the T.V. anchorperson. This will happen even before the discovery has been peer reviewed and confirmed by scientists worldwide. Therefore it would ultimately be unsuccessful for a government to hide information about some random discovery of extraterrestrial life, especially since it won\u2019t be the government that makes the discovery. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence is made up of ordinary people like you and me, both civilians and scientists, governments and astrophysicists, amateur astronomers and professional astronomers and so on. In other words, the people rule when it comes to science, not the governments of the world. It isn\u2019t unreasonable to assume that regimes ruled by extremists and totalitarians might want to conceal any discovery of extraterrestrials from their citizens. I mean, how would you take the news that extraterrestrial life had been discovered if you were teaching people that six thousand years ago God created Earth and there\u2019s no such thing as \u201caliens\u201d from \u201cother planets?\u201d This news could directly contradict the religious teachings of these totalitarian governments, and they might not want people to know about it. Those governm...",

It\u2019s been suggested that Eisenhower met with representatives from another world when he went missing while in Florida, and many say he made a sort of treaty with these aliens regarding their existence and impact on our planet.  Conspiracy theories kick into overtime on this, and some of it makes perfect sense.  Sharing the ability to travel to other planets wouldn\u2019t seem practical, and no one truly knows how the world would react to news about extraterrestrial life\u2026especially if there are many species and we\u2019re low on the hi-tech totem pole.  Some say the Catholic Church is preparing to deal with such a revelation, which might explain the massive observatory they have in Vatican City.  Religion aside, advanced civilizations wouldn\u2019t want to interfere with our natural development, so talking to a few highly placed government figures might be as far as they\u2019ll go\u2026they could be the ones that wish to remain anonymous.  If anyone has heard of the council of nine, they may have heard that Gene Roddenberry was at a meeting, and could have got his idea for the \u2018Prime Directive\u2019 from that encounter.  Just as Spock and Kirk limited their interactions with pre-warp cultures, so it might be that advanced aliens stay in the shadows until a society is enlightened and ready. There\u2019s many theories and opinions on this, but a purely scientific reaction to life might not be up to scientists; the NSA and CIA would claim responsibility, and their paranoid ways would keep this under several rugs.  Discovering and admitting that microbial life was found might be the first step in a long process, and further announcements might depend on how the world reacts to the notion that life is not exclusive to Earth.  Just 300 years ago, church doctrine stipulated that life began in the Garden of Eden, and God created man in His own image on this planet and nowhere else.  Jesus also cryptically left the door open when he said, \u201cI have other sheep that are not of this fold,\u201d a statement that might suggest Earth is one fold, and other folds could be far from Earth.  Just speculation, but great are the mysteries of life, and where that life may be found.",

This is completely wrong \u2014 MOST astronomy is not done by NASA, but rather by scientists and astronomers throughout the world who mostly work for universities, which own their own equipment, or use equipment that NASA launched and maintains. The overwhelming likelihood is that if humans discover evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, the discovery will not be made by a NASA employee. Regardless of who makes the discovery, it will be announced quickly but not instantly. It\u2019s not that anyone wants to cover up anything; it\u2019s that they don\u2019t want to be made to look foolish. The history of science is replete with examples of scientists announcing discoveries, only to find out that they had made some silly mistake. No astronomer wants to announce that they have received a radio signal from an advanced civilization, only to discover that it\u2019s just radio interference from the Burger King down the road. So they will check and re-check their work, to make sure that there is no possible alternate explanation, and then they will announce. The movie Contact, I think, is a pretty accurate representation of how it will go \u2014 at least the discovery itself. After making the discovery, Elle Arroway\u2019s team calls other astronomers to check their work. Once they\u2019ve ruled out other explanations, one of her colleagues asks, \u201cWho we gonna call now?\u201d and Arroway answers, \u201cEverbody.\u201d The idea that NASA or any scientific organization would cover up such a discovery longer than necessary to make sure it\u2019s accurate is moronic. This is what they live for. The discoverers of extraterrestrials would be world-famous, have fabulous careers for life, and have bucket-loads of money thrown at them to research the discovery. The idea that they would instead cover it up because of, ummm, reasons, is idiotic.",

Well, it turns out the Isha Foundation didn't bring their bulldozers and yoga mats to claim forest land. Nope, no encroachment here! And as for the elephant corridor, the Yoga Center is as far from it as a yogi can be from a bag of potato chips during meditation.Now, let's address the notion of forced tribal land acquisition. Sorry, folks, but no land was snatched away in a dramatic Indiana Jones-style adventure. The Isha Foundation respects tribal communities and their rights. Oh, and compliance with laws? You bet! The Isha Foundation plays by the book, following all the rules and regulations, like a yogi gracefully flowing through a sun salutation.Ah, the infamous environmental clearance application withdrawal. It's like sending a love letter to the wrong address. Oops! A simple mistake, not a sinister plot.And man-animal conflict? The Isha Foundation lives in harmony with nature, sharing good vibes and peaceful coexistence with our furry friends. We're all about love and respect here.Now, let's talk about Sadhguru's lifestyle. Sure, he's seen in stylish shawls, coolers, and even on bikes. But guess what? He's not a collector of fancy toys. Sadhguru rides the waves of life with his teachings, not expensive cars or bikes.And those rumors about Sadhguru and celebrities? Well, the media loves a bit of glitz and glamour, but for every celebrity encounter, there are millions of non-celebrity connections happening behind the scenes. The real magic lies in the transformative work happening in rural communities, away from the flashbulbs.Now, let's address the elephant in the room\u2014Mahashivaratri and program costs. Offering a grand celebration like Mahashivaratri to millions of people takes resources and organizing prowess. So, yes, a few folks chip in to keep the divine dance going, while millions enjoy it for free.And expensive programs? Fear not, spiritual seekers! The process itself is free, but the costs go towards organizing these transformative experiences. It's like a cosmic subscription fee to a journey of self-discovery.(Also if you can buy one new dress for your daughter in a year, you for sure can afford an Isha Yoga Program.Are the accusations true? Are Sadhguru and the Isha Foundation guilty as charged? Well, based on the evidence, the truth, and a sprinkle of common sense, it seems those accusations have as much substance as a cloud made of cotton candy. So, let the yoga mats roll, the meditation deepen, and the seekers unite, for Sadhguru and the Isha Foundation continue to inspire and uplift humanity with their work, defying those baseless claims like a warrior in the quest for truth.

There are also other religious groups who have nothing but belief system that drives them, they want to force their beliefs in others and wants to destroys anything that stands in their way. Belief systems can be broken down easily by campaign but people who are enhanced with inner experience can never be broken down by negative campaigns or false allegations. My Experience: In my life, i have never bowed down to anybody, refused to enter temples not even respected elders or my parents for that matter. During that time i saw some people in my locality whom i saw so lowly of because of their worst behavior, suddenly changes so much. In my quest to find the reason for that i have got to know about Sadhguru & Isha. Later i participated in one of the programs conducted in my locality and it was good, i did those yoga for sometime and left. Those programs definitely have a positive impact and its doing a great deal of good to the society. I thought that is all there is, until i had an opportunity to participate in one of his sathsangs in Salem. A huge crowd, lakhs of people came, i was one of them. I was hearing to the answers that he gave for the questions raised by the participants and it was interesting and going good, later some time he told lets have a small meditation. That is when it happened, the instruction was to place your palm upwards with a slightly upturned face and to maintain the concentration between the eyebrows. Before this, he advised not to open the eyes or pay attention to whats happening to others, he also told that this is about us, by paying attention to others we can never perceive whats happening to them & miss ours. Having the beforehand advise carved into my mind, I was sitting with my eyes closed and never bothered of my surroundings. He sang in a peculiar way, suddenly something started happening within me and i allowed it to happen within myself. It felt like current shock surging from my lower stomach to top of my head, tears rolling down like anything and this experience continued for a while and felt other worldly. After my eyes opened i was asking all sorts of questions to myself like what just happened? I didn\u2019t do a thing except sitting simply there, Is it possible for a single person to shake lakhs of people in front of him and making them experience something overwhelming. I was not able to logically come to terms with what just happened there. My perspective of him totally changed and i realized he is such a rare being who we cannot dismiss. So in another occasion a participant asked, Sadhguru though you look like us, eat like us somehow we can see that you are something more (The question which i had). When will you show your true face? His Answer: No matter what what kind of image i chose to project myself to work with the world, some people will anyway perceive or take it wrongly. So I have chosen an image whichever is of least of possibilities. He also stated that, \u201cMy mission is not to make you super human but to make you realize the immensity of being human\u201d. Now, all that i have stated here is my own personal experience, it is not that the same thing will happen to you during your encounter with him. Though i have huge respect for him, I am not a regular doer of yoga or a follower, but i cant keep quiet with fools who runs negative campaigns without knowing a thing. People questioning his attire, driving cars and helicopters which not compared with past saints. This is of absolute ignorance, you think every saint to only wear a loin cloth, to address a mass gathering of people from various countries in UN. There are things that needs to be done to work with the world. If only you are hit with a experience without being able to logically decode people will come to know. One last thing. He\u2019s not gonna be around for ever and he\u2019s already old, don\u2019t waste your energy to abuse him, he wont be affected of it instead enhance your energy by making use of his presence. All the recent happenings make me want to continue my yogic practices, i will definitely find the answer to the experience which i had years back. One thing is sure, there is not another person like him, a human being of enormous proportions. People who wants to read answers and articles, go and pursue the truth with your own experience. Reading will never clear your doubts until you see it for yourself. As i previously mentioned those belief driven people are the dangerous ones and they will go to any lengths to deny you of the possibility that is offered in the name of Isha. They are also the ones who posts cooked up fake stories here to distort you. Good Luck hunting spiritual experience !!",

People said, Sadhguru is brainwashing everyone to take advantageSadhguru very much loved his wife and daughter. They loved him very much. There is not one bit of evidence against Sadhguru. But people have been claiming he killed his wife. Despite seeing that his own daughter does not believe such a thing happenedSadhguru married his wife (who was from a different caste than his own) against the wishes of his family and all relatives. He has been silently trying to break down the caste barriers that separated people from thousands of years. But lately some people are alleging that Sadhguru is in favor of caste systemSadhguru tries to raise funds to do social programs. People claim he is a fraud who is interested only in money.Sadhguru tried to do Rally for Rivers to help restore the rivers in India. People claimed he is getting into controlling water and water selling business.Sadhguru started schools that actually helps students in building their body, mind and positive attitude towards life as a whole. People claimed - he is corrupting children\u2019s mindsSadhguru actually paid four times the price of market price for the ashram land to build Dhyana Linga. But people claimed he stole tribal land.Sadhguru blocked a road that was used by loggers to cut down trees. People claimed he is stealing herbal plants collected by Tribal people and also cut down trees on the hills behind the ashram.Sadhguru teaches various practices to make people strong and healthy. People claimed he is stealing body parts and selling them to make profit.Sadhguru tries to get people to take responsibility for their destiny and avoid dependency on scriptures, astrology and philosophy. People claim he is anti-Hindu.Sadhguru is trying to stop conversions of Hindus into other faiths but people claim Sadhguru is working to destroy Hinduism in IndiaSadhguru goes around the world trying to promote Kriya Yoga based tools and techniques to improve quality of life and well-being of every human. People claim Sadhguru is an attention seeker and a total fraud.When anyone practices Kriya Yoga or Hatha Yoga for a sustained period of time, they will become very perceptive, highly aware and very sensitive. Practitioners can sense, feel and access things / information that is not generally accessible to others. When Sadhguru mentions about things he has perceived within him or the effects of solar and lunar cycles on human body - immediately the learned jump on him and call Sadhguru - a pseudo-scientist!! (The irony is, these intellectuals should be asking, how can they also access that same information that Sadhguru is talking about or how can we devise experiments to capture, prove or disprove things he is talking about; these so called intellectuals are absolutely neither curious nor interested in expanding their knowledge and awareness)Sadhguru sets up processes to support people who want to become monks to work on their spiritual practices full time. These people are seeking salvation or ultimate freedom that has been sought for thousands of years in India. People claimed Sadhguru is practicing slavery. Good Heavens!! THAT IS EXACT OPPOSITE of what he is doing\u2026!!!The list can go on but you can clearly see the pattern for yourself.\u2026There is no consequence for people who make false allegations in the system. That is the reason, people are able to put up this nonsense for past 25 years or so. If the same thing happened here in USA, they can be sued out of their existence.The other common allegation is about Isha Practices. Sadhguru openly said that he learned Anga Mardhana from Sri Malladi Halli Swami in Karnataka. Sadhguru gave him due credit for that in his talks and in his autobiography book: Sadhguru - More Than Life. All the other practices are not stolen from some other organizations as people claim. Even though Sadhguru worked for another organization before starting Isha, he mostly saw what is not to be done to transmit yoga as a living experience. There are literally dozens of practices in Isha. Most of them are not available to general public. None of them are from the other organization that Sadhguru worked for. People can jump up and down as much as they want - but the truth is, General Population is not mature enough to understand the ways of a TRUE Kriya Yogi. Sadhguru is more like a mechanic who can put together various tools and technologies to achieve an outcome that is beneficial for the society. His sole focus is only making something work for the well-being of the whole world. Sadhguru is least interested in being liked or accepted by all. Hope people of India wake up and see the possibilities and opportunities that Sadhguru brings to the planet. Even if you don\u2019t agree with Sadhguru or like him for who he is - at least learn a yoga practice somewhere else and avoid getting sick. At least that much every person must do in their life; given how bad the environment is becoming. There are quite a few people \u2014- with least amount of background in Science and Engineering, who criticize Sadhguru using their favorite word: pseudoscience. For them, \u2014- I have a small reading assignment\u2026.

This first came to my attention when a student asked me in class whether I believed we really landed on the moon. I was thrown for a loop by the question; up to that point, I thought only tinfoil hat-wearing nuts believed stuff like that. The student in question wasn\u2019t a bad student, and she was asking seriously. I later relayed this to another class (without using the student\u2019s name) when I taught on the same subject a semester later; I was expecting the class to share my surprise at the question. After class, however, another student came up to me and started to lay out the basic arguments of the lunar landing conspiracy theory as though they were true. Some time after that, I was teaching back-to-back sections of the same U.S. history course. When we got to the Kennedy assassination, a student raised his hand and told me that there was definitely a shooter on the grassy knoll, and that \u201cwe now know his name,\u201d claiming he was a former CIA agent who admitted his role on his death bed. He even gave me a name. In the second section of the class, which met 80 minutes after the first, I was teaching on the same topic, and a different student told me that \u201cwe\u201d now know for a fact that there was a shooter on the grassy knoll; he told me his name and backstory and how this \u201ctruth\u201d came out, but it was a completely different person and completely different story than the first student. This got me interested in how and why people believe in conspiracy theories, and how they shape our understanding of historical events. I put together a class on the topic, which I have taught a total of three times over the past few years and hope to teach again in the not-too-distant future. In order to teach the class, however, I had to immerse myself in a lot of the scholarly literature on conspiracy theories. And there\u2019s a lot. Here\u2019s what I learned. First, belief in conspiracy theories is pretty widespread. Many people believe some conspiracy theories. Most people who believe them are not crazy, and they do not believe all conspiracy theories. Someone can believe one conspiracy theory and think that people who believe different, unrelated theories are nuts. For example, you might easily believe in JFK assassination conspiracy theories while thinking people who believe the moon landing was faked are nuts. Second, there ARE some real conspiracies. There are examples of the government or powerful people doing bad things, and these bad actions that are true make people more disposed toward believing other conspiracy theories; if the government did something bad in the past that was proven true, then the conspiracy theory you believe in might just be another bad thing that has not yet been proven. It is also important to understand that sometimes, people in power will try to cover up their misdeeds by casting any accusations as just the ramblings of crazy, tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorists. Sometimes the people in the tinfoil hats are actually right, and the label \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d can be dismissive in ways that are harmful. Third, people are more inclined to believe in conspiracy theories when they feel powerless or vulnerable. This is true in politics, and it\u2019s true of people from all political perspectives and backgrounds. Two political scientists, Joseph Uscinski and Joseph Parent, in their book American Conspiracy Theories, American Conspiracy Theories: Joseph E. Uscinski, Joseph M. Parent: 9780199351817: Amazon.com: Books found that conspiracy theories are not more common on either the right or the left; they are more common on whichever side is out of power at the moment. During the Obama years we saw an increase in right-wing conspiracy theories (like the Birther nonsense) because the right was the side feeling threatened and out of power. But during the Bush years, we saw an increase in left-wing conspiracy theories, such as the 9/11 Truthers. Being that we are now in a time of Republican control of government in the U.S., we should expect to see an increase in conspiracy theories on the left (and a corresponding condemnation of them on the right.) That this pattern holds up over time is pretty important to understand; neither \u201cside\u201d is more crazy or conspiratorial than the other. Uscinski and Parent, for example, found in their research that typically, around 20% of the population thinks that any election in which their party or chosen candidate lost must have been stolen in some way. This is true of every election, regardless of which party or candidate wins. There are always some people who believe if their \u201cside\u201d or candidate lost, it can only be because the other side cheated. Fourth, part of the appeal of conspiracy theories is that they help to impose order on a chaotic world. There is a natural human tendency known as \u201capophenia\u201d, sometimes also called \u201cpatternicity\u201d. This is the tendency to see patterns where none exist; to see evidence of connections between random events because our brains want the world to be orderly and sensible. If some random guy can hide out in a book depository and shoot the President of the United States just because he\u2019s crazy, well, that\u2019s random. It\u2019s nonsensical. Our brains don\u2019t like that. But if there was a carefully orchestrated plot by shadowy figures who have something to gain by the President\u2019s death, well, THAT is a pattern. Patterns make sense. Our brains like patterns. So we see them, even when they are not really there. Fifth, another part of the appeal of conspiracy theories is the sense of empowerment that comes from being \u201cin the know.\u201d If you look at Quora on some of the questions and comments on the moon landing conspiracy theories, you\u2019ll see this in action. Some people who believe in the conspiracy theory are quick to call those who offer evidence debunking it as fools who have the wool pulled over their eyes by the powerful. They are \u201csheeple,\u201d they are sleepwalking through life, while the people who know \u201cthe truth\u201d that the whole thing was \u201cfake\u201d are the only awake ones, the only ones with their eyes open. This can be a very empowering feeling, which is part of why diehard conspiracy theorists will generally not be persuaded by evidence against them. They WANT to be the only ones awake. They like how that feels. And finally, all people, to one degree or another, have a tendency to accept information that reinforces previously held beliefs, while ignoring or rejecting information that challenges those beliefs. This is called confirmation bias, and everyone does it to one degree or another. If you already believe, for example, that the government cannot be trusted, then it\u2019s easy to accept evidence that, say, the CIA killed Kennedy, or the moon landing was faked. And once you make those conspiracy theories part of your belief system, evidence disproving them just rolls right off you\u2026 but anything you encounter which supports your belief, no matter how dubious it may seem to a nonbeliever, will be accepted noncritically. None of this is \u201cpsychotic\u201d. In fact, it\u2019s fairly normal human psychology. Patternicity, confirmation bias, the appeal of possessing \u201csecret\u201d information that no one else has, the desire to ascribe the victories of your political opponents to cheating and corruption rather than more people simply choosing their side and rejecting yours\u2026 this isn\u2019t so much about wish fulfillment, and it isn\u2019t, by itself, evidence of a mental disorder or psychopathy. There\u2019s been some research on why some people are more likely than others to accept conspiracy theories, and to believe in lots of them. But that same research shows that there\u2019s at least a little conspiracy theorist in, if not all of us, then most of us.",
            "No, a conspiracy theory is more like modern folklore. So saying that 9/11 was done by the US Government, or that the Iraq War is a conspiracy to get oil, are both really just expressions of how people experienced what happened culturally. Not just how they saw the events themselves, or with respect to hard fact, but how the whole cloud of events felt like and seems like to some. The conspiracies sort of put those experiences into narrative and give them structure, and there are varying levels of conspiracy, depending on how much or how deeply a person abstracts and is moved by that. So for examContinue ReadingNo, a conspiracy theory is more like modern folklore. So saying that 9/11 was done by the US Government, or that the Iraq War is a conspiracy to get oil, are both really just expressions of how people experienced what happened culturally. Not just how they saw the events themselves, or with respect to hard fact, but how the whole cloud of events felt like and seems like to some. The conspiracies sort of put those experiences into narrative and give them structure, and there are varying levels of conspiracy, depending on how much or how deeply a person abstracts and is moved by that. So for example, some people go so far to believe that alien lizards are behind 9/11 in a conspiracy going back centuries, or more. That\u2019s a way of putting into words a sense that people in government and industry act as if they\u2019re alien; that is, are totally unidentifiable. In what way? Look and see what they\u2019re saying. They don\u2019t seem human, or warm-blooded, or native to the Earth to those individuals. The conspiracy story is just a collection of symbols and a narrative from that perspective. Is that very much different than saying governments/industries are psychopathic and don\u2019t seem concerned with the Earth? It\u2019s just a different way of framing that. In other time, the leadership might be considered to be making deals with devils from another place, or to be possessed. The leaders played along and claimed to be incarnate gods sometimes, or to have encountered the divine, just like our leaders today might belong to some cool fraternity like Skulls & Bones or something. We think less in high fantasy and more sci-fi now adays because Mt. Olympus is a lot higher, just because of our toys, so it\u2019s secret societies and alien lizards instead of malevolent super wizards in our most grandiose stories around these giga-campfires. I\u2019m sure in prehistoric times, the elders were sometimes considered to have been secretly skinned and eaten by a wild boar during a hunt, who now wears their flesh like they\u2019d wear an animal skin, and that the elder is actually a brutal vindictive pig in disguise. Or maybe a benevolent pig who enjoys life with mankind. Sometimes, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d even squeal and snort with laughter\u2026 on purpose! That\u2019s what\u2019s up.",

Nixon\u2019s most famous repeated campaign slogan was \u201cI have a secret peace plan\u201d and \u201cI will end this war.\u201d Then, came the Paris Peace Talks, and rumors were that everything was all set, and the horrible war would finally end. Then, a surprise walk-out\u2014 a huge worldwide surprise. By South Vietnam (!) On the second day, as the conference was just getting underway after a celebratory party / banquet the night before. The Paris Peace Talks came to an end\u2026 Nobody could explain exactly why\u2026. one of the major players suddenly got up, and walked out of the room, and flew out of the country \u2014 less than 90 seconds after they had walked in\u2026 A mystery, reported on the front page of nearly every newspaper on the planet. The War ravaged on, through 1968, 1969, 1970, and 1971, and 1972, and 1973, and 1974, until April of 1975. The U.S. Evacuation. Tens of thousands of additional deaths\u2026 The escalation, and the most brutal losses of US troops occurred during those years after the Paris Peace Talks, by far. In 1968, (I remember this well), there were \u201crumors\u201d and \u201ccharges\u201d and lots of outrage and a conspiracy theory that it was Richard Nixon\u2019s campaign who had somehow convinced South Vietnam to walk out of the Paris Peace Talks. There was no proof. Not at that time. An accusation, without any evidence, is a conspiracy theory. That is the definition, in fact. No evidence. Just an accusation. A suspicion. Those rumors and conspiracy theories continued, non-stop, Suspicions, but never any evidence. They continued, for years, while Nixon was in office. Until Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation over a different issue. Watergate. Not an act of treason, but a different series of crimes. Meanwhile, many American soldiers died, and died, and died, as the war raged on. Two of my neighbors \u2014 and one friend. Then, after the U.S. withdrawal in 1975, it was largely forgotten. It was a very old conspiracy theory. Nixon was no longer in office. Time had passed. We all knew Nixon was a criminal, and a felon, and corrupt, but he could no longer do any damage. A conspiracy theory. By definition, that means an accusation, without any real evidence. Yawn. Yes, Richard Nixon committed criminal acts, the entire planet knew that. But \u201ctreason?\u201d An act punishable by death? Treason? No way\u2026 Treason, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, because he had conspired against his own government? No way\u2026 Republicans scoffed\u2026. It was like all the other conspiracy theories which have no merit, Roswell, Loch Ness, the Flat Earth theory, the \u201cfaked moon landing,\u201d and \u201cBigfoot\u201d and \u201caliens from outer space are stored at Area 51!\u201d and \u201cElvis is still alive\u2026.\u201d and then \u201c9/11 was an inside plot,\u201d and, ad nauseam. Ugh. Then, in 2017 \u2014 the handwritten notes of his top aid were released, upon his death \u2014 and it turns out that this \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d was not a theory. It was very real, and Nixon had ordered his top aid to pick up the phone, and to sabotage a peace plan, by telling fibs to the South Vietnamese Government. Nixon (and his top aid and Chief of Staff) had instructed a foreign government what to do, so that a war would still be going on, to ensure his voters that they should vote for the \u201conly man who could end the War In Vietnam.\u201d [Once in office, in 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, a973, and in 1974, Nixon found that he could not end the war that he had decided to prolong. In the usual irony, Nixon discovered that he could not end the war that he had actually prolonged, once he prolonged it.] History has so many lovely ironies. Nixon left office while Americans continued to die in Vietnam. Note \u2014 a reminder \u2014 even worse \u2014 back at the time of this treasonous act \u2014 in 1968 \u2014 Richard Nixon was a private citizen, just the same as you, or I. Nixon did not even hold any office in 1968. He had no business discussing American policy and diplomatic solutions or American foreign policy or a war with the top members of any foreign government. He had no business conspiring with a foreign government against the government of the United States of America, which had successfully brokered and negotiated an end to a long, long war. In 1968, Richard Nixon was merely a private person, running for a political office, who did not want to lose the one campaign strategy that appeared to be working, according to all of the polls. TREASON \u2014 (1) \u201clevying war\u201d against the United States; or (2) \u201cadhering to [the] enemies [of the United States], giving them aid and comfort.\u201d Those orders to H. R. Haldeman were directed to call seven different people, including the President of South Vietnam, all of which resulted in \u201clevying war\u201d against the United States; and, all seven phone calls, also definitely were instances of \u201cadhering to [the] enemies [of the United States], giving them aid and comfort.\u201d Treason \u2014 often considered by most the worst crime any American can commit. H.R. Haldeman\u2019s handwritten notes detailed what he was ordered to do, and he detailed each and every detail of when he picked up the phone, on seven occasions, and how he convinced a foreign government to walk out on the official signing of the Paris Peace Talks. We finally learned the truth, four years ago - in 2017. Haldeman left VERY detailed notes, and they spelled out exactly what he did, and also his discussions where Nixon told him what to do, in great detail. Some 38 to 39 years later, Haldeman had died, and all of his notes and diaries and calendars became public, around New Year\u2019s Eve, of 2017.Addendum \u2013 [IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are reading this response on a \u201cmonetized\u201d space \u2013 or a \u201cpaid\u201d space \u2013 then you are being ripped off.

But you might find some significant differences in the type of delusions people have due to specific psychiatric disorders. There are some physical or non-psychiatric disorders that can cause delusions. For example, some forms of dementia can cause paranoia. Brain tumors, rarely, will cause paranoia. Some people become delusional when they use certain street drugs or alcohol. In some cases (not all), street drugs or alcohol could simply worsen an existing psychiatric illness. There are only a few prescription drugs that can bring about (or worsen) delusional thinking. L-Dopa, for Parkinson\u2019s Disease, is an example. It makes dopamine more active. Stimulant drugs are notorious for causing or worsening delusional thinking. For example, an \u2018old style\u2019 stimulant-type drug for ADHD caused a friend with emerging schizophrenia to become more delusional. Cocaine, PCP, Meth and some other street drugs can cause delusional thinking as well. It can be quite difficult to determine if a person has a more brief psychotic illness, like Brief Psychotic Disorder or Schizophreniform Disorder*, or if he or she simply got drunk or high. In fact, people often wind up in the emergency department of a hospital, high or drunk, severely paranoid and delusional. A street drug or alcohol might have caused this entirely, in which case the symptoms would usually clear up rapidly as the effects of the drug or alcohol wear off. In most cases, if symptoms linger, a smart doctor will start to wonder if the person has a psychiatric illness of some type. Always remember that about 20% of people who go to a hospital for depression (obviously this is going to be more severe depression), have psychotic symptoms like hallucinations (\u2018seeing things\u2019 or \u2018hearing things\u2019) and delusions. So in fact, yes, delusions can be a part of more severe depression. Keep in mind that the delusions that come with depression are usually \u2018mood congruent,\u2019 which means that these delusions are on topics like guilt, shame and sadness. For example, a friend with severe depression was \u2018convinced\u2019 that he had murdered someone. He had not. If the depression were even more severe, the person might believe he was harming the whole human race just by existing, or had caused a worldwide war. A friend who eventually committed suicide and had extremely severe depression, had the delusion that he had harmed someone and \u2018could no longer live, knowing that.\u2019 In fact he had not harmed anyone in such a terrible way. Some people will get delusions with Bipolar Disorder. So that is yet another possibility. These delusions could occur during the \u2018down\u2019 phase of Bipolar, or the \u2018Up\u2019 (manic) phase. Delusions with Bipolar can cause people to be \u2018angry\u2019, \u2018irritable\u2019 or \u2018overly sensitive\u2019 during the \u2018down\u2019 phase. This type of anger is called \u2018hostility\u2019 because it\u2019s due to psychotic symptoms like delusions. And we also know that delusions can occur duringperiods of mania. These delusions can be particularly dangerous. The delusions of mania could lead a person to injure himself. He may believe he can fly or that he can give away all his money because he is infinitely wealthy. He may not \u2018believe\u2019 he needs to eat or drink, or that he can run for miles without harm. A person can have delusions because of Delusional Disorder(used to be called \u2018Paranoid Disorder\u2019). This is a disorder in which the person is likely to only be impaired or dysfunctional in one area of his life. For example, my friend\u2019s husband was able to show up each day and do fairly well at a routine job. But when he went home - wow. He was screaming at her, accusing her of sleeping with hundreds of men. She often had to retreat to her room with their son and lock her door while he screamed, kicked and spit at the door. He didn\u2019t take any prescription drugs, street drugs or alcohol that could account for such behavior. And in fact, belief in a partner cheating is a common pattern with Delusional Disorder. With delusional disorder the delusions are called \u2018non-bizarre,\u2019 because these are things that are unlikely to happen, but not impossible. It\u2019s worth spending a moment on this concept of \u2018non-bizarre\u2019 and \u2018bizarre\u2019 delusions. Examples usually make this more clear. So I knew a man who was \u2018convinced\u2019 he had a rare tropical disease. That doesn\u2019t even seem \u2018odd\u2019 until you know a little more - like that he had spent thousands of dollars seeing doctors, each of whom told him he did not have any such disease. In fact, he saw over 85 different doctors within two years, ALL of whom told him he was not ill. And he did not \u2018believe\u2019 any of them. So despite his lengthy and irrational search for \u2018a doctor who knows about this rare disease,\u2019 this is a non-bizarre delusion. Bizarre delusions are typically a part of Schizophrenia. Bizarre delusions are delusions that are so unlikely as to be considered impossible. For example, a friend\u2019s son started out believing the IRS was after him. Well, said his mom, the IRS is after all of us. But within a few months, the IRS had become invisible space monsters that implanted a camera behind his eye and were broadcasting his thoughts to the world\u2019s religious leaders. Paranoid Personality Disorder is also a possible cause of delusions. It often takes a psychiatrist to figure out if a person has Delusional Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder\u2026or the next illness. Most lay people miss important behavior patterns and symptoms and have a very tough time differentiating between these several disorders. And yes, a common cause of delusions is Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia probably affects about 1% of any large human population. While delusions of schizophrenia often start out \u2018non-bizarre,\u2019 they tend to become increasingly bizarre as time goes on. This could occur within a few months, or it might take years. It may even appear to clear up for a few years and then come back. Keep in mind that some people with schizophrenia may not trust anyone enough to share all the details of their delusion. So in fact, many people will assume a person who actually has schizophrenia, \u2018just\u2019 has Delusional Disorder. The person may simply be too suspicious of everyone to discuss all aspects of the delusion. Keep in mind that symptoms can also clear up for months or years, and then come back even worse than before. Keep in mind that medication could lessen delusions - until the person\u2019s illness worsens or he stops taking his medication. SO\u2026THEN\u2026What about all the people who believe conspiracy theories but are not diagnosed - or even diagnosable - with any psychiatric illness? Well, those people are tougher to think about. Certainly, some of these people are mentally ill and just not diagnosed. Others are \u2018a little bit mentally ill.\u2019 Their thinking is not entirely rational, some of their decisions are very unwise, but they seem to somehow get through every day, show up for work, dress neatly, and so on. But what about people who don\u2019t appear to be mentally ill at all? Rational, sensible folks in most ways, but they believe things that are amply proven to be untrue. What\u2019s up with them? Well, what many researchers say is that many, even most, people, do not decide what to believe by a rational process. Emotion comes into it, and \u2018people believe what they want to believe.\u2019 There are quite a few researchers who have simply declared that people as a whole do not make \u2018rational decisions.\u2019 Critical thinking skills can help. Most people are very \u2018sloppy\u2019 when it comes to these skills. They believe what they want to believe, and people who agree with them are \u2018using good critical thinking skills,\u2019 and people who disagree with them are \u2018nuts,\u2019 \u2018messed up,\u2019 \u2018irrational,\u2019 and \u2018stupid.\u2019 *Schizophreniform Disorder is \u2018the most unstable diagnosis.\u2019 Some studies have found that over 90% of people diagnosed with Schizophreniform Disorder will eventually \u2018transition\u2019 to Schizophrenia."

Yet the ERE was the real superpower of the MEditerranean during the Dark Ages, its only real life rivals were Tang China and Gupta India, Constantinople was alternatively the largest or second largest city in the world during the Dark Ages, and the Empire formed the bulwark of Christendom during the Arab and Turkish onslaughts.

That, anyway, seemed to be the outlook of historian James Hurley and pilot Joseph Hays when, in 1968, they flew a plane over Brooklyn, , not only looking outside the box, but above it.[1] They were looking for the remnants of a village founded 130 years earlier, the free Black community of Weeksville. Here is the history of Weeksville and the efforts to preserve Brooklyn's forgotten African American community. At the turn of the 19th century, the city of Brooklyn was known as the \u201cslaveholding capital\u201d of New York State and was home to the highest concentration of enslaved people north of the Mason-Dixon Line.[2] But, after New York State abolished slavery in 1827[3] , free black professionals bought land in what is now Crown Heights and founded Weeksville, a self-supporting community of African American Freedman, which grew to become the second-largest free black community in Antebellum America.[4] By 1855, over 520 free African Americans lived in Weeksville, including some of the leading activists in the Abolitionist and Equal Suffrage movements.[5]1839 deed of Sale for land in Brooklyn\u2019s 9th Ward, which became Weeksville (Brooklyn Historical Society) Weeksville was carved out of central Brooklyn when the Panic of 1837 moved wealthy landowners in the area to start liquidating their holdings.[6] Abolitionist and black community leader Henry C. Thompson, a free African American and land investor, purchased 32 lots from Edward Copeland, a politically minded European American and Brooklyn grocer, who in 1835, bought the land from an heir of John Lefferts.[7] By the time the Revolutionary War began, most of Central Brooklyn belonged to the Bedford branch of the Lefferts family, who were among the largest landowners, and slaveholders, in Kings County.[8] There was ample opportunity for land acquisition during this time, as many prominent land-holding families sold off their properties during an intense era of land speculation.[9] Thompson began selling those plots to other free black Brooklynites, including James Weeks, who purchased two plots in 1838, built a home near what is now Schenctady Avenue and Dean Street, and lived in the community that bears his name.[10] Weeksville grew until its borders ran approximately to what are now East New York, Ralph, Troy, and Atlantic Avenues.Sylvanus Smith, one of Weeksville\u2019s original founders circa 1870 (Sylvanus Smith (1831\u20131911) \u2022) James Weeks, Sylvanus Smith, and the other original founders of Weeksville intentionally created a community, nestled among the slopes and valleys of Bedford Hills, that was geographically separate from the rest of Brooklyn. The seclusion helped ensure that community members would be safe and that Weeksville residents would have access to education, economic self-sufficiency, and political self-determination.[11] For free blacks in early 19th century New York, political self-determination and voting rights were directly tied to land ownership. In 1821, the New York State Constitution widened the franchise to include all white men regardless of whether they owned property but established a $250 property requirement for black men.[12]Weeksville was the answer: a community of free black landowners. In addition to several landowners from Africa, almost 40 percent of residents were southern-born.[13] Nearly one-third of the men over 21 owned land.Colored School No. 2 (PS 68) (the Brooklyn Historical Society) Weeksville not only boasted the highest rate of property and business ownership in any African American urban community at the time, but also the community supported the nation\u2019s first African American newspaper, the Freedman\u2019s Torchlight,[14] with a 93 percent literacy rate, they were more educated than their caucasian counterparts.[15] The community built Colored School No. 2, which, after the Civil War, became PS 68, the first integrated school in the country.[16] Other cultural organizations included the Aged; Howard Colored Orphan Asylum; Berean Baptist Church; Bethel A.M.E. Church; and the Citizens Union Cemetery.[17] Henry Highland Garnet founded the African Civilization Society (ACS) in 1858, with the intention of encouraging blacks Americans to emigrate to Africa.[18] Garnet envisioned educated black Americans moving to the African Continent as cultural missionaries to lead the economic, political, and moral development of the various indigenous peoples. Residents were moved by the idea of a free black colony in Liberia because Weeksville was founded during the Back to Africa Movement, which has been called the \u201cgolden age\u201d of Black Nationalism.[19] While some Weeksville residents, including the clergymen Henry Highland Garnet and T. McCants Stewart,[20] did emigrate to Liberia, most of the community\u2019s efforts regarding freedom, emancipation, education, and self-determination played out closer to home.First Edition The Freedman's Torchlight (The Freedman and The Freedman's Torchlight : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive) For example, according to a notice, published by the African Civilization Society in 1866:The Freedman\u2019s Torchlight was \u201cdevoted to the temporal and spiritual interests of the Freedman, and adapted to their present need of instruction in regard to simple truths and principles relating to their life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.\u201d[21]The paper contained reading lessons that were used to teach literacy to members of the community who had been denied that training under slavery.[22] Weeksville not only offered more opportunities for education, employment and political enfranchisement for African Americans than anywhere else in Brooklyn, but also the community functioned as one of the principal safe havens for black New Yorkers threatened by the 1863 draft riots.[23]New York\u2019s black community was targeted during the city\u2019s 1863 draft riots (the Tenement Museum) When opposition to the Civil War prompted Irish New Yorkers to target African Americans during bloody violence that bested the city\u2019s police forces, and could only be broken by the arrival of Union Soldiers.[24] Working-class Irish immigrants had suffered inflation, food shortages, and virulent discrimination and unemployment[25] ; but the match that touched off the powder keg was a set of new Draft Laws which took effect on July 11th. The Draft Laws stated that stated that all single men (including immigrants who had filed for citizenship) between the ages of twenty and forty-five and all married men between twenty and thirty-five could be called upon to fight the ongoing Civil War on behalf of the Union Army.[26] Another statute of the Act stated that if a man could afford to pay $300, he could hire a substitute to be drafted in the wealthy man\u2019s place.[27] Weeksville residents provided a haven for other New Yorkers. The Colored Orphan\u2019s Asylum on West 44th Street was set afire, but thankfully all 237 children inside escaped safely.[28] At least eleven African American men were murdered during the three day riot, and fear of continued violence ultimately contributed to a 20% decrease in the African American population of New York City during the Civil War.[29] The community\u2019s focus on both self-determination and social justice for other African Americans made Weeksville home to extraordinary pioneers and community leaders. For example, Junius C. Morel was principal of Colored School No. 2, and also a nationally recognized journalist, who wrote for the Colored American, North Star, Frederick Douglass\u2019 Paper, and Christian Recorder.[30] In his writing, he advocated for both African American independence and racial and gender integration in public schools.Sarah Smith Garnet was one of Sylvanus Smith\u2019s daughters.(Susan Smith McKinney Steward, M.D., '1870 (1847-1918)) The women of Weeksville were also some of the most accomplished women in the country. For example, Susan Smith McKinney Steward became the first African American female doctor in New York State[31] , and her sister, Sarah Smith Tompkins Garner, became Brooklyn\u2019s first female school principal[32] and was the founder of the Equal Suffrage League of Brooklyn, the first suffrage organization founded by and for black women.[33] Together, both sisters founded the Women\u2019s Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn, another black women\u2019s suffrage organization. According to Judith Wellman\u2019s Brooklyn\u2019s Promised Land, in 1850, 9.5 percent of Weeksville residents were property owners, double the rate of greater Brooklyn\u2019s population.[34] Many of these holdings included small farms, where locals raised hogs and grew potatoes, corn, vegetables, and melons, some of which they likely sold in the bustling markets of far-off Manhattan. Residents supplemented their diets with foraged nuts and berries, and supplies from local grocery stores, several of which were black-owned.[35]This tintype, of the \u201cWeeksville Lady,\u201d was found as part of excavations of the Weeksville site. We don\u2019t know much about her, except that she was likely a prominent member of her community. (COURTESY OF WEEKSVILLE HERITAGE CENTER) The community thrived and grew throughout the 19th century, but, by the 1880s, Brooklyn had grown up around Weeksville, and it ceased to be secluded. Instead, Eastern Parkway came roaring through town, and residents began to disperse.[36] By the 1930s, an influx of European immigrants and Brooklyn\u2019s expanding city grid consumed the enclave of Weeksville, which became largely forgotten. Then came an airplane. In 1968, Pratt researchers James Hurley and Joseph Hays found references to Weeksville in 19th century histories of Brooklyn.[37] Hurley was a historian, and Hays was a pilot. Soaring over the sprawling city, they spotted a historic blip in the grid of brick and asphalt: four structures from the original Weeksville. Constructed between 1840 and 1880 as one- and two-story homes, they had originally faced Hunterfly Road, a Native American trail converted into a village lane.[38] Archaeologists and activists immediately set to work excavating the structures, which they dubbed the Hunterfly Road Houses. The homes are the oldest standing structures in Bed-Stuy and Crown Heights, and are the only homes left that were part of Weeksville.[39]1970s era community preservation project (via the Weeksville Heritage Center) Hurley and Hays began a campaign against time to save the homes, for the area had been targeted for a host of urban renewal projects. In 1969, Bed-Stuy resident Joan Maynard created the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville[40] and Bedford Stuyvesant History in order to discover and preserve Weeksville\u2019s past and to restore the Hunterfly Road Houses. The Hunterfly Road Houses were designated New York City Landmarks in 1970, and after all four were added to the National Register of Historic Places, the Society purchased the houses in 1973 .[41] More than twenty years later, the Weeksville Heritage Cente. opened in 2005. In 2014, the Center expanded, adding a new, modern building. Today, the Weeksville Heritage Center offers tours, public programs, and research facilities to \u201cdocument, preserve and interpret the history of free African American communities in Weeksville, Brooklyn and beyond.\u201d[42] The Weeksville Heritage Center remains a hub of Black cultural life. Now, in keeping with Weeksville\u2019s legacy of culinary self-determination, Heritage Center staff have turned their attention toward Central Brooklyn\u2019s contemporary food scene. As part of a project called Meals as Collective Memory, [43] Weeksville staff and consultants have interviewed dozens of local Black restaurant owners, with the aim of creating a \u201cliving archive\u201d of food in a changing Brooklyn.[44] The idea is that local, black-owned restaurants are the heirs of Weeksville\u2019s legacy, and their efforts deserve documentation and support.A community dinner to celebrate the \"Meals as Collective Memory\" project at Weeksville Heritage Center (The Culinary Legacy of Brooklyn's First Free Black Community) Footnotes[1] The history of Weeksville: When Crown Heights had the second-largest free black community in the U.S. | 6sqft[2] John Jay's new database provides 35,000+ records of slavery in New York | 6sqft[3] New-York Historical Society[4] Before NYC's Slave Market, Freedmen from Africa Were Allowed to Own Farmland  | 6sqft[5] Beyond the Village and Back: Historic Weeksville, Brooklyn - GVSHP | Preservation | Off the Grid[6] Panic of 1837 | Armstrong Economics[7] http://Wellman, J.

Seeing a potential ally Genghis sent a large caravan of Mongol merchants to the powerful Khwarezmian Empire in Persia. However, when they arrive the traders were accused of espionage and had their goods confiscated and were then executed. When Genghis sent envoys to the Khwarezmians offering a chance to make amends by handing over the Governor responsible for the executions. The Shah of the empire Ala ad-Din Muhammad had one of these envoys killed and the other two shaved and humiliated.Genghis Khan was so furious he abandoned his war with China and amassed an army of over 100,000 and invaded the Khwarezmian empire in 1219. The Mongol army divided into sub groups and annihilated the Khwarezmians in a rapid campaign of destruction. The Shah was forced to flee the empire and many major cities including the capital city of Samarqand were destroyed. The Mongols killed as many as 4 million people in this conquest with the Governor involved in the executions of the merchants having molten silver poured into his eyes.Still not entirely satisfied in 1221 Genghis had his Generals wipe the Shahs birthplace the city of Gurganj off the map by breaking a dam and diverting a river through the city. The survivors of the flood were butchered in one of the bloodiest massacres in history, with only the artisans and craftsman spared and sent back to Mongolia to be slaves. It only took Genghis Khan two years to conquer the Khwarezmian empire with him quoting, \u201cI am the flail of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.\u201c"

Why is she so popular, I must be missing something. I heard her songs on the radio, but to me this didn\u2019t equate to the success, popularity, and overall critical acclaim that she was receiving. I set out to figure out what the hype was and if I could figure it out. I am by no means her age, old enough to be her mother, but I feel after my pandemic journey down this rabbit hole that I have some insight into why she is so popularHer best songs are not on the radio. As I mentioned, I had heard her hit songs, they were catchy, but to me they all were not iconic stand out songs and I could not see how these songs were equalling her popularity and critical acclaim. What I found out is that her best songs are usually not on the radio. Fans and critics know this, but I didn\u2019t because I had never listened to an album of hers before. I don\u2019t understand it, but obviously it has worked for her, but her best songs are not the songs that everyone knows from the radio. If anyone is basing their judgment on radio hits, then they are way off base, as I was.She is the best songwriter today. This is a bold statement. I didn\u2019t think this because of point #1 above. But, as I went down the rabbit hole to figure this out, I realized what talent she has. I had always heard this, and the critics seemed to all be in agreement on this point, but I had just not heard much consistency with lyricism to think of her that highly. But, now I get it. She is amazing. She is highly intelligent, interweaves literary references from Bronte, Hemingway, FScott Fitzgerald, Wordsworth, Du Maurier, Browning, etc. If you don\u2019t know, then you don\u2019t know. Sometimes they are just catchy lines, but if you don\u2019t know, you will miss a literary reference. She speaks in metaphors, everything is a metaphor for something else. If you think it is a shallow song, I bet there is a much deeper meaning to it. Take her song Welcome To New York. Of course this has a dual meaning, right? She\u2019s using it as a metaphor. She is a story teller with excellent diction and if someone listens to her storytelling songs they can picture the scene, smell the smells, feel the breeze and imagine what its like being in that room experiencing what she is referring to. And, she always leaves some of the details out until the end, like a punchline or a conclusion, or a twist at the end. If you haven\u2019t listened, then you don\u2019t know. Neither did I.She plays several instruments and writes her own material. She is a musician that usually writes on piano or guitar. Any one of her songs, even the heavy pop hits, she can break that down and play it acoustically at a concert. She doesn\u2019t have a team of writers. She writes. The credits the producers but she is the songwriter. She writes differently depending upon the song. During pandemic, she toplined background tracks written by Aaron Dessner from the National. The first of those was Cardigan. He sent her some background music and went for a run. When he got back she had written the melody and lyrics. She is a prolific writer. People and critics didn\u2019t believe it, so for her third album she wrote exclusively by herself to prove everyone wrong. The critics never said another word.She expands the musical experience beyond simply listening to music. She puts out easter eggs and clues, puzzles, and keeps the fan base engaged in trying to figure out these clues. It is fun, can be frustrating, but I can see how this has been a huge way to keep her fans engaged and adds another level to the musical experience.She is down to earth. Each album since RED (RED, 1989, Reputation, Lover) prior to pandemic, she has invited about 100 fans to 3\u20134 of her homes in LA, London, Rhode Island, Nashville, etc\u2026 to entertain them, bakes cookies for them, has gifts for them, knows their names, and plays the album for them before the album is released. This is a way of connecting with her fans one-on-one and genuinely seems to enjoy this. I did not know she did anything like this but this seems to be a big deal, and prior to pandemic, something she really enjoyed sharing with her fans.She is an advocate for other artists. She stood up to Apple Music with the famous Apple Letter, took all her music down, and demanded that artists be paid fairly for streaming. The next day Apple changed their policy. She notoriously refused to put her music on Spotify due to lack of paying artists. This battle made such an impact on the future of streaming rights and $, that it will be included in the Netflix documentary on Spotify. And recently, with her re-recording her masters has brought the attention to artists and how the record labels own the work, not the artists. This has already made an impact on new artists as they now have leverage to at least negotiate the ownership of their masters. For instance, new artist Olivia Rodrigo credits Taylor Swift for paving the way and giving her the courage to fight to control her masters, and she owns them because of it.Her songs are not about breakups. A common misconception that I fell into before I started my research, not all her songs are about breakups and boyfriends. Keeping in mind that artists of all types (painters, writers, poets, sculptors, singers, etc) usually create art from what inspires them or what they know or have experienced or what they are feeling. Taylor certainly is known for this. BUT, every artist does it. I have no problem with this, and neither should anyone. If so, then they have a problem also with Shakespeare, da Vinci, etc. EVERY artist pulls from their own self and writes. What I found is that she writes about all kinds of things, some of them are relationships. Sometimes she will write about a relationship and 10 years later she will write about it again, but from a different perspective, or a different side of an event. Because there are always different sides, emotional, feeling, the direct event, the aftermath, all types of ways to write about a certain event. Then, as one looks back 10 years later, I\u2019m sure those emotions or ways of expressing the event is very different. I like that she can and does do this. 5 songs may be about a given event but each will tell a different story. I don\u2019t know any other artist who can do this.She does indeed write about her life. Although she is getting away from this as she has gotten older, she has and still does on some songs write about her life. I like this. It give her fans a little bit of a view into her world and her life. Which is what the fans want, to be closer to her. She doesn\u2019t do it because of that, she does it because it is what she knows. For instance, the album Reputation has 15 tracks and it tells a story about meeting someone, leaving a relationship, feeling a connection with that new someone, beginning to date and the insecurities of a new relationship, and beginning to fall in love. Listening to the album shares a view into her life during that time. At the end of the album, she has fallen in love and you know exactly what it was like for her to fall in love. The following album, Lover, picks up where Reputation left off in that it is an album about BEING in love. These two albums are love albums and they are all about her life.Each album is different. I guess I knew she started in country music, but I had never listened to it. But, each album, and she has 9 now, is a different sound. She has ventured into 4 different genres of music and nailed each one. Country, country pop, pop, pop with RnB and rap, bubblegum pop, indie/folk,, and she even did a little jazz on Lover album. She can do any genre of music because she is a lover of music, she likes all music. I don\u2019t know any other artist who is as versatile. I cannot believe how versatile she is. And, she is able to seemingly jump back and forth between these genres within months, weeks, or even within albums themselves. She is a chameleon. Every album you don\u2019t know what you are going to get. Many artists today are very predictable. The same sound, or maybe the same style. Nothing new. Not pushing boundaries. Not taking risks. Not jumping into other genres. Taylor has been doing that her entire career. This keeps the fans guessing what kind of album is she going to put out next. It will always be a different sound from the previous album. Once she puts the album out, she mentally checks out and she\u2019s already moved on to the next project. She doesn\u2019t stay there too long.All of these things and I\u2019m sure there are plenty more, make her stand out. I had never listened to an album of hers before pandemic, and that became my pandemic project to figure out her popularity. I think I found several things about her that I did not know. I judged her music based on Shake it Off (I despise that song) or other songs that I felt just weren\u2019t as good as her popularity and acclaim. Now I know. I get it now. And, I think she is the best songwriter today, and making the best music today. That\u2019s my conclusions to why she is so popular and how she is different.",

This relation principle, power-distance index, is mentioned in Outliers :  \"Power distance is concerned with attitudes toward hierarchy, specifically with how much a particular culture values and respects authority.\"In this example, Taylor Swift is a low-PDI country.  \"In low-PDI Austria, Prime Minister Bruno Kreisky was known to sometimes take the streetcar to work.\" Taylor does more than take the streetcar to work: she invites 89 crazed fans into her house for what appears to be a screaming match and pizza. By doing this, fans feel they can reach out to Taylor for advice. You won't find any half-hearted Taylor Swift fans. Everyone is OBSESSED. They are not only obsessed with her, but her ability to put their exact thoughts into words.  We see PDI factor into politics all the time. Since Jackson's presidency, people want to vote for the \"common man.\" Someone who has been where they have been and figured out how to make it out on top. Taylor has made it to the top, or at least, past adolescence, and her fans listen to her to encourage them that there is a way out of any problem they are facing.    She knows her audience. Taylor doesn't sing about getting drunk. She doesn't sing about size. She doesn't sing about going to clubs (although this one is because she doesn't go to clubs herself). She sings about feeling left out. She sings about regret. She sings about revenge. She sings about the stages of loving and losing someone. The former songs are fun to listen to, but I am not wholeheartedly singing about how I need to \"Stay High\" to get a boy off my mind. Shaking off the haters? That's a message everyone can get behind.   I love Taylor. She is able to intelligently explain feelings without leaving me feeling like I just read a psychology graduate's paper. And if I'm lucky, she might like my Instagram post. ( See what I mean by low-PDI?)",

She has really come a long way with 1989 and I couldn't be more proud of her. Here are some reasons why Taylor is my favorite human being in the world. 1. Her songwriting is bomb Taylor is an incredible songwriter. This girl wrote her entire album \"Speak Now\" at age 21. The emotion and realness of her songs leaves me wonder-struck every time. 2. Her lyrics are relatable There's a Taylor Swift song for every situation you go through in life. That's a straight up fact. 3. She's ruthless (in the best way) \"Teardrops On My Guitar\" is the best example \u2014 Drew is directly called out. That boy had to learn the hard way not to mess with Taylor's feelings. 4. She plays four instruments Taylor plays the guitar, piano, ukulele and banjo. How can someone be so good at everything? 5. Her music videos All of her music videos tell a story.

Whether it's at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, or simply walking down the street in New York City, she is slaying. 10. Her cats I'm not even a cat person, and I'm still obsessed with Meredith and Olivia. That's saying a lot. 11. She embraces her awkwardness Taylor has made awkward become cool. People may make fun of her dance moves, but that only motivates her to shake if off even more. 12. She's so down-to-earth Taylor is one of the most famous stars out there, and yet she acts so humble. She continues to get super-excited each time she wins an award, and I love it. 13. Her family Taylor and her mom are BFFs and it's the cutest thing ever. She even dedicated the song \"Best Day\" to her. She's very close with her dad as well, and her younger brother, Austin. 14.

Her humor is the best. 18. She's caring Taylor is constantly giving back and putting her money and time to great causes.

She has fans that range from five years old to 95 years old, because how can you not love her? 20. She's an inspiration Taylor has taught us to accept ourselves and be comfortable with who we are.
