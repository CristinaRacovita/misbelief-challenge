Steve Crocker led the development of the host protocols for ARPANET and formed the Network Working Group made up of many from the institutions funded by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to do research in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Bob Kahn was a key ARPANET architect at BBN but joined ARPA in late 1972. He initiated the INTERNETTING research program and I received funding at Stanford University to work on the design of a system of heterogeneous networks. Bob and I wrote the first description of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in September 1973 and reviewed it with the International Network Working Group that I chaired and which was set up at the time of the first public demonstration of the ARPANET in October 1972 (Bob Kahn organized this with Larry Roberts' encouragement). In May, 1974, the more formal paper on TCP was published in the IEEE Transactions on Communications.  There were many people who were involved in refining the TCP and splitting it into TCP/IP. The Internet Society has recognized many of them in its Internet Hall of Fame as pioneers. Jon Postel, Dave Clark, Bob Braden, Danny Cohen, David Reed, Noel Chiappa, and many others. There is a plaque at Stanford that references many who worked specifically on TCP in the first three years or so of the project from 1973 to 1976.  Also, I can confirm that Bob Kahn and I wrote a response to the unfair criticism of Al Gore which Kron has correctly identified.  You can find a copy of that response at http://amsterdam.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0009/msg00311.html.",

            "The router's invention is a collective effort over time and not attributed to a single inventor. Key contributors to its development include Paul Baran, Leonard Kleinrock, Donald Davies, Larry Roberts, Vint Cerf, and Bob Kahn, among others. They played crucial roles in the development of packet switching and early networking technologies that laid the foundation for routing in computer networks.",
            "If you're talking about routers as in the woodworking tool, I've seen an example from the late 1930s. It worked just like modern routers, without the plunge feature, but harder to adjust depth of cut. Don't remember the manufacturer, though.",

Licklider became the first Director of IPTO and gave his vision of a galactic network. Also, with ideas from Licklider and Kleinrock, Robert Taylor helped create the idea of the network that later became ARPANET. INITIAL CREATION The Internet as we know it today first started being developed in the late 1960's.In the summer of 1968, the Network Working Group (NWG) held its first meeting, chaired by Elmer Shapiro, at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). Other attendees included Steve Carr, Steve Crocker, Jeff Rulifson, and Ron Stoughton. In the meeting, the group discussed solving issues related to getting hosts to communicate with each other.In December 1968, Elmer Shapiro with SRI released a report \"A Study of Computer Network Design Parameters.\" Based on this work and earlier work done by Paul Baran, Thomas Marill and others, Lawrence Roberts and Barry Wessler created the Interface Message Processor (IMP) specifications. Bolt Beranek and Newman, Inc. (BBN) was later awarded the contract to design and build the IMP subnetwork. GENERAL PUBLIC LEARNS ABOUT INTERNET The UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) put out a press release introducing the public to the Internet on July 3, 1969.First network equipment Leonard Kleinrock standing next to IMPOn August 29, 1969, the first network switch and the first piece of network equipment called \"IMP\" (Interface Message Processor) is sent to UCLA.On September 2, 1969, the first data moves from the UCLA host to the switch. The picture to the right is Leonard Kleinrock next to the IMP. THE FIRST MESSAGE AND NETWORK CRASH On Friday October 29, 1969 at 10:30 p.m., the first Internet message was sent from computer science Professor Leonard KleinRock's laboratory at UCLA, after the second piece of network equipment was installed at SRI. The connection not only enabled the first transmission to be made, but is also considered the first Internet backbone.The first message to be distributed was \"LO\", which was an attempt at \"LOGIN\" by Charley S. Kline to log into the SRI computer from UCLA. However, the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system crashed. Shortly after the crash, the issue was resolved, and he was able to log into the computer. EMAIL IS DEVELOPED Ray Tomlinson sends the first network e-mail in 1971. It's the first messaging system to send messages across a network to other users. TCP IS DEVELOPED Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn design TCP during 1973 and later publish it with the help of Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December of 1974 in RFC 675. Most people consider these two people the inventors of the Internet. FIRST COMMERCIAL NETWORK A commercial version of ARPANET, known as Telenet, is introduced in 1974 and considered to be the first Internet Service Provider (ISP). ETHERNET IS CONCEIVED Bob Metcalfe develops the idea of Ethernet in 1973.The Modem is introduced Dennis Hayes and Dale Heatherington released the 80-103A Modem in 1977. The Modem and their subsequent modems become a popular choice for home users to connect to the Internet and get online.TCP/IP is created In 1978, TCP splits into TCP/IP, driven by Danny Cohen, David Reed, and John Shoch to support real-time traffic. The creation of TCP/IP help create UDP and is later standardized into ARPANET on January 1, 1983. Today TCP/IP is still the primary protocol used on the Internet. DNS IS INTRODUCED Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postel introduce DNS in 1984, which also introduces the domain name system. The first Internet domain name, symbolics.com, is registered on March 15, 1985 by Symbolics, a Massachusetts computer company. FIRST COMMERCIAL DIAL-UP ISP The first commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the US, known as \"The World\", is introduced in 1989. The World was the first ISP to be used on what we now consider to be the Internet. HTML Tim Berners-LeeIn 1990, Tim Berners-Lee develops HTML, which made a huge contribution to how we navigate and view the Internet today. WWW Tim Berners-Lee introduces WWW to the public on August 6, 1991. The World Wide Web (WWW) is what most people today consider the \"Internet\" or a series of sites and pages that are connected with links. The Internet had hundreds of people who helped develop the standards and technologies used today, but without the WWW, the Internet would not be as popular as it is today. FIRST GRAPHICAL INTERNET BROWSER NCSA Mosaic 1.0Mosaic is the first widely used graphical World Wide Web browser developed and first released on April 22, 1993 by the NCSA with the help of Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina. A big competitor to Mosaic was Netscape, which was released a year later. Today, most of the Internet browsers we use today, e.g. Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, etc., got their inspiration from the Mosaic browser. JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT Originally known as oak, Java is a programming language developed by James Gosling and others at Sun Microsystems. It was first introduced to the public in 1995 and today is widely used to create Internet applications and other software programs.JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 and originally known as LiveScript. It was first introduced to the public with Netscape Navigator 2.0 and was renamed to JavaScript with the release of Netscape Navigator 2.0B3. JavaScript is an interpreted client-side scripting language that allows a web designer the ability to insert code into their web page.",

We all know that Tesla is planning many Gigafactories where they will manufacture these batteries in bulk so as to lower the costs of production. This is one thing we can expect Tesla to do over the years. This news article of Quartz says as much - Tesla could finally set up shop in India\u2014but not with its cars  Anyway, Tesla is cool and I for one surely want Elon Musk to set up space in India. Maybe Narendra Modi will need some more convincing power!Further, India needs to have regulatory support for electric cars. Presently electric cars have subsidies upto Rs. 150,000. In addition to this, some states have partial exemption on VAT. However, more needs to be done to give big manufacturers like Tesla an incentive to produce in India.  SELLING CARS IN INDIA Another possibility for Tesla is to sell their cars in India. But import duty in India is very high. If you are an Indian who wants to import a car from outside, you need to pay import duty of 125%. That's huge! This is mainly to ensure support to domestic car manufacturers, but in that case, Tesla is going to be very expensive in India.  Details of customs duties on vehicles can be found here. Notice that the same rate of import duty is applicable for electric cars as well. This specific concern was raised by Elon Musk also, as evidenced by this tweet - So, like Musk pointed out, we should hope for some relaxation in import duties for electric cars, otherwise the whole point of Tesla cars will be invalid in India.  Let's hope for the best!",

Tesla has stores / galleries in Sydney, Hong Kong, Osaka and Tokyo.

Stores & Service Centers  It is logical that Tesla would enter larger markets such as China (mainland), South Korea before coming to India. Audi sold 9003 cars in India in 2012 and 405838 cars in China the same year. So although the Indian car market is growing fast, the size of the Chinese market is 20-40 times India's based on the segment. Also the recent depreciation (August 2013) of the Rupee by over 20% would make the Tesla-S cost over a Rs10 million (1 crore) along with the 100% duty on cars costing over US$40,000-. The Tesla S base model costs US$70000 (without the US tax credit). Based on the above, I would say after 5 years or longer. If you do not want to wait, you can buy it in Hong Kong when it becomes available and have it shipped. Car imports are allowed and cars over a certain value are exempted from homologation / testing. But you would have to service it yourself locally.",

India's auto market is not as big as ChinaTesla usually sets up the ecosystem - Super charger stations to charge Teslas in the routes. India being a big country, they would need to go ahead with a plan on which areas to cover with first set of super charger stations. However, Tesla's battery packs have piqued Modi's interest. There is a possibility of Tesla setting up a Gigafactory soon though it would take time.Mahindra's Reva is not doing sizeable numbers at this moment. That gives out the trend on EVs in India. However Tesla comes across as a cross between EV and affordable super car. That might entice the buyers in S-series, Jaguar range.--  Soure: Tesla could finally set up shop in India\u2014but not with its cars ",

He was a significant investor to the company a short while after creation. He used his money from the sale of PayPal (which, also contrary to common knowledge, he did not build from the ground up) to take Tesla from an engineering project to a production car company. After he became an investor, a nasty battle between him and Eberhard (that started when each person blamed the other for drastically missing the budget) caused a lot of press and a lawsuit, resulting in Eberhard being kicked out of the company, and Elon being allowed to represent himself as a founder, since his money and involvement were critical to the company. After gaining solid control of Tesla, Elon began to optimize the engineering processes to turn Tesla into what you see it today. The first Tesla, the Roadster, was more developed than engineered, and wisely so since the cost of designing, manufacturing, and fabricating a novel EV would have left the young company broke. The Roadster used a Lotus-built glider and a battery made by AC Propulsion, among other outsourced parts. Using off the shelf parts to build a production car was not an optimal long-run solution for Tesla as it yields lower profit margins, but it was well worth it as it got the car to market quickly, promoted the brand, and gave people a new idea of what an electric car could be. (More on the development of the Roadster). After the electric car was no longer viewed as a toy, the Tesla team knew that they could make a more practical car: the Model S. And here we are today.",

For years, Trump continued to foster the \u201cbirther\u201d lie that President Obama was a Muslim and not born in the United States, leading many voters to doubt Obama\u2019s documented place of birth and thus the legitimacy of his presidency. In September 2016 Trump finally did admit that Obama was born in the United States, but he also falsely alleged that Hillary Clinton had started the birther lie. 2. Trump claimed that he saw Muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11, which encouraged in some of his followers an unfounded hostility toward Muslims. 3. He said he would have won the popular vote in 2016 if millions of illegal aliens had not voted for Hillary Clinton, which undermines confidence in the legitimacy of the U.S. electoral system. 4. He claimed that the U.S. unemployment rate was 42 percent, when it was actually around five percent. 5. He claimed that the United States has the highest taxes in the world, leading many Americans to believe that the U.S. tax system is unfair. 6. He claimed that President Obama had tapped the phones of Trump\u2019s transition operation. 7. In 2017, he asserted that the U.S. murder rate was the highest in 47 years when the national murder rate had been steadily falling since the 1990s. I do suspect it is habitual thing and not necessarily a conscious thing with him. I do however think it is part and parcel to who he is, but I also think it is part of his plan to sway voters\u2026 and it works. The biggest problem with his lies (outside it being wrong), is that once a person buys into a lie, it is nearly impossible to change that person\u2019s mind\u2026 even when faced with facts.",

People who read what he writes on a regular basis can find many examples such as this without having to rely on the media. If you read what he writes for long enough, you will quickly come to the conclusion that he lies on a regular basis. What's worse, he doesn't just lie about the big things then try to cover it up, he lies about the most banal of things and doesn't do anything to try to hide it. You ask why \"some\" people call him a liar. What research have you done to find out whether he is? Do you read his twitter feed regularly? Do you compare statements he has made over a few days to see if he contradicts himself? I gave an example above that is easy enough to verify. Why not look for more?
