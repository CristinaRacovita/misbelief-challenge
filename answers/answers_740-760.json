            "You CANNOT liquify light gases as O2, N2 (the main components of air) or other such as CH4 by compression at room temperature. Their critical temperatures are very low (cryogenic, e.g.: lower than -100 \u00baC for oxygen, close to -150 \u00baC for nitrogen), which means that they are at a \u201csupercritical\u201d state at ambient temperature. In turn, that means essentially there is no liquid; no matter how high you compress them, liquid doesn\u2019t appear and you get only a denser gas.

(This is used for instance for using natural gas in vehicles; it is compressed greatly, up to 300 bar, to get more density and then less volume.) For comparison, other gases can be liquified by compression. For instance, steam, water vapor or vapor of H2O has a critical temperature of almost 380 \u00baC. This means of course that it is liquid at ambient conditions. To be a vapor, pressure must be either a vacuum or the partial pressure within a very diluted mixture (e.g., air saturated with steam has less than 2 % weight of it). Another example is liquified petroleum gases (LPG), propane and butane. Their critical temperatures are in the range of 100 \u00baC. At ambient temperature, you can get them liquid by applying moderate pressures, in the order of 10s of bar. That\u2019s why they call them \u201cliquified\u201d.",
            "It takes approximately 1000 times atmospheric pressure (1,000 bar or 14,500 psi) to compress air into liquid at room temperature.\"Curious about the amount of pressure required to turn air into liquid at room temperature? Click the link in our bio for all the fascinating details!\"",
            "It is usually thought that no gas can be turned into a \u201ctraditional\u201d liquid (or solid), whichever the pressure you apply, unless it is at a temperature below its critical one. Now, the critical temperature for (di)nitrogen and (di)oxygen, the two gases that account for about 99% of air, is -147 \u00b0C and -119 \u00b0C, respectively, well below room temperature. So, air cannot be liquified at room temperature just by submitting it to very large pressure. Yet, these thought have to be updated. As regards nitrogen, as pointed out by mr. Morgan Chandler (see its comment to this answer of mine) recent experiContinue ReadingIt is usually thought that no gas can be turned into a \u201ctraditional\u201d liquid (or solid), whichever the pressure you apply, unless it is at a temperature below its critical one.

So, air cannot be liquified at room temperature just by submitting it to very large pressure. Yet, these thought have to be updated. As regards nitrogen, as pointed out by mr. Morgan Chandler (see its comment to this answer of mine) recent experiments were able to turn its gaseous phase into a \u201cmetallic, electrically-conductive, fluid polymer\u201d; the phase change took place at about 3000 K and 1.2 millions of atmospheres. Evidently, with reference to the phase diagram of nitrogen, while the phase boundary between liquid and gaseous phases vanishes at the critical point, the phase boundary between one of the \u201csolid\u201d phases and the gaseous one still exists at 3000 K, and can be crossed by a suitably high increase of pressure. As regards oxygen, in 1979, it was discovered that, at pressures above 10 GPa (about 10,000 atm), it becomes a red solid. In 1990, it was seen that, at 96 GPa (about 100,000 atm), it forms a metallic phase.",
            "To answer this you need to start by finding a phase diagram for nitrogen (which is the main component) . You will generally find research into the megaPascal range, but that may not be enough. If the boundary between liquid and solid phases slopes to the left as pressure rises, and I suspect it does, then there is a good chance you would no get a solid phase at room temperature at any pressure."

However, when it comes to their vision, there is a common misconception that dogs can only see in black and white. In reality, dogs are not completely color blind, but they do see the world differently than humans do. In this article, we will explore the science behind dog vision and answer the question of whether or not dogs can see color. Firstly, it is important to understand that the human eye has three types of color-detecting cells, or cones, which allow us to see a range of colors. Dogs, on the other hand, have only two types of cones, which means they are not able to see the full spectrum of colors that humans can. Specifically, dogs have cones that are sensitive to blue and yellow-green light, but they do not have cones that are sensitive to red or green light. This means that dogs see the world in shades of blue and yellow, with some variation in shades of gray. Colors such as red and green appear as shades of gray to dogs. However, dogs are still able to see some colors, and they can distinguish between different shades of blue and yellow. In fact, some studies have shown that dogs may be able to see some shades of green and red, but they are not able to distinguish between these colors as well as humans can. This is because the red and green cones in the human eye are very close together, while in dogs, the cones are farther apart. This means that dogs do not see the same range of colors as humans, but they are not completely color blind. So, why do dogs see the world differently than humans? One theory is that dogs evolved to see the world in shades of blue and yellow because these are the colors that are most important for their survival. Dogs are predators, and they need to be able to see their prey in low light conditions. Blue and yellow are the colors that are most visible in low light, which makes it easier for dogs to spot their prey. Another theory is that dogs evolved to see the world in shades of blue and yellow because these are the colors that are most important for their social interactions with other dogs. Dog fur is typically shades of brown and gray, which can be difficult to distinguish in low light. However, the skin underneath a dog's fur is often a shade of yellow, which is more visible to dogs. This means that dogs may be able to use their ability to see shades of yellow to read the facial expressions of other dogs and communicate with them. while dogs are not able to see the full spectrum of colors that humans can, they are not completely color blind. Dogs see the world in shades of blue and yellow, with some variation in shades of gray. This unique vision is thought to have evolved to help dogs survive and interact with other dogs. Understanding how dogs see the world can help us better understand their behavior and communicate with them in a way that they can understand.

            "Many adults think that dogs and cats cannot see any colors, only shades of gray. But this is not true. Cats and dogs can see some colors but not all of them. So in a sense they are like adults who are colorblind. Cats and dogs have cells in their eyes that respond well in bright and dim light. At night, cats and dogs use cells called rods that are sensitive to dim light. They are found in a lining at the back of the eye called the retina. When light falls on the rods, they send a message to the brain to explain the image that they see. For the bright light of day, you need cells called cones.

When light falls on the rods, they send a message to the brain to explain the image that they see. For the bright light of day, you need cells called cones. But having cones in your eyes also means that you can also see color. Humans have three kinds of cones that allow them to see blue, red and green. So humans (and monkeys!) can see in full color. Dogs and cats only have two kinds of cones sensitive to blue and green light. So they do see some colors. By the way, if you have a horse or pony at home, they have red and blue cones. Horses see some colors, but they can't tell green from gray. Now, do cats' eyes glow in the dark? No they don't. Cats and dogs have some cells behind the retina that act like a mirror. These cells are found in a part of the eye called the tapetum. This mirror reflects light back, giving the rods and cones a second chance to pick up the small amount of light available at night. It is this tapetum that makes cats' and dogs' eyes seem to glow in the dark. Humans don't have a tapetum. You may have noticed that if you use flash to take a photo, humans tend to look like they have red eyes. This is because there is a reflection of the red blood vessels behind our retinas. If you took a flash picture of your dog, you might see yellow or orange eyes instead. This is a reflection of the light of the flash by the dog's tapetum.",
            "A dog can see yellow, blue, and gray.  They have two types of cones:  Yellow and blue. They lack the retinal cones for red/green, so essentially they see color like a red/green colorblind person. Dogs have a higher percentage of rods than cones, compared to humans.  Cones are for color, while rods are used for detecting motion and providing greater acuity in low-light situations. So, dogs can see motion better than we can.

So, dogs are good at detecting movement and seeing in low light levels Dogs see the color red as dark gray/brown/black.  Yellow, orange, green all look like different shades of yellow.  Purple looks like blue. Additional differences:  Dog's eyes tend to be more widely spread on the head, so they tend to have better peripheral vision than humans.  However, this also causes them to lack visual acuity and depth perception, compared to us. Contrary to popular belief, dogs aren't colorblind ... but their ability to see color is limited.  They've evolved to concentrate their vision on where it matters to them:  Movement, and low-light situations. After thinking about this:  I'm getting yellow and blue dog toys now.",

The coneshaped retinal cells are responsible for colour and the sharpness of vision, the rods for dark and clear perception. Dogs have a third kind of cells which makes them see 6x better in the dark (night vision) than humans who lack this intertwined cells or layer. It is quite obvious that when a species\u2019eye is stuffed with more or different hardware, this is at the cost of something else. Since dogs have less coneshaped cells which are responsible for the sharpness of the image, they see less sharp as us humans. The objects need to be nearer and they are way better with the detection and fixation of moving objects. Colours are nothing else but wavelengths of light that is reflected by an object. When light bounces off or is absorbed this will influence its wavelength. There are colour ranges humans cannot see, what humans can see is comprimed between 390 nm and 790 nm (some say a bit less or more). Remember the cover of the Pink Floyd Album \u201cdark side of the moon\u201d? That is what we see\u2026 A dog\u2019s colour spectrum is shifted to the left compared to us humans, so he would see the Pink Floyd cover more \u2018blueish\u2019 and he would see the UV spectrum as well. Now this is where it really gets interesting! Experiments conducted in 2014 where human retina\u2019s were bombared with a double energy of photons, revealed that humans continued to see objects or animals for at least 30 minutes in\u2026 infrared. The finding was coincidal because some lab technicians involved in IR experiments reported they continued seeing things in IR afterwards\u2026 Meaning that the human eye is less evolved (more reptilian) than the wolves\u2019eye, who can \u2018see\u2019 scent and smells in the UV spectrum. Hard to imagine for us humans but dogs can conclude out of how they see scents in UV whether the trail is fresh or old, how old, age, gender, whatsoever\u2026 Summarized: dogs see less colours than we humans, and probably less sharp too, due to less coneshaped cells in the retina. They do however see in the dark nearly as well as felines and where we are completely or almost blind. And their colour spectrum shifts towards and beyond the 390 nm (blue and UV) while ours reaches 790 nm or beyond (red spectrum and IR when bombarded with photons)\u2026",

            "Your joints, including those in your knuckles, are surrounded by a membrane called the synovial membrane, which forms a capsule around the ends of your bones.

When you \u201ccrack\u201d your knuckles, or any other joint, it expands the space between your bones, creating negative pressure that draws synovial fluid into the new gap.

            "Joints produce that CRACK when bubbles burst in the fluid surrounding the joint. Joints are the meeting points of two separate bones, held together and in place by connective tissues and ligaments. All of the joints in our bodies are surrounded by synovial fluid, a thick, clear liquid. When you stretch or bend your finger to pop the knuckle, you're causing the bones of the joint to pull apart.

Joints are the meeting points of two separate bones, held together and in place by connective tissues and ligaments. All of the joints in our bodies are surrounded by synovial fluid, a thick, clear liquid. When you stretch or bend your finger to pop the knuckle, you're causing the bones of the joint to pull apart. As they do, the connective tissue capsule that surrounds the joint is stretched. By stretching this capsule, you increase its volume. And as we know from chemistry class, with an increase in volume comes a decrease in pressure. So as the pressure of the synovial fluid drops, gases dissolved in the fluid become less soluble, forming bubbles through a process called cavitation. When the joint is stretched far enough, the pressure in the capsule drops so low that these bubbles burst, producing the pop that we associate with knuckle cracking.It takes about 25 to 30 minutes for the gas to redissolve into the joint fluid. During this period of time, your knuckles won't crack. Once the gas is redissolved, cavitation is once again possible, and you can start popping your knuckles again.

            "The actual answer to this question, is no one really knows!  But a lot of people think they know (and some of these people agree).  The most commonly agreed upon reason is: Cavitation (small cavities of vacuum form in the fluid between your joints and rapidly collapse causing that 'popping' or 'cracking' sound). Because of the synovial fluid found at joints, cavitation can explain how you 'crack' just about any joint in your body.  When you manipulate a joint (bending your fingers towards the palm, twisting your spine, etc) the force separates the articular surfaces of a synovial joint - this Continue ReadingThe actual answer to this question, is no one really knows!

Because of the synovial fluid found at joints, cavitation can explain how you 'crack' just about any joint in your body.  When you manipulate a joint (bending your fingers towards the palm, twisting your spine, etc) the force separates the articular surfaces of a synovial joint - this reduces the pressure in the joint cavity.   Now what happens next is still not agreed, but most people think that in your now low-pressure joint cavity some of the gases that are in the synovial fluid form a bubble or cavity, escape, and the rapid collapse after their escape causes the 'pop' or 'click'.  The relief from this sensation will vary, depending on how quickly the gases (suspected to be mostly carbon dioxide, perhaps a little nitrogen) reabsorb into the synovial fluid in the joint capsule. The other common suggestion is rapid ligament stretching (it may actually be a little of both, since those people that tend to pop and crack a lot also have to increased ligament flexibility in these joints).",
            "People around you breathe a sigh of relief. Yes, I\u2019m making a joke, because my son used to drive his classmates crazy cracking his knuckles. When he ran out of knuckles, if he was wearing sandals, he\u2019d start on his toes. Yikes. Nothing bad will happen to your hands if you stop cracking your knuckles.

Martin Co., the Apollo Command Module was built by North American Aviation, the Apollo Lunar Module was built by Grumman, the lead contractors for the Saturn V were Boeing, North American Aviation, Douglas Aircraft Co. and IBM. The rockets that flew to the moon from the United States were all built by private enterprise, not some government agency. What Armstrong said, in part, to Congress was: \"I am very concerned that the new plan, as I understand it, will prohibit us from having human access to low Earth orbit on our own rockets and spacecraft until the private aerospace industry is able to qualify their hardware under development as rated for human occupancy. I support the encouragement of the newcomers toward their goal of lower-cost access to space. But having cut my teeth in rockets more than 50 years ago, I am not confident. The most experienced rocket engineers with whom I have spoken believe that it will require many years and substantial investment to reach the necessary level of safety and reliability.\" While I am certainly not privy to Armstrong\u2019s private thoughts on the matter, let\u2019s just consider what this particular statement says and try to put his words in context. \"I am very concerned that the new plan, as I understand it, will prohibit us from having human access to low Earth orbit on our own rockets and spacecraft until the private aerospace industry is able to qualify their hardware under development as rated for human occupancy. \u201c When Armstrong made this remark, the final space shuttle mission (STS-135) had flown more than a year before (July 8, 2011 to July 21, 2011.) The follow-on manned-spaceflight project (Constellation) had already been cancelled by the Obama administration, and the United States was already dependant upon the good graces of Russia in order to have access to the International Space Station. At this point, not only did the U.S. lack a functional capacity for manned spaceflight, it lacked a funded plan for regaining that capability. Armstrong\u2019s concern about private aerospace developing hardware \u201crated for human occupancy\u201d was prescient \u2014 there are STILL no private spacecraft rated for human occupancy, despite the success of SpacEx and Blue Origin. Musk may well fly a manned mission before the end of 2018, but it will still be considered \u201cexperimental\u201d rather than \u201coperational.\u201d The clock is ticking and it has been nearly seven years since a manned U.S. spacecraft has flown. This is the longest hiatus in U.S. spaceflight since the beginning of Project Mercury (1958.) Human-Rating a spacecraft is no mean feat \u2014 the learning curve is rather steep and the price is measured in human lives. We\u2019ve lost 18 astronauts and cosmonauts during space missions, not counting the death of Major Michael Adams during an X-15 flight. Three American astronauts burned to death on the ground in the Apollo I fire. Another 10 astronauts and cosmonauts died during training exercises and simulations. Rockets explode. Systems fail. Shit happens. The environment of space is inherently lethal to air-breathing mammals with a limited tolerance for extremes of temperature, pressure, and radiation. \u201cThe most experienced rocket engineers with whom I have spoken believe that it will require many years and substantial investment to reach the necessary level of safety and reliability.\" In the six years since Armstrong made these remarks, SpacEx has compiled a remarkably good record of 47 successful flights out of 49 launches, with a single in-flight failure resulting in loss-of-vehicle, one in-flight failure where the payload failed to reach its intended orbit, and one explosive failure on the ground during tests. Most would agree that Falcon and Dragon are ready to begin the process of human-rating the spacecraft. When this occurs, we will still not be on par with the capabilities of the space shuttle we had in 2011 \u2014 Seven astronauts and up to 50,000 lbs cargo to low Earth orbit. Finally, and this is strictly my own opinion, it seems that the astronaut corps is frustrated by a lack of both direction and funding in United States space efforts. What exactly do we want from NASA and the manned spaceflight program? Once we get around to answering that question, we need to find some way to adequately fund that mission and maintain some reasonable level of manned spaceflight capability in the interim.",

And the word gave rise to a religion. And this religion gave rise to a tradition of asceticism. Men of extreme abnegation and devotion to their sacred scriptures renounced the pleasures and blessings of the world and ventured far away to live in solitude, sometimes into the mountains, sometimes into the desert, and even sometimes atop pillars. They were called athletes of God. But a curious thing happened to these men who wanted nothing more than to be left alone to their spiritual pursuits: they acquired not just admirers and emulators but also followers, younger men eager to embark on a similar spiritual journey. In vain, our ascetic athletes tried to shake them off. But the followers were there to stay. Over time, this process became more organized, giving rise to a paradoxical community of would-be loners. The word monastery, with its root monos, still pays silent homage to the original longing for solitude of the unwitting founders of the regular clergy. The high mark of this way of life was the Middle Ages. Monasteries, full of men who, when they weren\u2019t busy praying, spent their days working and learning, became repositories of both scholarship and agricultural productivity. An important part of this agricultural output was the making of wine. Where else was one to find enough blood of Christ for all the sacraments that needed to be performed? Of course, having acquired expertise in wine-making, it wasn\u2019t making too far a leap for monasteries to also start producing other alcoholic beverages. Bruno of Cologne was a philosopher, theologian, and former teacher and mentor to Pope Urban II. He was also the founder of the Carthusian order. It was in a valley of the Chartreuse Mountains that the first modest building of this order was located. Centuries later, it had become a complex of gargantuan proportions, and it is there that a famous liqueur was produced and commercialized in the 18th century from a recipe whose first version goes back to 1605.La Grande Chartreuse. Just as the monastery had been named after the mountain range, the liqueur was named after the monastery.And this characteristic color was named after the liqueur. If you ask me, it\u2019s an underrated color. Here is what you need to do.Get a chartreuse sweater.Add a blue coat. This will serve to contrast with and thereby highlight the sweater.Find some pants. This step is imperative if you intend to leave your home. You wouldn\u2019t believe how much of a fuss people make if you leave your hindquarters unclothed. Make sure you add some matching socks.If it\u2019s cold outside, as it right now where I live, I recommend adding a fleece-lined hat.You don\u2019t have to match the sweater. Even I don\u2019t expect you to have a chartreuse hat lying around. Just go with something that matches either the jacket or the pants.And now you\u2019re ready to head to work!",
            "Chartreuse is a shade between the colors green and yellow, but it is typically considered a sub-category of the color green. The color was named after a French liqueur called \u201cchartreuse\u201d which has a greenish-yellow hue. The liqueur was first produced in 1605 by the Carthusian monks of France, but likely not marketed to the public until the 1730s.

The name of this drink was first used as a color name in the year 1884 when it was mentioned in a British fashion newspaper. During the late 1800\u2019s silk and velvet fabrics were being produced in chartreuse and used to make such stylish items as feather fans, gowns, purses, shoes, and hats. In the roaring 1920s, chartreuse was a very popular choice for dresses because of its bold and rebellious nature. Chartreuse resurged in the late 1950s as a common color choice for clothing and furniture. In the 1960\u2019s, its boldness appealed to young people. It was a unique color that could be used in both psychedelic color-schemes and nature-oriented palettes. Famous fashion designers began incorporating chartreuse heavily into their creations. Though the color fell out of favor in the 1970s, it had a comeback in the late 1980s. In the 2010\u2019s, chartreuse became favored as a decorative color in offices of tech companies because the color reflects individuality and creative thinking which are highly valued attributes in the field of technology. Chartreuse can be seen throughout nature in many different plant species. Some common foods are considered to be chartreuse colored including pears, green apples, pistachios, limes, and avocado flesh. The gemstone tourmaline can be found in the shade of chartreuse. Because it is bright and easy to spot, chartreuse is used for tennis balls, fishing lures, and reflective safety vests. Chartreuse represents enthusiasm, happiness, nature, growth, and youth. Like standard green, chartreuse is associated with the liveliness and the blossoming of spring. Unlike deeper shades of green, chartreuse is rarely associated with calm and relaxation. It\u2019s seen as a highly energetic color and is great for inspiration and motivation. It helps with focus, concentration, and creativity. People who like chartreuse are energetic and creative above all else! Their enthusiasm and positivity make them lovable, and they make friends easily. Chartreuse lovers enjoy challenges and seek adventure. On the negative side, people who gravitate to chartreuse struggle to find balance in their lives. They are caught between the calmness green offers and the excitement of yellow. This struggle can cause them to have high-levels of anxiety.",

No eating, drinking, or smoking while using cadmium pigments, or indeed, many other pigments. Use proper studio ventilation, and always wash your hands, after you wash your brushes.",

And the word gave rise to a religion. And this religion gave rise to a tradition of asceticism. Men of extreme abnegation and devotion to their sacred scriptures renounced the pleasures and blessings of the world and ventured far away to live in solitude, sometimes into the mountains, sometimes into the desert, and even sometimes atop pillars. They were called athletes of God. But a curious thing happened to these men who wanted nothing more than to be left alone to their spiritual pursuits: they acquired not just admirers and emulators but also followers, younger men eager to embark on a similar spiritual journey. In vain, our ascetic athletes tried to shake them off. But the followers were there to stay. Over time, this process became more organized, giving rise to a paradoxical community of would-be loners. The word monastery, with its root monos, still pays silent homage to the original longing for solitude of the unwitting founders of the regular clergy. The high mark of this way of life was the Middle Ages. Monasteries, full of men who, when they weren\u2019t busy praying, spent their days working and learning, became repositories of both scholarship and agricultural productivity. An important part of this agricultural output was the making of wine. Where else was one to find enough blood of Christ for all the sacraments that needed to be performed? Of course, having acquired expertise in wine-making, it wasn\u2019t making too far a leap for monasteries to also start producing other alcoholic beverages. Bruno of Cologne was a philosopher, theologian, and former teacher and mentor to Pope Urban II. He was also the founder of the Carthusian order. It was in a valley of the Chartreuse Mountains that the first modest building of this order was located. Centuries later, it had become a complex of gargantuan proportions, and it is there that a famous liqueur was produced and commercialized in the 18th century from a recipe whose first version goes back to 1605.La Grande Chartreuse. Just as the monastery had been named after the mountain range, the liqueur was named after the monastery.And this characteristic color was named after the liqueur. If you ask me, it\u2019s an underrated color. Here is what you need to do.Get a chartreuse sweater.Add a blue coat. This will serve to contrast with and thereby highlight the sweater.Find some pants. This step is imperative if you intend to leave your home. You wouldn\u2019t believe how much of a fuss people make if you leave your hindquarters unclothed. Make sure you add some matching socks.If it\u2019s cold outside, as it right now where I live, I recommend adding a fleece-lined hat.You don\u2019t have to match the sweater. Even I don\u2019t expect you to have a chartreuse hat lying around. Just go with something that matches either the jacket or the pants.And now you\u2019re ready to head to work!"

But what does caffeine really do, and do the downsides of caffeine outweigh its benefits? What is caffeine? Caffeine is a plant product that may be one of the most widely used stimulants in the world. The average caffeine consumption for Americans is about 2 cups of coffee per day, but you can also find caffeine in tea, chocolate, cocoa, energy drinks, and soda. Caffeine is often referred to as a nutritional ergogenic aid (meaning that it can enhance physical performance), but it has no nutritional value by itself. How does caffeine affect your body? Here\u2019s how it works: after you consume caffeine, it is quickly absorbed from the stomach and peaks in your bloodstream in about 1-2 hours. Since most of your bodily tissues absorb caffeine, it can affect your entire body. Any caffeine that lingers in your bloodstream goes to the liver to be broken down and excreted in urine. How does caffeine affect endurance? When you exercise, your body uses glycogen, a type of sugar that you get from food, for energy. But once those stores are depleted at the end of a long workout, you may feel tired or sluggish\u2014signs that you have \u201chit the wall.\u201d Caffeine slows the depletion of glycogen by encouraging the body to use more fat as fuel, which helps to conserve energy over long periods of time. For this reason sports that deplete a lot of glycogen, specifically endurance events, benefit the most from caffeine consumption. Activities lasting longer than an hour with sustained effort, such as running, cycling, and cross-country skiing, all benefit from caffeine supplementation by allowing athletes to increase their endurance, accuracy, and speed. Conversely, caffeine provides no tangible benefits for strength and power activities, such as weight-lifting. How does caffeine affect cognitive function? Since caffeine enters almost all bodily tissues, it affects your nervous system and your brain. Caffeine acts as a stimulant and wakes you up, which means that when you consume it, you will feel more alert and react faster. Drinking caffeine prior to physical exertion might actually help reduce the perception of pain. According to a study published by the department of kinesiology at the University of Illinois, people who drank caffeine experienced less anxiety associated with strenuous exercise, which may account for their lower perception of pain. For example, if you\u2019ve ever felt your muscles burn during intense exercise, consuming caffeine before you start your workout may dull this sensation. How does caffeine affect hydration? To maintain peak performance, you have to stay hydrated. Water regulates your body temperature, lubricates your joints, and transports nutrients throughout your body. Staying hydrated is particularly important during exercise because you lose water through sweat. The longer and more intensely you work out, the more necessary it becomes to get fluid into your body. When you don\u2019t replenish your fluids, it becomes harder for your heart to circulate blood. A decrease in blood and plasma volume can contribute to muscle cramps, dizziness, fatigue, heat stroke, and heat exhaustion. We\u2019ve all heard the warning that caffeine has a diuretic effect and dehydrates you. However, research shows that this widely-held assumption is actually not true unless you consume a large amount of caffeine. Caffeine does not dehydrate you unless you drink more than 500-600 milligrams (the equivalent of 5-7 cups of coffee) per day. Below this level, your body does not lose any more fluid than the beverage itself provides. For comparison, an 8-ounce cup of coffee has about 100 milligrams of caffeine, and an energy drink can have as much as 242 milligrams per serving (though caffeine content varies between energy drink varieties). While caffeine may cause a little more fluid to be excreted as urine in a 24-hour period when compared to plain water, this effect is fairly mild and does not affect hydration. For anyone who loves coffee, the good news is that caffeinated beverages actually provide a sufficient amount of fluid for rehydration, even among people who exercise regularly in hot, humid conditions. Although caffeine does not appear to have a significant impact on hydration, it can have other effects on your kidneys. One particular study has shown that caffeine can cause increased excretion of sodiumfrom your body, but this usually does not cause problems in normal, healthy adults. However, the salt balance in your body can affect certain medications, so talk to your doctor if you have any questions about any medications that you are taking. Are there any side effects of caffeine? The majority of the studies done on caffeine suggest that people can safely consume up to 3-4 cups of coffee per day. Other caffeinated beverages, such as tea, appear to provide some benefits to your health. However, the key with caffeine is to consume it in moderation. People who drink caffeine in excess (more than 300 milligrams or four cups of brewed coffee per day) report feeling jittery and anxious, and may feel stomach pain and heart palpitations. Keep in mind that one cup of coffee is about eight ounces, so if you tend to order a large coffee (which can range anywhere from 24-32 ounces), remember to count that as the appropriate amount of servings! For some people, caffeine can have a profound effect on sleep, even if they consume it many hours before going to bed. However, conflicting research shows that caffeine will not measurably effect sleep duration in most healthy adults. Basically, if you have trouble sleeping, avoiding caffeine may be one way to help manage this problem. Caffeine can have some serious downsides for certain groups of people who are more susceptible to its effects. The elderly, children and teens, pregnant women, those with high blood pressure, anxiety, or heart disease should avoid caffeine completely. If you\u2019re concerned about how caffeine may affect your health, you should speak with your doctor. Can coffee make me gain weight? A plain cup of black coffee has only about two calories and no fat. Since plain coffee does not contain enough calories to provide energy for your body\u2019s cells, it should not cause weight gain. However, once you start adding milk, cream, sugar, or other flavorings, the calories can begin to add up. For example, one tablespoon of cream can add about 50 calories to your beverage, whereas an equivalent of half-and-half contains 20 calories, and skim milk might contain only 5 calories. Some popular coffee drinks are as sweet as desserts and can contain hundreds of calories! Many brands of energy drinks deliver their jolt in the form of caffeine and sugar, so make sure to check the nutrition label on your drink to figure out if your form of caffeine is also going to help you pack on the pounds. When it comes to weight gain, all calories count\u2014even the liquid ones\u2014so watch what you\u2019re adding to your drink! While caffeine does have a performance-enhancing effect for some athletes, be careful how you use it! The effects of caffeine can vary from person to person, so make sure that you know how your body is going to respond before chugging coffee right before an important competition. Otherwise, enjoy your cup of Joe! I love these questions as they are helpful for others as well. Visit my Quora profile to discover more about me. Robert",

And you can be sure that she'll be able to get her hands on those more easily than a cup or two of high quality coffee (which you'll make for her, right?)

When you read the word \"drug\" immediately the association with something \"bad\" comes to your head, however, that is not how you think it. It is said to be a drug due to the stimulating effect that caffeine has on our nervous system. And for years it has been debated whether coffee is good or bad for your health and I will try to give you the answer in a simple way: It is good but not in excess. As with a large part of the things in our life, problems arise when there are excesses and coffee is no exception. And it will also depend on your state of health. For example, if you have intestinal problems, coffee may not be a good drink for you and you have to look for other alternatives. Another point that is worth highlighting, beyond the amount you consume per day, refers to the quality of the coffee. Today there are very few who really consume quality coffee. Most think they drink coffee but in reality they are drinking those caloric bombs, loaded with sugars that they sell to us in the commercial premises. Good quality coffee, from freshly ground grain, is a source of antioxidants that could help with weight loss. Although it does have its negative effects such as heartburn and irritable bowel. But they are adverse effects that do not affect everyone equally. There will be those who are more sensitive to them if they abuse it. So for me, the ideal coffee would be freshly ground grain and without any type of sweetener or sweetener. With a splash of milk, which could be cow or some type of vegetable milk. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you liked my answer, I would appreciate it if you would leave me your positive vote and share it with another coffee lover like me so that he knows that it is not bad but not too much...",

But these studies didn\u2019t account for unhealthy behaviors, like smoking, that were often associated with coffee drinking at the time, rendering those findings largely invalid. More recent studies have actually suggested there may be certain coffee-related health benefits, further buoying coffee\u2019s reputation. But there are still ups and downs. Many of the downsides of coffee are related to the caffeine content that makes the drink so appealing in the morning. Dangerous caffeine overdoses generally don\u2019t occur with coffee, but the unpleasant effects of too much caffeine \u2013 like anxiety, GI upset, and palpitations \u2013 can occur. And for those who become dependent on a morning cup of joe (myself included), caffeine withdrawal can be uncomfortable, causing symptoms like headache, fatigue, and irritability. Independent of caffeine content, coffee can also exacerbate gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in certain people, so if you get heartburn or an upset stomach after drinking coffee, stay away. Many people worry that coffee can induce arrhythmias in susceptible individuals, but this has never been shown to be true in moderate amounts (up to 4 cups per day). On the other hand, there are major potential upsides to the coffee habit. In observational studies, people who drink coffee regularly appear to have lower rates of diabetes, stroke, heart disease, certain cancers, and dementia. And more recent studies have even shown that coffee drinkers seem to have lower all-cause mortality \u2013 that\u2019s death from any cause \u2013 than non-coffee drinkers. Studies like these show association, not causation, but many experts think that a causative relationship between coffee drinking and improved health is plausible given coffee\u2019s high antioxidant content. In the short-term, coffee can also boost mood, alertness, mental energy, and concentration, which should come as a surprise to almost no one. My verdict: though there isn\u2019t enough evidence to recommend that everyone start drinking coffee for good health, daily coffee drinkers shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about the habit. In fact, as the science continues to evolve, we may find that drinking coffee could be one of the healthier things you can do.",

Recently it has been shown in a large study that coffee, caffeinated or not is associated with lower overall mortality.2. Coffee has long been a subject of heated discussions. It has been praised or condemned. Many studies have been done in the past; some showed health benefits, some did not. A new, larger study [ http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2015/11/10/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.017341.abstract?sid=f9171c51-1b1d-4d35-ac9c-9f3a793a7cb7 ] was done by the Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, MA to re-examine this issue for both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.3. Mortality was determined among 74,890 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study (NHS), 93,054 women in the NHS 2, and 40,557 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study after a medium follow-up of 22.5 years. 19,524 women and 12,432 men died during that time period. Ming Ding is a doctoral student in the Harvard School of Public Health department of nutrition and was the lead author of the study that was published in the medical journal \u201cCirculation\u201d. She pointed out that in the past there were confounding problems: although many studies had shown that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumption lowered the risk of cardiovascular disease, the results in many studies were blurred. Studies often did not distinguish between smokers and nonsmokers; so a beneficial effect from coffee drinking was wiped out by the cardiovascular risk from smoking.4. Ding\u2019s studies took this into account and also other confounding factors like how much sugary soda pop people were drinking and whether or not they were eating well. In addition they normalized for other factors that could interfere like drinking alcohol and eating red meat. Without normalizing for the factors mentioned above the study results were as follows. Study participants had less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had a 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit.5. However, when all the confounding factors were removed and the various groups were compared again the following emerged:  * Less than 1 cup of coffee per day: 6% lower death rates than non-coffee drinkers. * 1 cup to 3 cups of coffee per day: 8% lower death rates. * 3 to 5 cups of coffee per day: 15% lower death rates. * More than 5 cups of coffee per day: 12% lower death rates. Ming Ding was associated with another research paper [ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24459154 ] that had shown that coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and heart disease. She found that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee reduced the risk of getting diabetes later in life. When asked about what would be responsible for the reduced death rates with coffee consumption, Ding explained: \u201cThere are at least two known chemicals in coffee, namely lignans and chlorogenic acid that could reduce inflammation and help control blood sugar, both of which could help reduce the risk of heart disease\u201d. Although there seems to be a linear response up to 5 cups of coffee consumption, above 5 cups this linear relationship disappeared. It was not explained whether there was a saturation point reached, whether there was yet another hidden confounding factor or whether there were detrimental effects on the adrenal glands with too much coffee consumption. Another finding was that it did not matter whether the coffee was regular (caffeinated) coffee or decaffeinated coffee. The results were identical. Many other studies did not have the large numbers to show whether or not decaffeinated coffee was as effective in preventing heart disease. 6. Finally, there was another peculiar finding; suicides were down by 20% to 36%, if a person drank at least one cup of coffee per day. But if a person consumed less than 1 cup of coffee per day the suicide rate was 36% higher than the control group with no coffee co...",

I will add in two people and their relationship with coffee. My husband is a coffee addict - black, no sugar. None of that light/medium roast - he needs the strong stuff or he might as well be drinking water. He even drinks it like he drinks water. The good news is that he has since stopped drinking as much, but he \"needs\" 1 to 2 cups a day, which is a lot better than before. I think it's just all in his head. You don't need it - he's literally addicted and if he doesn't get coffee or at least doesn't get what he deems is enough, he'll get a headache. The only reason why he stopped drinking as much is because he was getting stomachaches - there is a certain amount of acid in coffee and it's not quite good for your stomach, especially if it's your main source of liquid. Another note: he used to drink Frappuccinos all the time while in college. I didn't know him then, but I saw a photo of him. He's slim now, but at the time, he was a bit on the chunky side. Those Fraps contain enough calories (and not enough nutrients) as a full meal... and on top of that, he always gets the largest size. And there you have it: if you drink too much, you get addicted, headaches, and even stomachaches. If you drink too many fatty/sugary coffee-concoctions, you gain weight. Who knows? You may even be a candidate for diabetes. Then there's me. I currently don't drink a lot of coffee, but I do indulge once in a while in a latte/cappuccino or a Frap, which is always shared. However, when I lived in Korea, home to the land of amazing independent (and cute) coffee shops, I drank coffee on a near daily basis, ranging from Americanos to cappuccinos. Sometimes, I even had two of them. This is in addition to the instant coffee mixes Koreans love, which I normally drank after lunch. I didn't notice too much of a difference until one day, I didn't drink my usual cup of caffeine. I was practicing for my taekwondo class and while holding a form, I noticed that my arms were shaking. Uncontrollably. I also felt a little jittery and \"off\". It was a sign: too much coffee. My body was becoming addicted. I immediately stopped and limited myself to one a day - at the most. I also started delving into non-coffee-based drinks offered at these coffee shops.  So, again: don't drink too much. Now, if I drink a cup of coffee when I need it, then I feel fine. However, I found out that when I drink it recreationally, then I tend to develop a headache within the next 30 minutes. I don't know why this started happening when I used to drink it at my leisure before, but I guess I just drank too much back then."

That means a heavy saute pan, pair of tongs and a digital meat thermometer. A heavy pan (stainless steel clad, heavy gauge aluminum, cast iron, whatever) is essential. A heavy pan will hold the heat, meaning its temperature won\u2019t drop appreciably when you put cold steak in the pan, allowing you to get a good sear on the meat. A good sear is essential for your steak to have the color, texture and flavor you associate with a well cooked steak. Tongs are for flipping the steak and pulling it out of the pan when it is done. You aren\u2019t doing that with your hands, a spoon or by piercing it with a fork. Those things just aren\u2019t done, so get a pair of metal tongs. Finally, a digital thermometer will tell you when your steak is done. Start by seasoning the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. For a 12 to 16 oz steak you should start with 1/4 tsp of kosher salt and 1/8 tsp of black pepper on each side. If you find the steak to be under seasoned, just add more at the table and adjust the next time you cook one. Season the steak about 30 minutes before you begin cooking and let it hang out on the counter during that time. Nothing bad is going to happen, just cook the steak, it\u2019ll be okay. Now put your pan on the stove over medium high heat. Wait a couple of minutes and add about 1/2 oz cooking oil to the pan. Any common cooking oil will do. When you see some wisps of smoke coming from the oil, you will add the steak. Slowly add the steak to the pan, letting it fall away from you, so you don\u2019t splash yourself with hot oil. Now leave it alone. You want to develop a once even brown crust, which is great looking, gives the steak a nice texture and is full of flavor. This will take a couple of minutes, but it\u2019s safe to take a peek by lifting the steak a little with your tongs. When it looks like this:gently flip the steak with your tongs and begin to cook the second side. The second side won\u2019t get as nice a crust as the one you\u2019re looking at, which is fine, you\u2019re objective now is to cook the steak to your desired doneness. Now is when the thermometer comes into play. Typically, steaks are cooked to a temperature range, which corresponds with a doneness. Rare would be 120 to 130. Medium rare is usually 130 to 135. Medium is 135 to 145. Medium well is 145 to 155 and well is anything above 155 degrees. Once you\u2019ve flipped the steak, let it cook for about two to three minutes, so it gets some color on the second side, and then take its temperature. Just stick the thermometer into the thickest part of the steak, probing in half way to the center. You don\u2019t want to go further than half way into the steak because then you\u2019ll be taking the temperature of the pan, not the steak. Most likely, the steak won\u2019t be more than rare at this point. Since you\u2019re a novice to steak cooking, temping early will give you an idea of where the steak is right now and you can better gauge the time it will take to raise its internal temperature to where you want it to be. So, wait a couple of minutes and temp it again. The last pieces to good steak cooking technique is understanding the need to rest the steak and carry over cooking. When you\u2019ve decide on the temperature range you want your steak to be cooked to, pull it out when it is about 5 degrees below your target temp. So, if you want a medium steak, pull it out at 130 degrees, not 135. The reason being, you\u2019re going to let the steak rest for about 8 to 10 minutes before you serve it. Resting the steak gives the muscle fibers time to relax and the steak to retain moisture. Muscle fibers contract when heated, forcing out precious flavorful juices that make your steak moist. If you cut into the steak as soon as you pull it from the pan, a lot of that moisture is going to run out, onto your plate. You don\u2019t want that, so let it rest. As the steak rests, it will also continue to cook, even overcook. That\u2019s why you want to pull it from the pan before it reaches your target temp. This is called carry over cooking. Some people don\u2019t know about carry over cooking and they always serve overcooked steaks, even if they are using a meat thermometer. So, to recap: heavy pan, medium high heat, season both sides salt and pepper, wisps of smoke from the oil, lay the steak into the pan away from you, leave it alone and allow a crust to form, flip the steak, let it cook a couple of minutes, probe it with the thermometer half way in at the thickest part, pull it when it is 5 degrees less than the desired temperature, let it rest and then dig in. There are a million ways to embellish a steak. Half of the answers you receive will recommend one or two things you can do to make your steak more interesting or more exciting. Most of them will be legit and you should feel free to experiment with any that sound exciting to you, after you\u2019ve mastered the basic technique I just laid out for you. Learn the two basic principles I just explained: developing flavor by properly seasoning and searing the steak, and cooking it to the desired temperature without fail. Once you\u2019ve mastered those essential steps, then embellish the steak with more advanced techniques. Before long, you'll be cooking amazing steaks, just don\u2019t put the cart before the horse.

I need to give credit to experts like The Food Lab and Kenji Lopez-Alt and America\u2019s Test Kitchen. They\u2019ve all done the experiments to bust common myths and arrive at a perfect steak. So let\u2019s go. You have four basic goals when cooking a steak:Seasoning the steakHeating the inside of the steak to reach a uniform temperature according to your tastes (for instance, my family prefers medium rare, but tastes vary)Searing the outside of the steak to have a tasty crustHaving the steaks ready with the rest of the mealSeasoning the Steak The most important seasoning is salt. If you only add one seasoning to a steak, it has to be salt\u2014it\u2019s that important. Others that are common: garlic, black pepper, and a variety of spices (coriander, cayenne, oregano, many others). But let\u2019s bust a myth right at the start here: marinades do not soak into a steak, except for salt and to a lesser extent water soluble seasonings such as onion and garlic. Being water soluble they can diffuse into meat, and the salt will actually help the meat stay moist during cooking. But every other ingredient in your marinade? It\u2019s delicious, but it just sticks to the surface. America\u2019s Test Kitchen did a blind taste test where they marinated chicken in various flavors for 18 hours, then shaved off the outside 1\u20133 millimeters (a thin skin) and then asked people if they could tell the difference. They could not. So if you like to marinate steaks with \u201ca secret family marinade,\u201d just realize you don\u2019t need to do it much in advance, if at all. The only thing that\u2019s \u201csinking in\u201d is the salt portion. A great technique for all meats is to brine them\u2014basically cover them in salt or salt water and let them sit for a day or two in the fridge to give the meat time to absorb some salt. Then when you cook them you can slather them with whatever flavorings you want, and that way you\u2019re not slowing down your salt absorption with a bunch of stuff that\u2019s not going to soak in anyway, but will just get in the way of the salt. Tip: one convenient seasoning to use is Montreal Seasoning, which is a pre-mixed blend of salt, black pepper, garlic, coriander, red pepper, paprika, and sometimes dill. Available in most stores. Heating the Inside When it comes to the inside of the steak, ideally you want every bit of it cooked exactly to whatever doneness you prefer (for instance, medium rare). Traditionally, that\u2019s been hard to do, because usually the outside of the steak ends up more well done than the inside, and you get this gradation from more cooked at the outside to less cooked in the middle. When the very center gets to medium rare (dark pink to red), the outside third is often more of a medium (pink) or even well done (no color). You\u2019re getting a mix of donenesses. But what if there was a way to make the entire center the exact some color every time? Ah, but there is. Rather than blasting very high heat on the outside of the meat and subjecting it to that long enough for heat to migrate into the inside meat, what you\u2019d ideally do is to cook the meat at the temperature you\u2019re aiming for, for instance 135\u00b0F (57.2\u00b0C), and do everything you can to avoid drying out the meat in the process. Fancy prime rib restaurants most often do this in an oven at very low temperature, and it can take a number of hours. They\u2019ll typically baste the meat with juices to rehydrate it along the way, or use an oven that provides a very moist environment. But there\u2019s a better way, and it doesn\u2019t involve an oven. You take the steak and put it in a ziploc bag, sucking out all of the air with a straw so that it looks vacuum packed. Then you drop it in a basin of water maintained at the exact temperature you want the inside of the steak to be. For instance, medium rare is 135\u00b0F (57.2\u00b0C). Because there is no air and it is directly in water, the temperature can be managed very accurately and efficiently\u2014much more so than when using an oven. The physics of this is that conduction (two liquids or solids in direct contact) transfers heat much more efficiently than convection (being heated by contact with air). And you\u2019re not exposing your meat to a drying environment. In just an hour, you can perfectly cook the inside of the meat to your perfect doneness. Completely evenly. To make your own water bath like this, you purchase a small temperature-controlled water circulator that clips to the side of a pan or tub and exactly regulates the water temperature. They cost as little as $49, and the process is called sous vide (pronounced like Sue Veed, French for \u201cin vacuum\u201d). You can buy them lots of places. You can get fancy with it, and buy custom tubs and vacuum sealing equipment. Or you can go cheap and buy discount ziploc bags and a plastic tub from Target for $4. Works just as well. When you take the steaks out of the water and their bags, the inside is evenly cooked all the way through to perfect doneness, but the outside is an unattractive gray color.Photo courtesy Anova Searing Get rid of that gray color by searing the outside at very high temperature. Searing gives you that dark crust on the outside that you get at a fancy restaurant, and it also makes the steak taste a lot better. There\u2019s chemistry involved. Searing causes what is known as a Maillard reaction to occur on the surface of the steak. This forms amino acids and sugars that are the delicious hallmark of a well-seared steak. Okay, another myth to bust: \u201csearing locks in the juices of the meat, and should be done first.\u201d Nope, searing does NOT lock in moisture and can be done at any time. There\u2019s no \u201clocking in of moistness\u201d (people have tested this), just the Maillard reaction for flavor. What\u2019s most important to realize when searing after sous vide is that the meat is already cooked after sous vide. All you are trying to do when searing is to heat-treat the outside of the meat. Under very high searing temperatures 500\u20131000\u00b0F (260\u2013540\u00b0C) you only need to sear for about 2 minutes. That\u2019s it, 2 minutes total, no matter how thick the steak or roast may be. Just to drive the point home: it takes the same amount of time to sear a 4\u2033 thick roast as it does a thin 1\u2033 steak. My preferred method of searing is just over a very hot bed of charcoal, about 2\u2033 away. Wait until the rest of the meal is ready, towel dry the outside of the steaks, spray with a high smoke point oil like canola or peanut\u2014or if you\u2019re fancy brush with beef Wagyu tallow\u2014then drop the steaks on the grill. They may pretty quickly flame up\u2014and that\u2019s fine, as long as you flip them every 30 seconds or so. I like to create cross hatch stripes, by searing 30 seconds in each direction on both sides for a total of 2 minutes. You\u2019re finished when the color is exactly where you want it. And instead of dreading flare ups, you just use them. Just don\u2019t forget that the meat is already cooked perfectly inside when you begin searing. You\u2019re so used to standing there for a certain amount of time at the grill, but you have to fight that inclination. Sear it quickly and get it off the grill. Some gas grills have a special searing section that is much hotter than the rest of the grill, but in general a gas grill is not great for searing. Instead, it will take too long to sear and that heat will have time to soak in and cause your perfect doneness to be compromised. [Update] Setting up a charcoal grill may be less convenient than many people would like, but there are other ways to sear, such as using a very, very hot cast iron pan and/or a very hot 500\u00b0F (260\u00b0C) oven. I began with those methods, but for various reasons (smoke in the house, the cleanup of the pan) I\u2019ve switched to using a charcoal grill almost all of the time. Having the Steaks Done on Time By now you may have picked up how different the process of sous vide + sear is from normal grilling. Instead of a tricky dance where you try to time the meat cooking to finish at the exact needed moment, you can relax\u2014and be confident of a perfect steak every time.The steaks can wait in the sous vide as long as you need them toThe searing takes just two minutes.The steaks will always be perfectSo no rushed cooking that results in raw centers, or overcooked steaks because you left them on too long. It does require a little advance planning to drop the steaks in the water an hour or two before dinner time. And the process does get slightly more complicated if people want different donenesses. You can achieve that one of two ways:Ideally, you have separate sous vide baths for each donenessAlternatively, you can use an area of the grill with less intense heat to additionally cook the more well done steaks before you sear them allNow that we have sold our friends and neighbors on the benefits of sous vide (which sounds super fancy but is not once you\u2019ve done it), we can just run next door and borrow a second tub and heater and have one medium (or well done) tub and one medium-rare tub. If you\u2019re interested in my own personal taste, I\u2019m firmly in the medium rare camp, because I like to keep as much tenderness as possible without eating raw meat. Though there are some very high end cuts of meat (like kobe) that I would not hesitate to even cook even less. There you have it: perfect steaks every time! Bonus TipsBrush a little butter on after searing. Yum.Sous vide + searing is magic for very thick cuts of meat like tritip or giant 2\u2033 tomahawk steaks or even prime rib. Don\u2019t fear the thick cuts any more! They will be perfect, too.If you leave the meat in sous vide longer than a couple of hours, it begins to break down the collagen (toughness) in the meat. For instance, if you overnight sous vide a big tritip it will be super tender and especially good for sandwiches.A great style of charcoal grill to use is called an Argentine grill. It lets you adjust the distance between the charcoal and the grate so that you can cook (further away) and sear (close up) as needed.Toss a few little chunks of fruit or nut wood (I like apple, cherry, pecan) into the charcoal before you begin searing. The little bit of smokiness it adds will contribute an extra amazing layer of flavor to the meat.References Food Myths Busted by America\u2019s Test Kitchen When to Sear a Perfect Steak: Reverse Searing The Maillard Reaction and Flavor Sous Vide Cookers on Amazon 7 Myths About Cooking Steak That Need to Go Away For the Perfect Grilled Steak, Don't Let It Rest",

The red, bloody juices freaked me out. Ewwwww\u2026. Then I went to my boyfriend\u2019s parent\u2019s house for Christmas dinner, where they served a medium rare full tenderloin. I'm almost sure that I married that man because he converted me to eating properly cooked steak. WOW!! What a difference! Since then, I've ordered a beautiful filet every chance I've had at nice restaurants and steak houses. But my real challenge, has been perfecting my steak at home. Who can afford a $50 steak once a week? Not this girl. So I grilled them. I pan fried them. I cooked them in a cast iron, and finished them under the broiler. I made some really tasty steaks. I could get a lovely crust, and a beautiful medium rare center. A really tasty steak, all in all. But with a 1.5 inch steak, only about half of it ended up actually medium rare, while the edges still tended to be much more done. Here's an example of what I mean (not my photo).I would have been happy with this steak if I prepared it at home. Then I discovered sous vide cooking. It's not as intimidating as it sounds, and not as expensive as it used to be. Lots of people rave about sous vide steak, but many still don't get it quite right. I've managed to make supermarket beef tenderloin taste better than most steaks I've ordered in nice restaurants (excluding quality steakhouses with aged beef). I've found the key to be PRE SEARING the meat. Get a cast iron skillet searing hot and add a high temp oil or clarified butter. Season your tenderloin heavily with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper (don't worry about over salting- most of it doesn't stick). Start with a cold steak and sear on both sides to get a nice brown crust. Put the steak in a vacuum seal bag (or ziplock bag, using water immersion to remove air), and place in a sous vide bath set at 130 degrees (I've found the final cook temp tends to be about 1 degree below my set temp on my sous vide immersion circulator) for 2 hours. When the time is up, reheat your cast iron to scorching hot, reseason the steak with salt and pepper, and give it another very quick sear on each side. The reason for this, is that a sous vide steak generally comes out quite gray and looks unappetizing. A final sear is always recommended to get a nice crust. BUT- this final sear can very often overcook the edges of the steak! What's the point of bothering with sous vide if you can't get edge-to-edge perfection? The first sear is done on a cold steak, so it doesn't cook much more than the very outer layer. The final sear is very fast, so again, the steak can't be overcooked. My first attempt using this method made me a convert. The ONLY way I could make my home steaks better would be to use high quality dry aged beef. I really think I could rival a top steakhouse in quality with access to that kind of meat. Here is my lovely edge-to-edge medium rare perfection using this method. Try not to drool\u2026..A final note- I've used this method at different temperatures, and have ended up with my steak too rare for my liking. You know what?? It was still delicious! For me, overly rare steak is off-putting because the texture feels raw to me. However, because the steak cooks at this low temp for so long, the undercooked texture disappears when cooked using this method. Who knew I could eat a rare steak, when a few years ago I would barely touch it if it was medium well\u2026. EDIT: So, this is silly, but I'm pretty new to Quora, so it's pretty cool to have so many views and upvotes. Thanks y'all!",

I believe they turn out exceptionally well seasoned, perfect mid rare or rare depending on how my guests want them. 95% of the time I serve filets. My husband prefers rib eye, yet he has been won over by my filets as I hand trim them and you can eat every bite and unlike a rib eye, there are never any pieces of fat or chewy/ gristly pieces. I get large thick filets, minimum 3/4 lb-1lb steaks. Go big or go home. I trim off any silver skin a lazy butcher has left on and LARGE outer chunks of fat. Interior marveling is what counts in steak, not exterior pieces of fat. No one eats that, get rid of it. You can season a couple of ways, but either way starts the same: thoroughly DRY your steaks with paper towel. If you aren\u2019t going to cook them right away, you can put them in the fridge. You can salt them now, or not. I usually salt them. Coarse ground kosher. It\u2019s all I use. No other seasoning at this point, just the salt. An hour before you\u2019re ready to cook, pull the steaks out, rinse. The steaks will have absorbed some salt, pulled out some liquid, done it\u2019s little dance and you don\u2019t want a salty liquid on the surface of your steak. Rinse under cool water, dry. Dry WELL. Let rest for an hour. Do not season yet. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. Keep your instant read meet thermometer handy. Once your steaks have tested for the hour, dry again if necessary. Now season. Coarse kosher salt. No pepper. You\u2019re going to sear your steaks and you don\u2019t want burnt pepper. Now, my favorite seasoning for steaks is Stubbs Beef Spice Rub. Put a decent amount, about a tsp on each side and rub in. Have handy: butter, rosemary or thyme and slightly smashed garlic cloves. In your very hot cast iron pan, heat your preferred oil (I like clarified bacon grease\ud83e\udd70) with a high smoke point such as safflower oil, avocado oil, tasting olive oil and get the oil to where it starts to shimmer. Place your steaks (don\u2019t overcrowd or you\u2019ll steam not sear) and PRESS them into the pan to make sure all the surface has contact with the pan. Leave each steak there 2 minutes if they\u2019re average size. I go up to 3 with my Godzilla steaks. Flip. Now dust with cracked pepper if desired. 2\u20133 minutes. If you\u2019re doing large steaks, do each side for 30 seconds or so. Then reduce heat, drop in butter in 1 tbsp pads a couple stems of preferred thyme/ rosemary and smashed garlic saut\u00e9 in pan around the steaks until flavors meld, then tilt pan and baste steaks with...",

Other popular seasonings include garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and herbs like thyme or rosemary. The ideal proportions of seasonings depend on personal taste, but a good starting point is to use about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of salt and pepper per pound of steak, and adjust to taste. The ideal degree of cooking also varies based on personal preference. For optimum deliciousness, a medium-rare to medium steak is often recommended, as it allows the meat to retain its juiciness and natural flavors while still being cooked through. However, the best degree of cooking ultimately depends on your individual taste preferences.",
            "Here\u2019s how I do it. First, buy a steak that either has a reasonable amount of marbling, such as ribeye, or is lean but flavourful, such as onglet.

If you aren\u2019t going to do that, season the steak hours before cooking, preferably overnight, with lots of black pepper and some sea salt. Yes, I want the salt to draw some of the juice out of the steak. Not too much, however. I can always salt the steak after cooking if I really don\u2019t want to look after my heart. Steve Albini dry-ages his steak in the fridge for weeks before cooking it. I think that this is because American steak tends not to be aged; Americans may correct me. In the UK you can buy 21-day dry-aged steak in supermarkets. Take steak from fridge about an hour before cooking, to let it get to room temperature. Edit: This doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s not going to come to room temperature after being in the fridge all night. Alright, back to the original answer again. Do whatever you need to do to prepare something to eat with the steak. Like, preparing vegetables of some kind. Personally, I like a plain baked potato and some salad, but you do you. Sometimes I warm a ciabatta roll in the oven, cut it, spread one side with mustard and strew it with rocket (arugula) and watercress. If you\u2019re going with the marinaded flank option, I suggest serving it with a salad of watercress, avocado and toasted walnut halves. Take a cast iron griddle pan like this:\u2014and heat it over the highest heat you can get. I use a wok burner on my hob, which is bigger and fiercer than a regular burner. You want that thing hot. There will be smoke. Make about 450ml of stock using either prepared stock cubes/condensed stock, hot water and a glass of red wine. If you don\u2019t know how much 450ml is, look it up. I\u2019m not your unit converter. Keep the stock aside. Have a warm plate handy. This is where it gets tense. You need some way of telling the time. A stopwatch or timer on your phone will do. Brush steak with olive oil. Slap it on the griddle. Billows of smoke. Let it sit there for a minute at least. Do not poke it, prod it or press it. After a minute, nudge it. It should be cooked enough that it comes away from the griddle fairly easily. If it doesn\u2019t, give it another 30 seconds until it does. If it sticks, it hasn\u2019t formed the right crust yet. When it no longer sticks, rotate it without flipping it, about 30 degrees, to maximise the amount of meat that will get browned from the griddle\u2019s bars. Leave it another minute or so. Then flip it and repeat. You should cook it for 4\u20135 minutes, no longer. This is assuming that your steak is less than an inch thick. If it\u2019s an inch or more thick, good for you but you\u2019ll need to cook it for longer unless you want it to be blue in the middle. I used to like steaks like that, but I\u2019ve come to prefer medium rare. If you like steak well done, read somebody else\u2019s recipe. When it has that really good brown/black crust on at least one side, and poking it makes it yield but then return to its original shape, remove to warm plate and let sit for 10 minutes. (Here\u2019s how to use the texture of steak to check if it\u2019s perfectly cooked: prod it. If the indentation remains, it\u2019s raw in the middle. If the indentation gently rises back to its original shape, it\u2019s done right. If you can\u2019t put a dent in it with your finger, a cow died in vain.) Letting it sit is crucial. Being heated causes the steak to tense up and contract, and it\u2019s squeezing out its own juices like a sponge. Letting it sit relaxes it; the muscle fibres will stop contracting and the juices will stop being squeezed out. Yes, it\u2019ll cool down a little but warm juicy steak is better than hot steak with all the juice squeezed out of it. While it\u2019s sitting, remove griddle from heat and pour stock onto it. It will produce clouds of scalding steam. Try not to get injured. Return griddle to heat and let that liquid boil down to a syrupy consistency. When it has that, pour jus over steak. This will add more flavour and incidentally warm up your steak a little. If you don\u2019t drink alcohol, just use stock but you may like a splash of balsamic vinegar; a little acid is handy. Eat. Use whatever condiments you like. If your smoke alarm goes off while cooking your steak, remember to take the steak off the heat before batting wildly at the air in front of your smoke alarm. If you don\u2019t, it will overcook.",

If you can't decide, try a T-bone or porterhouse as combine a strip and a tenderloin. Stay away from any shoulder, blade or chuck cuts (flatiron steaks are actually a cut from the chuck). Those aren't particular well-suited to high-heat, short duration cooking methods that \"steak\" is known for.  Thick means at least 3/4\" and up.  Thicker cuts cut down your chance of overcooking and drying out the meat. Salt is your friend, salt does interesting things on a chemical molecular level to cells. It draws out moisture and denatures protein.  These are all good things to do to steak as it improves flavor and increases tenderness.  Aging meat is a process that causes similar things to happen using natural enzymes and time.  Salt is your shortcut.  The only prep you need to do is bring the meat close to room temperature then salt it very liberally. I mean it should look like a salt lick.  I use 2 tablespoons per side of a 1-inch think 16 oz ribeye.  Let it rest for about half-hour to an hour.  You should see significant moisture pooling on and around the steak.  Rinse off all the salt and juice and pat the steak dry.  Season with any other flavors you may want.  Start with nothing but a couple grinds of the pepper mill and keep experimenting until you find what you like. While you were letting your steak rest, you should have gone out to your charcoal grill and light it with a chimney starter.  That's a canister with a handle and a grate at the bottom that allows for you to load the top with charcoal and stuff the bottom with newspaper to quickly light the coals.  This will be your salamander broiler that restaurants use to sear the daylights out of your steak giving it that great crust.  Those broilers use high-heat (700F+) elements just above your steak.  It cooks without flareups of traditional grill because the heat is above the fat that drips off your steak won't ignite. When your steak is salted, rinsed, and dried, your coals should be burning red hot. Here's the tricky part: Shake your starter to get all the loose coal bits out and get rid of the newspaper remnants, if any. Put your steak on the grill and gently place the roaring-hot chimney start over the steak. Hold it there for 90 seconds. Your steak will bubble and sizzle like nothing else with the blazing coals millimeters from it. Gently remove the chimney and shake it out again somewhere else over the grill. Flip your steak and repeat for another 90 seconds on the other side. You should have a perfect sear and char on both sides now. Empty the coals into the other side of the grill and cover and cook until desired doneness over indirect heat. You should figure out how to determine temperature by feel. Don't bother with time estimates as they are generally averages and vary by quite bit with too many variables (like thickness, initial temperature, cut) affecting the final outcome. You can use an internal thermometer but just learn one simple trick to help guide you. Poke your steak with your finger. How does it feel? Compare with this guide. Look at your open palm (doesn't matter which one) and touch your index finger to your thumb forming and \"OK\" sign. Now poke that fleshy pad under your thumb that connects your thumb to the rest of your palm. That's what rare feels like. Now touch your middle finger to your thumb. Poke that pad again, it's a little stiffer. That's mid-rare. Ringer finger to thumb is medium. Little finger to thumb equals medium-well. Anything harder than that is just a roast.  Just keep testing every minute or so until you reach your desired temperature.  You'll eventually figure out how long it takes to get there. Take your finished steak off the grill and tent with foil and let it rest 5 minutes or so.  Get the rest of your meal together and your steak will be ready for slicing.  When slicing, find the grain of the muscle by looking for the fibers and then cutting perpendicular to those fibers.  Enjoy the flavor! This is not the easiest or quickest method and demands that you make small adjustments to find your sweet spot.  It's a very personal thing how one likes their steak.  Like any food prep, it gets better with practice.  This method is best for the not-quite-USDA-Prime cuts.  The salting will enhance flavor and texture of all steaks.",

Many years back, my mother was frying chicken, not noticing that my baby brother, back then, managed to enter the kitchen and was crawling around. He touched her leg, gave her a fright and before she knew it, the pot had flipped, and the boiling oil spilled on my brother's face. He got a huge burn on more than half his face. She thought she ruined his life forever. My mother's first instinct was to grab some ice and quickly place it on the burn. But she decided to call my father who's a doctor first, thankfully. And he told her to never put ice or even very cold water on such a burn or it will only damage the tissue. Instead, \u201cthe best thing to do for a minor burn is to cool it off by running the burned area under cool water for about 5 minutes. You can also apply a clean, cool, wet cloth.\u201d[1] And that's exactly what she did before taking him to the hospital. Thankfully, they gave him the proper care, and after a few months of using proper creams and honey to cover the wound, it was nowhere to be seen. It helped a lot that he was still a growing baby so his skin recovered fast. But yeah, if she had acted on her instinct, and placed ice on it, who knows how that would've affected my brother's face to this day?Footnotes[1] Should You Put Ice on a Burn (or Not)?",

I\u2019m not sure how common this misconception is but it\u2019s common enough that it happened at least twice back in my EMT days. The worst part is the party that acted poorly were immediate family members of original patient and should have known better. I use the word poorly because I think calling them dumb or stupid may be too harsh. Stay with me. We get a call of a male adult having a grand mal seizure. My partner and I arrive at the house and immediately recognize the house because we\u2019ve been there before for this same reason.. We had treated this 30 year old male patient once or twice before for his epilepsy. This is understandable. Often times meds need to be adjusted to keep the seizures at bay. But, this time, something was very different. As we are unloading our gurney, the man\u2019s 55 year old mother comes running out of the front door holding her left hand in a towel. Upon inspection, we find that nearly all of the index finger on her left hand was gone and blood was spurting from the 1 inch of what remained. I\u2019m guessing most of you can tell what occurred without me telling you but what fun would that be? There was a 3rd party there, probably a sister of the patient who had smartly called 911 when she recognized that \u201caura\u201d type stare on the patient\u2019s face when he went silent mid sentence. This young epileptic man fell into a full tonic clonic seizure. It ended after about 45 seconds. For a worried mother, this was probably an eternity. I\u2019m assuming that it was during this short time that we got the call to respond. Someone had informed this mother that what you do next is stick an object like a pen or\u2026 her finger\u2026 in the patient\u2019s mouth to take control of his tongue. Well\u2026 unfortunately he went into a second seizure and promptly bit his mother\u2019s finger off, unwillingly of course. Long story short, both parties get appropriately treated and safely transported to the hospital with the finger on ice. Tongs were used to fish the finger out of patient\u2019s mouth. I will explain later why this is very lucky. Ok class, what have we learned? Please do not stick your fingers into the mouth of someone in distress. \u201cBut they will swallow their tongue!\u201d No they won\u2019t. It is impossible to swallow your tongue while it is still attached. With that said, it is possible that your tongue may obstruct your airway if you\u2019re unconscious. That\u2019s why one of the first steps in CPR is the head tilt chin lift. This technique aligns the airway and forces the tongue to move up and out of the way.If you stick anything in the mouth of someone in distress, you run the very real risk of losing it. We had a similar call but instead of using a finger, this samaritan used a blue pen. When we arrived, the pen was gone but it was very obvious that it had been blue. Why? Because when the patient bit through the pen, enough blue ink came out to smear all over the patient\u2019s mouth. This samaritan turned a seizure patient into a choking patient. This patient thus required much more treatment than originally needed. EMT\u2019s have specialized airway tools that are used to secure the airway and keep it open. A pen is an inadequate tool for this. I am not speaking out against being a good samaritan and helping others in need. God forbid and knock on wood, if I ever needed help, I sincerely hope someone is there who is willing to do so. But there are two giant rules that one needs to keep in mind in these instances. Don\u2019t make yourself another patient. There was another good answer to this question by Zachary Smith which told us NOT to suck out the poison if your friend is bitten by a rattlesnake. You will make yourself a second patient. Scene safety is stressed extremely hard during training. If you go down while attempting to help someone, obviously it does more harm than good. The 2nd lesson is try not to make the patient worse. This may be easier said than done. I am just asking to think your actions through before committing to them, especially if you\u2019re untrained. Thanks for reading. Take care of each other. Edit: As of 8/25/2020, I am adding to this answer to discuss another misconception. It kinda sucks that Quora won\u2019t let me answer this question twice but I understand why. I hope it still gets views after this edit because this is a fun thing to discuss. Let\u2019s talk the American 911 system and what it\u2019s for. Please know that this answer is in no way trying to dissuade you from using 911 if you have an emergency. That\u2019s IF you have an actual emergency. If you read my previous answer to this question, you will know that I was an EMT for 5 years in Southern California, mostly in LA County and Orange County. During a shift, we get so many non-emergency calls. Honestly, I\u2019ll go so far as to say that only 1/3 of the calls we respond to were legitimate emergency calls and a proper use of the 911 system. The rest were calls that consisted of flu-like systems, tummy aches, general weakness, burnt tongues from hot soup or coffee, and other small scale occurrences. Flu-like systems was the most common 911 call. An old lady has had the flu for 2 days. But she\u2019s fully aware and mobile. She has no movement restrictions. So what a worried son do?\u2026 calls 911 so an ambulance can take mom to the hospital. He could have very well loaded old mom in one of the 3 cars parked in the driveway and taken her to the hospital himself with everyone wearing masks (regardless of covid). Instead, an ambulance crew shows up with the fire department. They conduct a quick assessment and the ambulance loads mom up and takes her to the hospital with the son following in his car. Many fire departments have an unofficial policy that requires the EMT\u2019s to transport the patient if we\u2019re called out. This most often happens when there is a language barrier between us and the patient and family. I don\u2019t mean for that sound disrespectful in any way, that\u2019s just the fact. Keep in mind, there is nothing I can do for a flu patient on the way besides show them my winning smile. So what are the underlying results of this non-emergency transport? Well the patient may or may not receive an expensive bill for the ride. This is never up to the EMT crew to decide. That\u2019s for the insurance company to sort out. But based on your specific coverage, your insurance may see the ride as a non-emergency and use it as an excuse to not pay. Then you are stuck with the bill. 1 of 2 things will happen to the crew. If the hospital is busy, and they generally are, the patient gets to wait on the wall with the patient sitting or lying on the VERY uncomfortable gurney. Gurneys are made for convenience to the crew, not for comfort of the patient. This wait can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 6 hours. 6 hours is my personal record anyway. This is more common than you might think. This is due to triage. As other patients come into the hospital with more serious conditions, they get seen first. As this crew waits for a bed for their patient, the other ambulance crews have to strategically move around to cover the area to the best of their abilities. There are a finite amount of ambulances in your neighborhood. If a call for a cardiac arrest goes out in that same neighborhood, the crew responding will have a longer response time because the regular crew is waiting at the hospital. The other option is the waiting room. Some hospitals are ok with us dropping non-emergency patients off in the waiting room. It\u2019s most commonly used for drunk patients and it pisses the patient off something tremendous. \u201cBut I was brought in by ambulance. So I should be seen NOW!\u201d Nope. That\u2019s not the way it works. You just potentially got a very uncomfortable $1,000 ride to the waiting room. I hope you enjoyed my company and winning smile. Here is the common misconception about first aid that has the potential to save lives: Just because you are transported by ambulance does NOT mean you will be seen any sooner at the hospital. Your method of transportation has no bearing on when you are seen. Your condition and the condition of other patients determines this. And if an ambulance crew is required to wait a lengthy time due to a non-emergency transport, it has the potential to negatively impact your neighborhood. This is food for thought. I empathize with how miserable one feels with the flu but if they are capable of receiving a normal ride to the hospital while taking the proper precautions, it\u2019s better for everyone involved. I use the flu as an example but it can be expanded to other situations as well.",

When a baby is born unexpectedly, at home or in a car, where no professional is in attendance, it\u2019s often assumed that the umbilical cord needs to be cut, and very quickly. In fictional, TV births of this kind, there\u2019s often a casual reference to someone grabbing scissors or whatever and immediately cutting the cord. This idea should be dispelled. First of all, it is dangerous to immediately cut the cord without first carefully and fully clamping or tying off the cord. Right after the birth, blood is still flowing freely through the cord. Cutting it at that point could result in heavy bleeding. The baby could die from loss of blood if it\u2019s not stopped quickly. Secondly, there is no particular reason to cut the cord at an unexpected birth. The cord can be left alone until someone is available to deal with it. If it is left alone, the infant\u2019s blood still in the cord and placenta will naturally return to the newborn\u2019s body (where it belongs), after which the placenta will normally detach and come out. More and more doctors (and most midwives) agree that it\u2019s better for mother and baby to delay cord cutting, and it\u2019s a common request at birth centres. No harm will result from leaving the cord alone, but cutting it immediately without the necessary precautions could be very dangerous."

Henry Mancini\u2019s score is also excellent; the lighthearted \u201cBaby Elephant Walk\u201d is what the film is best remembered for, but the opening theme is majestic and even menacing at times (much like Africa itself, no?). The plot of the film is ludicrous\u2014John Wayne plays hard-bitten American expatriate Sean Mercer, who heads a team of hunters and animal wranglers who run down and capture big game for stateside zoos. He falls in love with a svelte Italian photographer and the film turns into a schmaltzy romance. But I love it for the animal-catching sequences, of which, thankfully, there are many. No CGI here, folks. That\u2019s actually John Wayne sitting in a jumpseat on the front of a pickup truck, lassoing giraffes and wildebeest. I was obsessed with Africa from a young age, and this was the first non-animated film I ever remember classifying as \u201cmy favorite.\u201d And even today it\u2019s still one of my most reviewed films. My wife and I shared our first kiss while watching it. 9. Blade Runner (1982)Watching this film is almost exactly like reading one of my favorite sci-fi short stories. Hardly any other sci-fi film in existence gives me that feeling, except perhaps John Carpenter\u2019s The Thing. Besides being a juicy mash-up of science fiction and film noir tropes, Blade Runner has just about everything I love about cinema: a rock-solid premise, a sensible plot, characters with realistic motivations, breathtaking cinematography, jaw-dropping visuals, ethereal music, an intimidating villain, a hard-boiled protagonist, damn fine acting and writing (Rutger Hauer\u2019s \u201ctears in rain\u201d soliloquy, which he apparently wrote himself, will live forever), and even a tinge of romance. It simply can\u2019t be beaten for style or atmosphere. Bonus points for Deckard\u2019s blaster\u2014every sci-fi flick needs some cool-ass weaponry. 8. The Wages of Fear (1953)I mentioned something in the previous paragraph which I think is important for you to understand if you want to know why I like certain movies. That something is premise. I like movies that set up the plot in a way that I personally find intriguing. Blade Runner\u2019s premise, for example, is practically perfect in every way. In the future, humanity has created synthetic humans called replicants to do its dirty work. Due to some messy rebellions, replicants are now outlawed on Earth, but four of them have gone AWOL, stolen a spaceship, and made it to Earth, and they are now hiding among us. It\u2019s up to a badass retired police inspector to hunt them down. That is an awesome premise, in my opinion. And The Wages of Fear\u2019s is even better. A fire breaks out at a remote American oil well somewhere in South America. The only way to extinguish an oil fire is by robbing it of oxygen with a controlled explosion. The oil company offers to pay a ducal sum to any four individuals willing to drive two trucks laden with nitroglycerin\u2014which explodes at the drop of a hat\u2014hundreds of miles over bumpy-ass roads to the site of the fire. Four down-at-heel European expatriates (two Frenchmen, a German, and an Italian) volunteer for the suicide mission. What follows is two hours of the most oppressive, torturous, nail-biting tension I\u2019ve ever experienced while watching a movie. Seriously, this film will leave you a nervous wreck. I dare you to watch it. 7. Lawrence of Arabia (1962)One of the things that makes a film entertaining to watch is, of course, conflict. If there\u2019s no conflict, there\u2019s no drama, and no reason to watch the film in the first place. There are all types of conflict: man vs. nature, man vs. man, man vs. self. They all come into play in this film\u2014one guy\u2019s seemingly impossible quest to survive the harshness of the Arabian desert, unite the divided and treacherous Bedouin tribes and lead them in battle against the Ottomans, and come to grips with his divided loyalties and his own growing legend. Maurice Jarre\u2019s score and David Lean\u2019s cinematography, both of which can only be described with the overused adjective \u201cepic,\u201d combine with the transcendental acting talents of Peter O\u2019Toole and Omar Sharif to create an unforgettable classic. 6. Castle in the Sky (1986)I have a soft spot for this film for several reasons. First, it was released the year I was born. Second, aviation figures very highly in it. Third, a famous mythological city-state is integral to the plot. You guys know me. I\u2019m a history geek. I\u2019m a huge Indiana Jones fan. I\u2019ve played all the Uncharted games, too. I dig lost cities, man. So a story about a young boy building his own airplane to try to find the lost city of Laputa and clear his father\u2019s name is\u2026rather attractive to me. And again, we\u2019ve got some of my favorite cinematic joys here, too: romantic subtext, gorgeous visuals, and a beautiful score (par for the course for a Studio Ghibli film). How could I not love it? 5. The Warriors (1979)I told you before: I love a good premise. Cyrus, the head of the most powerful street gang in New York City (the Gramercy Riffs), calls a grand meeting of all the city\u2019s gangs in the Bronx. The Warriors, a small but proud gang from Coney Island (on the other side of town), dutifully attend. During the meeting, Cyrus is assassinated\u2014and the blame is pinned on the Warriors. Unarmed, outnumbered, and beset from all sides, the Warriors must battle their way back across the city, attacked by rival gangs at every turn. Great setup, right? It gets even better when you learn that this film is based on a novel which was based partly on Anabasis by Xenophon. Translated as \u201cUphill,\u201d Anabasis is a war memoir. Xenophon was part of an army of Greek mercenaries hired by Cyrus the Younger in the fifth century BC to help him steal the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes II. Artaxerxes\u2019s forces betrayed, killed, and/or captured all of the Greek generals, compelling the Greek army\u2019s junior commanders, including Xenophon, to march their men hundreds of miles back through enemy territory while being pursued and harried by Persian forces. If you want to see that same story set in New York City\u2019s dark underbelly in the late 1970s, watch The Warriors. 4. Mad Max 2 (1981)Marketed as The Road Warrior in the United States (where the first film had passed largely unnoticed), Mad Max 2 is a rare example of a sequel outshining the original. Not only does it expand on the themes explored in Mad Max and move the action at last into a lush and fully realized setting in keeping with the finest traditions of imaginative and original world-building, Mad Max 2 stands on its own two jackbooted feet as a masterpiece of post-apocalyptic storytelling. Its aesthetic is immediately recognizable and ubiquitous, often imitated but never quite duplicated. Writer and director George Miller singlehandedly created a subgenre of science fiction, invented an entirely new type of warfare (not land, sea, or air, but road warfare), breathed life into a novel type of antihero, and codified the Apunkalypse trope. Set-dressing aside, Mad Max 2 is a simpy a rollicking good time\u2014the proverbial tour de force, a swashbuckling action film par excellence, a testosterone-packed thrill ride from beginning to end. And it has the plot, characters, and dialog to back it up, what\u2019s more. The ending, though bleak, is immensely satisfying, and you can\u2019t help but root for Max and the ragtag group of survivors he winds up helping. The action\u2014obviously done the old-fashioned way, with live stuntmen and practical effects\u2014is utterly mind-blowing, even for the 1980s. A more perfect post-apocalyptic action film has yet to be made, and probably never will. 3. For a Few Dollars More (1965)Though often overshadowed by its more popular sequel, For a Few Dollars More is a sinfully good spaghetti Western in its own right. In much the same way that Meddle showcased Pink Floyd\u2019s transition from Syd Barrett\u2019s psychedelia to the soaring, instrumental-driven space rock that became the band\u2019s trademark, For a Few Dollars More brilliantly bridges the gap between the \u201cDollars\u201d trilogy\u2019s first installment (A Fistful of Dollars) and its third (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly). As in the latter film, the protagonist, the deuteragonist, and the antagonist are each given separate and riveting introductions, establishing their respective characters right up front. Anticipation builds unbearably as each member of the trio rushes toward the inevitable clash with one another, and builds again as the narrative inexorably reaches the final stage, the final arena, the final showdown. It\u2019s a formula Sergio Leone unashamedly rehashed in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but it works. And when paired with Ennio Morricone\u2019s impeccable score, Massimo Dallamano\u2019s tactile camera work, and the unimpeachable talents of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volont\u00e9, the result is something both captivating and timeless. 2. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)This film needs neither introduction nor synopsis. A two-fisted adventure tale par excellence, a love letter to the old comic-book heroes and pulp serials of yesteryear, an iconic entry in the canon of American filmmaking\u2026and most vitally, a damn good time in front of the screen. It was my favorite film as a teenager and well into my twenties, and still holds a special place in my heart. In trying to ape James Bond, Steven Spielberg crafted something both reassuringly familiar and at the same time refreshingly new\u2026and intoxicatingly fun, unlike half the franchises rolling off Hollywood\u2019s production line in the present day. 1. Yojimbo (1961)I may be alone in considering this historical drama, frequently eclipsed by Seven Samurai and Rashomon, to be the professional and artistic zenith of both its director Akira Kurosawa and its star Toshiro Mifune. But I sure as hell don\u2019t care. Everything about Yojimbo (\u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d) is fucking perfect, in my opinion. Kurosawa\u2019s immortal cinematography. Masaru Sato\u2019s sinister, subterranean score. Mifune\u2019s gruff, scruffy, squinting ronin Sanjuro, fit to out-Clint Clint Eastwood. The slimy, serpentine menace of Tatsuya Nakudai\u2019s gangster prince Unosuke. The black-and-white color palette. The sparse dialog. The low-fi sound. The timeless story. The clear-cut moral lessons. The absolutely goddamn perfect premise (lone badass rolls into town, observes two rival gangs terrorizing the populace, and decides to play both ends against the middle). The opening shot. The final showdown. The ultimate line of dialog. Everything. Maybe I\u2019m being subjective, or perhaps I\u2019m easily impressed by anything that even passes for cinematic brilliance in this artistically barren age, but I just adore this film. I think it\u2019s by far the best I\u2019ve ever seen (rivaled only by another Kurosawa entry, Ikiru).",

People kept asking why I was laughing too hard and my response was simple: \u201cbecause it\u2019s funny!\u201d The Shawshank RedemptionI know, it\u2019s on everyone\u2019s list. But it\u2019s just that good. The acting is superb and even after all these viewings it\u2019s still incredibly emotional. Roman HolidayTwo of the best (and best-looking) actors of the silver screen era with such perfect chemistry. And the ending\u2026 never what you want, but always satisfying. Sleeping BeautyI would call it the best looking animated movie of the \u201cgolden age\u201d of Disney. The sequence in the forest in the middle where Aurora first goes wandering alone with her forest creatures, and then meets the Prince holds up as stunning animation. And the music is excellent. I could list nearly every classic Disney movie on here (Pinocchio and Peter Pan for certain) but I\u2019m limiting it to this one, as even among standouts, it stands out. AladdinOf the Disney Renaissance movies, it may not be the best of the best (Beauty and the Beast gets that title for me) but it\u2019s probably the most easily rewatchable, with a great redemption story in the disguise of an even greater love story. Plus, Robin Williams The IncrediblesEvery time I watch this movie there\u2019s something else to love about it. I loved it as a kid for its quick wit and good action, and I love it as I\u2019m older for the strong themes, social commentary, and the way that it is just so much more than a superhero movie, it\u2019s a movie about life. (But it\u2019s a great superhero movie too). TangledOh wow the animation in this one. It always moves me. I would rewatch it for the Kingdom Dance scene alone. There are plenty more, I have a whole list of movies I can put on in the background, or when I\u2019m bored and doing nothing, and will still entertain me. These are the best of the best though.",

Many other similar baseless stories are circulating widely through internet. There are independent authentic study reports published by American Petroleum Institute, Australian Transport Safety Bureau and Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association all of them saying they could never find a cell phone ever causing a fire. They had chosen around 300 petrol pump fires happened worldwide, for their studies. And so this warning stands purely based on a myth! Almost all the reported petrol  station fires have been caused by static electricity (similar to what happens in clouds in thunderstorms).           Now a few words on the science of the matter. The risk which the petrol pumps are taking is that of a spark that can set off the petrol to fire and so to explosion. The minimum energy a spark should possess to ignite petrol vapor is around 0.2mJ. It is true that a fully charged mobile phone battery contains around 5 million times this energy. But the problem is, they are not designed to make sparks! If the internal circuitry is very faulty, lithium ion batteries can explode while charging . But we don't charge out phones in Petrol pump , right?.",

The Indonesian story alleged that a driver was burned when his car exploded at a gas station. No official reports ever surfaced. Warnings about the dangers of using cellular phones in the presence of gasoline fumes began circulating on the Internet in 1999. Though both  versions of the original Internet warning alluded to an accident in Indonesia wherein a driver was burned and his car badly damaged as a result of such an explosion, no reports ever surfaced in the news media to confirm the incident. Another alleged incident in 1999 was reported by oil companies to the South China Morning Post. This time the victim was an Australian man who was \"blown up\" when his phone rang as he was filling his car with gasoline. Fire service heads in Australia insist the incident never happened. Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and the American Petroleum Institute issued statements denying the risk. The CTIA issued the following:There is no evidence whatsoever that a wireless phone has ever caused ignition or explosion at a station anywhere in the world. Wireless phones don't cause gas stations to blow up. Warnings being posted in petrol stations simply perpetuate the myth.The American Petroleum Institute had this to say:We can find no evidence of someone using a cellphone causing any kind of accident, no matter how small, at a gas station anywhere in the world.In actuality, there is more risk for people who climb back into their vehicle while refueling. Static electricity is a real danger and it really can spark a fire.",
            "Not sure if it hurts the vehicle in a mechanical sense. They tell you not to run the engine while fueling because of electricity produced from the electronics on your car possibly sparking the gasoline fumes. At least that\u2019s what it says at the gas station by the pumps. I usually leave the ambulance I work in running while I refuel, but my personal vehicle I shut off when fueling. I\u2019d just do what the gas station says and turn it off when you fuel.",

I\u2019ve done exactly that in 110 degree heat\u2026 left the car running with the air conditioner on for others while I was pumping gas. Having said that, I normally turn off the engine, just to be safe.

It is the same principle This is a risk matrix for LNG pipelines but the principle is the same. \u200bThe potential consequence is catastrophic. Multiple fatalities, damages in the millions. (One could argue that the potential is for \"few\" fatalities). As to the likelihood, say for example one in a thousand cars generates a spark while running. Perhaps one time in a thousand times the fuel:air ratio is the correct proportion to ignite. You are looking at a million to one odds ie 0.0001% (hypothetical). This places us in the intermediate risk category. (or low if the potential is for \"few\" fatalities). Intermediate risk requires active management. Low risk would require a management plan. Now a million to one odds is a long shot. Not as long odds as the lottery but still unlikely. An average service station near a decently populated area with 10 pumps running constantly 18 hours a day is not unreasonable.Say on average 5 minutes to fill and leave. 216 fuel customers a day. 78840 customers a year.  There are 121000 service stations in the US alone. 9539640000 fuel customers nationwide per year.  9540 potentially catastrophic situations per year at a million to one odds. In short, from an individual perspective, the engine on or off is no big deal. The fuel industry on the other hand sees the opposite. A significant number of potential catastrophic events based on the volume of customers. And when the cost of minimising that risk is so small, there is no harm to the business in implementing it. NB figures are estimates, with the exception of the number of service stations in the US, which is US census data.  My estimate works out at approximately 64 fills per capita per annum. I believe it to be accurate.",
            "Some people argue that it's not safe due to fire hazard.Have any of them visited the United Arab Emirates? There it's not acceptable to TURN OFF your car while refuelling.And there's lots and lots of people refuelling every day. If there were any petrol station fires, I'm pretty sure they would enforce a rule to turn off your car.So there. We can theorize as much as we want, but there's a place on earth that's actual running that experiment and so far it seems that things are pretty safe. No risk management strategy required."
