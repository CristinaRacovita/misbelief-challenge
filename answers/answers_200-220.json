Somewhere around this time of your life your parents passed away.You were emotional, you digested the fact and moved on with your life. You married the girl and had a baby with her.But at this point of your life, you realized something, you are not aging anymore. To the point your wife got older and was at her deathbed but still you were in your peak years and had failed to grow old.Your wife died in front of your eyes and you were still in your peak years. The same thing happened with your son/daughter who died while you were still young. Same thing happened with your grandsons and great grandsons.One by one, each person you loved, each and every one whom you held dear to you died in front of your eyes but you did not reach your end.Years, decades, centuries passed and this emotional trauma kept repeating itself in a merciless manner. You caring for somebody and seeing death doing you part.Immortality. If there was one superpower that was worthy of being a curse more than the former was this. I understand, we dislike the idea of dying, but the thought of seeing my loved ones come and go for eternity while I just sit there, helplessly in my prime would be much more brutal than death itself. If there was one superpower that could make our lives a living hell, it is surely Immortality.",

Perhaps you decide to play around with it a little. You impress your friends with your ability to \u201cpredict the future\u201d by watching events and rewinding time to the moment just before they occurred. Fun things. Nothing too impressive or disruptive. Perhaps you use it to your advantage. Spending more nights studying for a particularly difficult test. Or, seeing the answers after the fact, and rewinding to before in order to amend any mistakes. Or maybe you just decide it\u2019s too dangerous, and you leave the ability alone. You adapt your life and abandon the talent, like a bird whose wings have been clipped. You might even forget that you ever had it.But eventually, the day comes. Perhaps something overwhelming regrettable occurs. Perhaps an accident happens. Perhaps you\u2019re laying on your deathbed, with only hours before you exhale your last breath.Desperate, you turn to all possible options. And as a last resort, you stare down this talent of yours. To reverse time to the beginning. To start over again. Not even the person with the greatest possible fortitude and willpower would turn down the opportunity. It couldn\u2019t be done, any more than somebody could refrain from their struggle for air, just as they were drowning. And so, you take in a deep breath, and begin anew.You open your eyes. It\u2019s not all lost. Some things appear unfamiliar, having escaped from your memory as time went on. It might all be a slightly different flavor, as the world around you has gradually changed. Items shift. The colors of your home\u2019s interior changed. But you adapt. And quite importantly, you remember the life from before.Things are rather odd at first, as you struggle to grow to live as your younger self while retaining the reality of your whole world that was. Some especially perceptive individuals might question exactly how somebody like you could so accurately predict future events. You quickly learn to play dumb to keep suspicions at bay. But you can\u2019t help that you\u2019re slowly growing to understand the landscape around you in a manner that no other ordinary person could hope to comprehend in one lifetime alone. You might take advantage of the head-start provided by the decades of knowledge you have stored.After a few lifetimes, you might start to get cocky. A not-so-accidental accident happens on your watch. Perhaps you do something terrible to somebody else, just to see how it happens in a consequence free world where everything can be reversed at a moments notice. If it\u2019s really bad, you might even let it happen time after time again. Just to partake in the gratuitous nature of it all. Just as a bystander can\u2019t help but stare at a train wreck happening. But even when everything\u2019s reversed, averted, or cleaned up somehow, the thought haunts you: what\u2019s to say that all of time should revolve around you in particular? What if, in those other timelines you reversed from, the problems you intentionally put into motion, no matter how bad they were, are left to remain for eternity? What if it was just your perspective that was wretched away from it all? Just as somebody might look away from a homeless person, begging for money, so as to pretend that they don\u2019t hold any responsibility for the problem. You fail to sleep peacefully for several nights.Time goes on. Many lifetimes pass. Each time, rather than facing death, you pull yourself from the grave, just as any person would instinctively. Knowledge accumulates. Different life choices are made, just to see how things would have played out otherwise. Regrettable moments are revoked on some occasions. Other times, they are reinforced; just because \u201cthings ended up better this way.\u201d Accidents and terrible things happen so often to close ones that it becomes a commonality. Occasionally, people point out to you how numb you appear to all of it. You quickly learn, after a couple of tries, how to keep up the facade of a caring person. But deep inside, it\u2019s not a strange exception to you anymore. It\u2019s just a regular occurrence. In a world where everything can be reversed and restarted, be it a mere few seconds ago, or all the way at the beginning of your existence, there are limits. You cannot change what was put into motion before you were born. You cannot glimpse what happens after you die. And while you can reverse any of your external consequences, your inner mentality remains unaffected.Any number of things can happen, given enough time. Perhaps you elect to use your accumulated knowledge to benefit mankind in ever increasing magnitude. Inadvertently, the key to your own longevity may be discovered, further compounding the impact. But you must inevitably ask yourself what its final impact would be. What\u2019s the ultimate meaning behind it all, if it can all be whisked away at a moments notice? Made to have never happened? What good are you doing, giving such bountiful gifts, if you\u2019re just taking them away again? Spending your lives towards destruction would be of equal moral consequence. To dedicate your talents towards harming others, to behold the specter of pain, sorrow, and death that you unleash upon then, would be of no lasting impact or meaning to you. Perhaps most horrifying of all: given enough lifetimes, you\u2019d inevitably find yourself playing the role of the monster. Not because you wanted to, necessarily. But just because you could. Just because you had to see what would happen. Just because you decided you needed that perspective.Humans weren\u2019t ever meant to experience what comes with an eternity. Such a long period of time is simply beyond the scope of our comprehension. The madness would inevitably settle in. Lost. Somewhere in the infinite array of timelines you\u2019ve experienced, with all the experiences that no human would ever have the ability to shoulder. To know, simultaneously, that you were the destroyer of worlds in some lives and a savior to mankind in others would be a harsh cognitive dissonance. The inevitable reckless moments would lead to guilt, and with it, a sense of paranoia over your lack of responsibility. What if I\u2019m not the only rewinder out there, and the time-police come to get me? If you were particularly unfortunate, you might spend several eons (from your perspective) going through the motions and replaying the same, dull life you\u2019d lived initially, without any significant variation, while remaining entirely mad and broken inside. If you were more fortunate, you might finally find a way to summon the willpower to confront death. Or, death might eventually find you. A death swift enough that there isn\u2019t anything you can do to avert it or rewind it in time. And just like that, it\u2019d be the end of you. No matter how it all eventually plays out, I believe that the power to rewind time and to relive your life would be a fascinating and wretched existence that I\u2019d wish upon absolutely nobody.",

(I promise I will keep this short) Day 1: Prologue Nice day outside! You are a little anxious about going to school, it\u2019s a test day! You hate history, math is your thing. Oh well, it\u2019s your day to shine! You pry into the well of knowledge of the teacher. Weird, he\u2019s thinking about her kids at pre-school, her twins had been quite the trouble-makers it seems. No problem, you think, let us peak into the mind of the best student in the class! There it is. The treasure box! You write everything she thinks, taking into consideration later corrections! You catch a glimpse of her life, she seems subtly distracted\u2026Family troubles? She\u2019s back to her knowledge-fetching mode, giving you time to write down, in your own words, everything she has earned for herself. Day 7: You got an A in the test. But you are not at school. You cannot go back there. When you thought people were being mean before, you were always consolling yourself. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think about me as much as I think they do\u201d you said to yourself. How wrong you were\u2026People say vile things in your face. They discuss abominations with their friends. But what people had inside their own private space of a mind, you couldn\u2019t even dream of in your worst anxietal existential despair. Day 14: Secluded. You cannot stand being in other people\u2019s minds anymore. The treasure box is filled with black tar. You have kept your hopes up for as long as you could. Resilient little creature! Step by step, though, you gave up. Every divination revealing the unexpected, always unpleasant and sub-par. You are tired. Your delusions were more integral to what society calls \u201chealthy functioning\u201d than what you thought. Everyone\u2019s delusions. The mind is its own biggest illusion-maker. Because it has to be! It has been forged to survive, and its best survival mechanism is pretending. This ability of yours has taken away your pretenses, and left you with a simple truth. Life is not worth living. Not here. Not with them. Day 21: Epilogue You have abused your power a little. You have started calling people on their bullshit, their bluffs. You predict fights, answers, you rock your interviews, sense any incentive, any roadblock. You can see the future! And it\u2019s as bleak as ever. And the people are worse. Oh the people, your biggest fear is spending time with anyone\u2026Even your own mother. She was the first to be de-pedestalized. You feel unloved, as your standards for love were all synthesized pre-telepathy. You do what you knew you could do since the beginning, but were afraid to. For the last time, you open the windows, reveal your chest-treasure from within your own mind. One little thought, amplified, and caught in a positive reinforcement loop. Madness. Utter, omnipotent madness. It was always there, lurking under the shadows. Oppressed by the big pre-frontal boss. The boss is gone, defeated. Insanity is the only sane mode of being. They find you comatose, a vegetable. Unfortunately for you, the next 10 years before your death are spent in a hospital bed. You cannot speak, or move your eyes. But you can listen. It\u2019s either that or nothing. And you keep listening. You cannot stop screaming, but you know that you cannot stop listening. So you keep listening and screaming and listening and screaming some more. Until even your mind is out of breath. \u2026There are worst horrors to be experienced with telepathy, this is but one scenario in a plethora of unbounded despairs.",

There is more. A lot of K pop idol had take their life because of depression. And this is happen because of too much burden on their shoulder. Some Idol lost their childhood because of being trainees. Some idols were getting hate before even debut. I would never believed when people said kpop idol was not depressed and perfect. They are tired. But they just can't show it. Because they don't want to worry their fan. And cause they know this world is cruel. So the answer is yes. They do depressed. We just didn't see it. But through all this challenge, they manage to become stronger. Depression is not crazy. They fight the darkness and create a path for them to keep going. So never judge a book by its cover.

Of all movies that get under my skin, I'd have to say there is one movie that will irritate me for the next 25 years. M. Night Shyamalan's Avatar the Last Airbender This movie was so far off the mark, audiences were leaving the theaters in groups. Shyamalan white washed the movie so terribly, he completely ignored the cultural differences that were so clearly defined in the animated series. Blue represents what tribe? Waterbenders. The Southern Water Tribe. How about red? Firebenders.Do we have any votes for green? Earthbenders. How do you mess that up? Movie Aang: He looked like someone's little psycho kid with something to prove. He hardly ever smiled. There was no real grasp on the relevance of the former airbenders. None of the sadness he endured by the loss of his people was addressed. I know that's someone's kid, but hey, I'm calling it as I see it. Kid? Don't play Aang. Ever. Animated Series Aang: He was a happy go lucky kid. He rarely became angry yet when he did, it was good stuff. If anyone remembers episodes 20, part one and part two, when General Zhao wanted to capture the moon, then you'll know what I'm talking about. Aang kicked some firebender ASS when he went into the Avatar state. That is one of my favorite episodes besides the one when Katara learned to bloodbend. And speaking of Katara... Movie Katara: The actress looked nothing like the people of the Southern Water Tribe. Nothing. She portrayed the character as timid, whiny and looked to *cough* Sokka for guidance. This wasn\u2019t how it went down in the cartoon. Everyone knows Sokka was the comedian of the group. He was not a leader. Authentic Katara: She was a born leader. When she learned to advance her waterbending skills, I literally cheered. Katara was brave, thoughtful and intelligent. She used her skills not only to help Aang, but other characters as well. Remember when she took on the role of the \u201cPowdered Lady?\u201d I have to mention the blood bending episode again. That was serious art. It took a keen execution of skill to be able to blood bend. Katara was FIERCE. Movie Sokka: How do I even begin with Jonathan, Jasper whatever the hell his name is? He should have stuck to Twilight as he clearly failed to give Sokka the credit he deserved. He was moody, reckless and did his share of whining as well. Repeat after me: There are NO vampires in Avatar the Last Airbender. Is it rocket science we don\u2019t see him in anything anymore? Authentic Sokka: HILARIOUS! Do you remember the episode where he drank water from a cactus and got high? LMFAOOOOOOO!!! Tell me that wasn\u2019t funny? Sokka cracked jokes and kept the team going with his genuine, light hearted personality. Sokka stepped to the plate when needed. He was no less brave than his sister. The relationship between he and Katara was very loving and supportive. It was so different from the cold, \u201cI\u2019m just working with him/her on the set\u201d mentality of the actors in the movie. This movie was TRASH. I won\u2019t go into Azula, Zukko and Iro. That will make me physically ill. When Iro fire bended on Zhao, I almost wished he was MY uncle. Iro was the GOAT! (Greatest of all time). The movie failed to touch on his grief over losing his son as well. Ok, I said I wasn\u2019t going to go there but I couldn\u2019t help it. And Shyamalan had the NERVE to get defensive? He should never be allowed to make another Avatar: TLA movie. Never! His fury paled in comparison to the fans' anger and disappointment. What about the lack of attention extended to the battle at Ba Sing Se in the series? Now that's a reason to be pissed. This movie let us down. All the way down. Avatar: TLA had such a huge fan base, there was no way we weren\u2019t going to pay attention to all of those Asian themes being totally ignored or those deplorable, watered down personalities of the characters. M. Night Shyamalan: Keep your hands OFF anything that has to do with this series.",

The Day the Clown Cried (1972).This film was written and directed by Jerry Lewis, who also served as the film\u2019s star. The plot centers around an over-the-hill German circus clown (Lewis) during WW2. Lewis is imprisoned in a concentration camp and tries to maintain his composure by preforming for the prison population. He doesn\u2019t have much success and is actually beaten up as a result. Later he finds some solace preforming for young jews imprisoned in the camp. Lewis\u2019 clown character is ordered not to entertain the jews, but he refuses the order. Ultimately, he is used by the Nazi\u2019s to lead the jewish children into the gas chambers at Auschwitz; Where overcome with remorse, he remains inside providing laughter for this children as they are slowly killed. This film was actually made, but never released. Lewis holds the only known copies and has vowed that they will never be seen. He is profoundly embarrassed that this film exists and that it is his name on it. For obvious reasons! A circus clown leading jews into a gas chamber?! The whole film was a tinderbox of scandal waiting to happen. The Day the Clown Cried is interesting not because of what a profoundly bad idea it was, but rather because I understand how it ended up being made in the first place. Lewis genuinely wanted this film to win him an Oscar, and I think it it easy to understand that. There is something very romantic about this idea of a circus clown, acting as a sort of \u2018guardian angel\u2019 to these children during their final horrific moments. It speaks to the innocence of youth in a way. On paper and in discussion I could understand how Lewis went into this picture thinking it would be a masterpiece. It wasn\u2019t. Very few people have seen this film, but the ones who have seem to agree that Lewis\u2019 particular brand of humor and slapstick was ill suited to this picture. Whatever gem of an idea was hidden deep within the script, Lewis killed it with this:I think that is pretty understandable. Mixing humor with the Holocaust could have been a very touching and memorable thing, it could have very well won someone an Oscar, but extreme care and subtlety were needed to accomplish it. Lewis just didn\u2019t have it."

I've even heard cats sometimes purring while they seem to be asleep, perhaps as part of a dream.  One of the dumbest things I have ever read about why cats purr was by a scientist who stated that cats purr not because they are happy but as a means of perpetuating the enjoyable thing being done to them.  That might be a secondary reason, but to say that it's not at all because they are happy is so much scientific hogwash, it is embarrassing.  I.e., I do not think cats purr while lying in the sun in order to keep the sun shining.  Cats purr primarily because they are happy or content. ",

They have limited means of communication, but they are actually pretty good at letting you know what they like and what they do not like.",

A few years back, our local dog licenses could only be obtained in-person at the pound. I hated going there, because I\u2019m at-capacity for pets and the sight of the animals I couldn\u2019t bring home tortured me. But it was necessary. So here I was in line, and there was an elderly lady in front of me with a cat carrier. She got to the desk, put the carrier up there, and told them that she wanted to be rid of the cat because it slept on her legs. As someone who treats pets as sort of ancillary children, hearing this felt like a slap in the face. I stood there shocked as she told them no, nothing was physically wrong with the cat, but she couldn\u2019t stand it sleeping on her legs and she wanted to be rid of it. The workers were reluctant, but they eventually took the carrier and the lady left. Still stunned, I went through the motions of getting my dog license and went home, but I couldn\u2019t get the image of that cat out of my mind. It was a little orange tabby with a snub nose and it looked slightly bewildered as the workers checked it over. I\u2019d had an impulse to shout out that I would take it, and I was so sorry I hadn\u2019t. I called all over, trying to find someone who could take this cat. I wanted to go right back to the shelter, say that I would take it home, and hold it and apologize to it for having to live with that woman. I wanted to get it set up with a loving new owner and sunny windowsills and all the damned legs it could sleep on. Finally, my vet\u2019s office volunteered to shelter it until it could be adopted out. Thrilled, I called the pound and told them the good news, asked when I could come back for the cat. The puzzled worker told me that the cat had been euthanized a few minutes after the lady surrendered it. While I was getting my dog license, that cat was dying because some selfish old woman didn\u2019t like it trying to be close to her. And that\u2019s the story of how I cried so hard I vomited, for about a week straight, and how I learned that some people are really garbage, and many other things that mainly involved self-scorn over my stupid marshmallow heart. I shake when I think of it even now. I should have grabbed that cat and run out the door with it. I tell you that to tell you this: you hear a lot about, and are probably prepared for, that stereotypical standoffishness of cats. How a dog will jump and slobber all over you, but a cat will glare at you from under the bed for days on end. Mostly, that\u2019s a myth. Cats love, too, but how they show it can be very different from how a dog shows it. My cat Pepper, a torbie,has been with us since she was a tiny kitten. Her whole life has been one of security and contentment. For the first seven years, she had her adopted brother Sammy to protect her; they\u2019d come home from the shelter together. Pepper\u2019s favorite time of day is when she can get me cornered in my bed or reclined in a chair. She gets as close as she can to my face and snuggles in, purring away. If she can actually lie down on my hair, so much the better. She will remain like this for as long as I\u2019ll let her. Sometimes she manages to touch her cold nose to my cheek, and she holds it there for as long as she can. If I am accessible, she is on me. Like this.This is the happiest she ever gets, but it\u2019s extremely uncomfortable for me. Having a tubby housecat weighing down my head is definitely not the best thing for my already-fragile spine. Also, I\u2019m allergic to cats. I love them, but their dander and saliva do terrible things to me. Claritin is only so effective when you have the cat actually trying to sit on your head, you know? My eyes puff up and I\u2019ve lost many a contact lens from watering and swelling. But would I get rid of Pepper for showing me how much she loves me? Never. My other cat, Comrade, is a Russian Blue. She was owned by a nearby family who, I think, bought her to breed. But for whatever reason, they started starving and abusing her. She was turned out in all weather, skin and bones, and was responsible for litter after litter of gray kittens whose descendants still roam the neighborhood today. I witnessed neighborhood kids swinging her by the tail and flinging her as far as they could. I found the guts to scare them off. When the family abandoned her for good and I found her curled outside my front door under a skiff of snow, she became ours permanently. Here she is shortly before we took her in:Comrade\u2019s love is a complicated product of trauma and relief. She winds herself ceaselessly around my ankles, even when there\u2019s ample food and water and all the attention she could want. She can\u2019t get out of the begging loop. Her neediness is exhausting. I trip over her many times a day. She cuddles up next to me and tries to nurse on my arm, my shoulder, sometimes my face. If I am in a stationary position, she will be there kneading on me. But she\u2019s also unstable, so if I move she thinks I\u2019m about to attack and retaliates accordingly. A lovey session can turn into a battle in seconds. I can handle it, because I know how messed-up and terrible her life was before she came to us. If I need some space, she has a designated safe place where she can hang out for a while. She always bounds right back in, ready for more. When people acquire a cat, they are prepared for the aloofness. It might be what leads them to want a cat in the first place\u2026the idea of an intelligent animal who mostly self-maintains and isn\u2019t totally dependent on their human is appealing. But that\u2019s only part of a cat\u2019s personality. They will love you, they will be thankful to be with you, and they will show it. How happy your experience with them is depends on how well you can read that and react to it. You need to be able to recognize what it is they\u2019re doing, or else it will read as a long chain of behaviors custom-designed to drive you insane. Their need to show love is sometimes very insistent and it won\u2019t always be a good time for you to be loved-on. They will want to be close to you and encroach upon your space in all kinds of annoying ways. They will strive to have you within their sight at all times, but they will also do their best to appear completely cool about it. Your clothes will be sat upon. Your keyboard will be sat upon. You will receive unwelcome dead things as gifts. Sometimes unwelcome not-quite-dead things. You will be annoyed, grossed-out, aggravated. But they adore you, and they don\u2019t speak Human, so this is the best they can come up with. The lady whose ill-fated cat slept on her legs completely misread it, and therein lies the tragedy. If you take in a cat, make sure you can handle the love it wants to show you.",

Sometimes, if I stare just right and lick my lips, Dan will get the little pounce treats out and feed me a few - I like them. Sometimes, I feel like my human is not paying enough attention to me, so I sit and stare until he does. Of course, sometimes I just like to look at him. If I want to be sneaky about it and watch what he\u2019s doing, I close my eyes to slits and watch him. But the biggest reason I stare at my human is because I am a cat and I do what I want to do. Sometimes I just want to stare. Sometimes I stare at the wall or at the ceiling for no reason at all, and I am thinking, planning, cat stuff. Now, don\u2019t anyone tell Dan I was using his computer.

It would of course have been wildly different from the existing Return of the Jedi (including the title). I would probably have introduced Jabba in some form, since he had been named and foreshadowed in the two previous films, and Boba Fett was going to bring carbon-frozen Han to Jabba. But \u201cmy\u201d Jabba would inevitably have been totally different from the one we know, since the two first movies had offered no hint about his species (remember that he was only retroactively inserted into A New Hope, and I assume that the prequels don\u2019t yet exist in this scenario, either). Perhaps \u201cmy\u201d Jabba would simply be a human crimelord. I guess I would also have Han still in carbonite, and some kind of rescue mission in Jabba\u2019s lair ensues. But all the details would be quite different, though I would probably also have killed off Boba Fett and regretted it later. In the entire film, \u201cmy\u201d Luke would likely be more vulnerable than the rather stoic near-Jedi the third movie gives us, much more like the devastated young man we have at the end of Empire. I would never have made Luke and Leia siblings (the fans would be up in arms, pointing out that they had kissed in the previous movies \u2014 obviously making them brother and sister is NOT what good old now-deceased George Lucas intended!) So how to resolve Yoda\u2019s \u201cthere is another\u201d line from Empire? If I do come up with the \u201cVader redemption\u201d story line, we can say that Yoda in his wisdom realized that Anakin is the very last hope of the galaxy, and that he rather than Luke is the one who is destined to overthrow the Emperor. If so, we are back to the storyline where the fate of the galaxy depends on whether Luke can reawaken Anakin Skywalker inside Vader and make him thow off the Sith persona. Anakin is the \u201cother\u201d. Or would I have felt that \u201cVader redeems himself\u201d is an overly sentimental story-line? Might I even have introduced the notion that Vader isn\u2019t Luke\u2019s father and just lied to him, screwing with his head? If so, Vader would remain a villain to the end, finally perishing in an epic fight with Luke. (But his body isn\u2019t found, so that we can bring him back if we decide to make more movies!) I probably would not have introduced a second Death Star (because all the fans would go, \u201cCome on, you have NO originality, you are just imitating George\u2019s plot here! HE would have come up with something new and exciting instead, since he was a creative person and you clearly aren\u2019t!\u201d) If I am asked to improve upon the plot of the Return of the Jedi we do have, but keep the basic structure, I would make the following changes: Instead of Endor we have Coruscant (or whatever we want to call the \u201cImperial Center\u201d planet). The opening crawl could inform us that the Rebellion is now spreading even to the capital world, and the Emperor is beginning to feel the heat. He has withdrawn to a gargantuan structure that is being constructed in orbit around the planet, maybe say something pyramidal in shape; we may call it the Palatial Pyramid. The Rebels believe the Emperor is weak and plan the ultimate attack on his capital world, intending to blow up the Palatial Pyramid, and him with it. As in the existing movie, it is protected by an energy shield generated from the world below, and a stealth team must land and take out the shield generator before the entire Rebel fleet jumps in. But in this version, there is no boring Ewok-infested forest world; our heroes go to a dark, polluted sci-fi city instead. As demonstrated by Blade Runner, even with Harrison Ford in it, the FX of the early eighties could have delivered a perfectly sastifactory vision of the sinister Imperial Center city. Luke surrenders and is brought by Vader to the orbiting Palatial Pyramid, facing Palpatine very much as in the movie we have. When the Rebel fleet arrive, we have the big twist: The Pyramid is a Death Star, just with another shape, and with its enormous cannon somehow hidden until Palpatine gives the order to start vaporizing the Rebel fleet. He has been building a new secret superweapon in plain sight of the entire galaxy, feigning \u201cweakness\u201d, but actually luring the Rebels in to be utterly overwhelmed and destroyed. Moreover, he plans to blow up the rebellious capital world below as soon as the Rebel fleet has been destroyed, so that the protective shield is no longer needed. Luke therefore faces both the total destruction of the rebellion and the certain death of Han and Leia on the world below, along with billions of other sentients. From then on we have pretty much the same plot, but with more emphasis on what a hopeless struggle the Rebel fleet faces; we see their ships going down like flies, totally overwhelmed by the enormous firepower of the newly-revealed Second Death Star. Luke\u2019s hatred gets the better of him and he attacks Palpatine only to be stopped by Vader; father and son then fight, as in the movie we have. How to improve the scenes on the world below? Han and Leia must still infiltrate some kind of facility and plant a bomb to blow up the shield generator. Maybe they successfully make it in and back out, but then there is shocking development when they are somehow unable to set off the bomb. Perhaps they are pursued and lose the trigger mechanism, or it somehow falls just beyond their reach. If we still maintain that Leia has recently been revealed as Luke\u2019s sister, this gives us the opportunity to actually do something sensible with this plot point instead of just throwing it in to little purpose: In the moment of utmost despair, when all seems lost, Leia saves the day by unlocking her Force ability, telekinetically triggering the bomb and blowing up the facility with the shield generator. (One problem with the existing movie is plainly that Leia has rather too little to do in the last half.) The Death Star is now open to attack, and Lando leads the pitiful remains of the Rebel fleet against it, much as in the movie we have. This attack should closely parallel the climax of the Luke-Vader-Palpatine situation, when Luke ultimately refuses to kill Vader and goes \u201cI\u2019m a Jedi, like my father before me\u201d on an enraged Palpatine. As before, Vader finally discovers that he is unable to let the Emperor kill his incorruptible son. The instant Palpatine goes down the shaft, it is obvious that the Empire has lost, so as little time as possible must transpire between that moment and the destruction of the Death Star. We might have a somewhat slower \u201cexplosive wave\u201d than in the movie we have, with extra tension as to whether Luke and the redeemed Anakin can make it off the Death Star in time. Replace the \u201cVader unmasked\u201d scene with Imperial officers struggling to carry out Palpatine\u2019s last order and blow up the world below, even as the Death Star is falling apart around them. Of course, it explodes in the last split-second before they could get the lethal ray away. This explosion should be different, say nuclear-like with an intense white light; in the existing movie it feels quite anticlimatic, just another boring and rather plain explosion after countless others. After a moment of tension it becomes clear that Luke did make it off the Death Star in time, and in my version a dying-but-still-living Anakin is with him on the shuttle. He lands in the city (thrown into chaos as far as the demoralized Imperial forces are concerned), and Leia quickly comes to the ship. It is now, with both of Anakin\u2019s children present, that Vader\u2019s mask is removed and Anakin gets to see both of his children \u2018with his own eyes\u2019 before he expires. Maybe I would not have shown Anakin\u2019s face very clearly, just suggesting that he is burnt and disfigured (say, a few extreme close-ups: a little smile on his lips, his eyes before they close). Luke and Leia get to see him; we the audience don\u2019t need to. His exact appearance is a bit of private information, not crucial to us and rather detrimental to the Vader mystique (as long as he was Vader, the mask for all intents and purposes was his face). In this way we also maintain maximum freedom to cast anyone as Anakin if we are making the prequels later, with no potential continuity errors. (Hello, Hayden!) Luke and Leia both attend their father\u2019s funeral fire. Then a new day dawns on the Imperial city; the freedom fighters are now in full control, and we celebrate the downfall of the Empire (without any pesky \u201cyub-yub\u201d Ewoks in this version). Perhaps we should have a glimpse from Han and Leia\u2019s wedding. The three Force Ghosts are probably a must, but again, we may leave Anakin\u2019s face obscure. Da End. Yeah. That\u2019s how I would do it.",

It\u2019s the fine details that I would change up. The Jabba plot arc is what I would change the least. I would give Boba Fett a more epic part, maybe even having him escape, but that\u2019s hindsight talking. George Lucas had perfectly valid reasons for Fett\u2019s limited part and early death. Fett was tied to the bit with Jabba and it made sense to end his arc with Jabba, plus George underestimated Fett\u2019s popularity. Most of the changes would come after Han\u2019s rescue.Interdictor cruisers should be part of the Imperial fleet, since its purpose is to keep the rebels from escaping. Of course, they didn\u2019t exist when RotJ was written but now that they do, there\u2019s no reason not to use them.Ewoks would become Wookiees. That was actually what they were in the original script for \u201cThe Star Wars\u201d which eventually became A New Hope. Lucas was really wedded to the idea of indigenous aliens helping the rebels destroy the Death Star, which I think is why he recycled the Death Star into RotJ. However, he felt that Chewbacca had been displayed as too tech-savvy for a primitive race, so he cut the Wookiees in half and made them Ewoks (remember that next time you\u2019re wondering how teddy bears are beating up stormtroopers). I would have just considered Chewie to be an exceptional member of his race who learned his technical skills from his extended time spent with Han. Most of his people would still be very primitive.We could even keep the whole getting captured and almost eaten part of the film simply by making this a different tribe than Chewie\u2019s (and potentially even a rival tribe).I would come up with something different than a new Death Star. Again, that seems to be George just trying to return to his original Star Wars script. One version would be using a variant of the Sun Crusher from the EU:This version of the Sun Crusher would be massive. It wouldn\u2019t need to be another Death Star but maybe something the size of the Executor. The size would be partially just for it to be able to function as a warship in its own right but also the torpedoes it fires would be pretty large themselves.For those who aren\u2019t EU fans, the way the Sun Crusher works is it fires a torpedo into a star. That torpedo triggers a reaction that causes the star to go supernova, which destroys the planets in that system.To keep more or less with the general flow from RotJ, these torpedoes can also take out capital ships.Inspired by a deleted RotJ scene where Palpatine orders the Death Star to destroy Endor, when the shield generator is destroyed, the Sun Crusher fires a shot into the sun. The reaction will take time but the events are now set in motion. No matter what the outcome of the battle, the forest moon will be destroyed.This leads to a scene where Wookiees, surviving Imperials, and Rebels are all piling into shuttles with each other to escape.It explains why the Imperial fleet doesn\u2019t just crush the rebels following the destruction of this superweapon. Both fleets will be scrambling to get away before they are consumed by the exploding star.The Sun Crusher doesn\u2019t get destroyed by a secret weakness or even having its power core still exposed by virtue of being under construction. Instead, rebel ships disable its engines, leaving it stuck to be destroyed by a supernova that it created in the first place.Another idea is that instead of another superweapon it could be a shipyard constructing more super star destroyers.A cool lead-in would be a scene at the shipyards on Mon Calamari. We see Imperial Star Destroyers being overwhelmed by an unexpectedly large fleet of Mon Cal capital ships. Then the Executor drops in Rogue One style and decimates the rebel fleet.Cut to the mission briefing. The rebels have intelligence that there is a secret shipyard constructing an entire fleet of super star destroyers. Once completed, one will be sent to every sector across the galaxy, making it extremely hard for the rebels to gain any ground militarily. However, none of the ships are operational and the shipyard itself (being a construction site and not a military facility) is extremely vulnerable to attack. Its only defense is a shield generated from a bunker on Kashyyyk.Naturally, the Emperor himself is arriving to review this new fleet of warships.This also kind of makes more sense than a superweapon. Each one of these ships is a terrifying and nearly unstoppable weapon in its own right but a fleet of these can be built for the cost of a single Death Star.When the rebels arrive, the Emperor\u2019s new flagship\u2014the Eclipse (no superlaser)\u2014is already completed and opens fire on the rebel ships.At the end of the battle, shuttles filled with rebels and Wookiees board a few of the other ships under construction. We see a few with operational engines being used as suicide vessels to ram other ships, notably the Executor and Eclipse. We also see one or two with operational weapons used to run off the Imperial fleet (which should otherwise still be capable of crushing the rebels).At the end, I wouldn\u2019t just have a big celebration. There would be celebrating on Endor/Kashyyyk. On other worlds, oppressed people see this victory as a signal to rise up. Instead of giant parades, we see:Riots between pro-rebel and pro-Imperial citizensA statue of Palpatine being torn down despite shots raining down into the crowd.Stormtroopers being overwhelmed by an angry mob.Captured star destroyers moving into orbit over liberated worlds.Finally, I would do something with Leia\u2019s story. We\u2019re told that she\u2019s the backup plan if Luke fails, that she can be every bit as powerful as Luke, but then nothing happens. It feels tacked on. Maybe there is a way to handle this differently.One simple option would be that during the critical moment where Luke goes on the offensive, Leia feels his anger and distress just like she did at Cloud City. When Luke is ready to deliver the killing blow to Vader and cross that line, it\u2019s Leia that reaches out through the force to stop him. This could also be an opportunity for character development for Leia. She would have to reconcile her hatred for Vader with her love for Luke and the consequences of Luke killing Vader.We could have Obi-Wan or Yoda appear to Leia during the fight on Endor/Kashyyyk to help her the same way Obi-Wan helped Luke during the Battle of Yavin. She suddenly develops some relatively minor force ability that she uses in a way to swing the battle in their favor. Maybe she ends up pulling a mind trick to get them back into the bunker to place the charges.Maybe Leia sees a force vision of Luke turning to the dark side. Realizing the danger he\u2019s in, she also turns herself in and they end up facing Vader and Palpatine together. At the end, the Emperor starts zapping Luke with force lightning (because as the trained Jedi, Luke is the real threat). Leia lacks the power to stop it but she ends up being the one redeeming Vader and convincing him to turn against his master. Like my first idea, this offers a chance to have some character development. The dialogue throughout the encounter will touch upon her hatred of Vader and the rage and fear the mere sight of him raises inside of her. At the end, she has to reconcile those emotions and forgive him in order for him to finally see that he can indeed be redeemed in the eyes of his children.Regardless of all of this, the end of this arc is largely the same. Vader turns on Palpatine only to die shortly after that.If Leia is with Luke, their escape might even feature her trying to help an injured Luke and Vader to the shuttle. Leia ends up piloting the shuttle and gets aided by Anakin\u2019s force ghost.Another option here is that we get rid of the Leia as Luke\u2019s brother story. This can set up the love triangle Lucas originally envisioned. Han dies a noble death on Kashyyyk, Leia and Luke fall in love. At the end, the \u201cother\u201d Yoda referred to (which in ESB did not appear to be someone Obi-Wan was aware of) actually ends up being Vader himself. Yoda sensed the conflict inside of Vader but just didn\u2019t want to bank on it.",

Here are some pros and cons of climate skepticism: Pros:Encourages critical thinking: Skepticism can be healthy when it motivates people to ask questions and seek evidence to support their beliefs. Climate skeptics may challenge the scientific consensus and motivate researchers to provide even more robust evidence to support their claims.Skepticism helps avoid groupthink: Skepticism can prevent groupthink, which can occur when a group of people agree with each other without critically evaluating their beliefs. Climate skepticism can encourage people to evaluate the scientific evidence themselves rather than blindly accepting the consensus.Skepticism can lead to alternative solutions: Some climate skeptics argue that the scientific consensus on climate change is overstated or wrong. This skepticism can motivate researchers and policymakers to explore alternative solutions to climate change, such as geoengineering, which involves manipulating the Earth's climate to counteract global warming.Cons:Can delay action: Climate skeptics can delay action on climate change by questioning the scientific evidence and downplaying the urgency of the issue. Delaying action can make it more difficult and expensive to address climate change in the future.Misinformation: Climate skepticism can spread misinformation about climate change, which can be harmful. Misinformation can lead to confusion and inaction, making it more difficult to address climate change.Hinders progress: Climate skepticism can slow progress on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to clean energy. Without widespread recognition of the need for action, governments and businesses may be less likely to invest in renewable energy and other climate solutions.Overall, while some level of skepticism can be healthy in evaluating any scientific claims, it's important to be aware of the potential downsides of climate skepticism, particularly when it comes to delaying action and spreading misinformation. It's important to rely on credible, evidence-based sources when evaluating scientific claims, and to recognize the urgency of addressing climate change.",
            "Many people dismiss all claims of climate change because the exaggerators have said so many things that are not true.

When you learn that the polar bears are not dying from receding ice, that Kilimanjaro is not melting because of global warming, that hurricanes are not increasing in number, that neither are tornadoes, that malaria is not spreading from the heat -- it is tempting to throw out everything. When you were told back in 1999 that the recent surge in temperature was our last warning (we now know it was a short burst due to El Nino), and that if we didn't act in the next 5 years it would be forever too late -- and then you learn that here in 2015 it still isn't too late -- you are tempted to think the whole thing is nonsense.  The problem is that scientists have become advocates and they have been spinning the data, to emphasize only the data that shows impending disaster, and not the data that counters it. In other words, too many scientists have been acting like politicians and lawyers, and as a result, much of the public has lost faith in scientists.  I feel that the proper role of scientists is to present the data clearly, fairly, and objectively.  Warming in the past 50 years has been less than 1 C, and that knowledge might cause some in the public to dismiss the danger. Scientists need to acknowledge that it has been small, but that expected increases in carbon dioxide emissions are about to accelerate the warming, and that the threat lies in the future. We have to trust the public and the politicians to understand what we say. When we exaggerate, we have a temporary effect (as did the movie \"An Inconvenient Truth\"), but when they discover that we scientists have been exaggerating, it is difficult to win back their trust.

The green revolution saves money, keeps people fit and healthy, and encourages small business development. As I already said, such places are also much prettier. I see a need for cars, but I argue against total dependence. Young people and the less fortunate should be able to engage the world without car expenses. Cars are a must in the USA because it is bigger than in Europe, which I find absurd. My analogy would be buying pants too big and arguing that you must put on weight, so they fit better. The USA shows health and financial problems of many kinds. What are the top ideas for cutting back? There are none. We now have a highly vulnerable society. Many or most families live on the edge. Speaking of right now, credit card debt is reaching all-time highs. There is a steady rise in colon cancer among younger Americans: Colorectal Cancer Rising among Young Adults. Our life expectancy is ranked in the \u201940s. It is time to look closely at how we live in the USA, and many possible changes overlap with climate mitigation. When the Mayor of Paris sets the goal of a 15-minute city, she is thinking about reducing car dependence. Thinking of the bigger picture, lacking scientific breakthroughs, we can increase investment in transit, nuclear and alternative power sources. Otherwise, we need to change how we live. Those are all good ideas, regardless of climate change concerns. For example, cheaper power is a good thing.",

Let\u2019s separate actual skepticism from \u2018skepticism\u2019 first. Actual skepticism is what scientists engaged in research apply constantly. They are always testing hypotheses, doubting data and validating sources stringently so that they stand on the shoulders of giants, not gelatinous midgets. There is an enormous amount of productive skepticism under way every minute of every day in scientific efforts related to climate research and solutions. On that note, I spend a considerable amount of time understanding climate solutions, assessing them from a systems engineering and probability of success lens. I\u2019m skeptical of a lot of proposed climate solutions and publish and speak on that regularly. That\u2019s productive skepticism. I\u2019m not debating that climate change is real, serious, caused by us and that we have solutions, I\u2019m skeptical about many of the solutions being hyped by the fossil fuel industry, and skeptical about individual solutions being hyped by advocates, for sometimes overlapping reasons. But the \u2018skepticism\u2019 you are referring to is about climate change being real, being serious and being caused by us, or combinations of those three attributes. The previous answers to the question had \u2018skeptics\u2019 covering the continuum of denial.I drew this continuum over five years ago, and it remains useful (and someone pointed out that my vertical axis label makes little sense, so that catches on my eye like a piece of grit every time I grab it from one of my published articles and reuse it). You\u2019ll note that the word \u2018skeptic\u2019 does not appear on this diagram. That\u2019s because \u2018skeptics\u2019 are just deniers under a pleasant euphemism. I would recommend just using the correct term instead of conflating productive skepticism with climate change denial. Deniers want to be called skeptics so that they can pretend that they are part of productive conversations, but that\u2019s not what they are. So why are \u2018skeptics\u2019 in denial? What has caused them to suffer this cognitive failure to accept empirical reality? There are multiple reasons, and I\u2019ve published a bunch on this too, and spent a bunch of time with cognitive scientists such as John Cook and Stephen Lewandowsky exploring the mentality, reading their research, collaborating with them and in John\u2019s case, podcasting with him. John Cook, by the way, is the leading light behind Skeptical Science, the premier climate disinformation debunking site on the internet. Well worth bookmarking. His PhD thesis was based on the assumption that you could reach deniers and change their minds. Subsequently, he\u2019s relocated to the USA and done a bunch more research, and realized that it\u2019s almost impossible to reach deniers. He, and others in the field, had underestimated the tremendous power of tribalism to shape our view of reality. And that\u2019s a primary argument for why there are still climate change deniers. They belong to tribes where climate change denial is part and parcel of the tribal values, and so they internalize it and defend it vociferously. They aren\u2019t actually defending the irrational and untenable position that climate change isn\u2019t real, isn\u2019t serious or isn\u2019t caused by us, they are defending their tribes. And to be clear, this is complete subconscious. These people are as self-reflective as Vantablack, the least reflective substance in the world until recently. They have no clue that all of the energy that they are expending rationalizing, compartmentalizing, cherry picking, minimizing, conflating and misrepresenting is all in aid of some tribe that they belong to. They think that they are great thinkers. The Dunning Kruger reeks off of them (and likely other things, but I try not to get close enough to actually smell these people). White supremacists are tribally climate change deniers now, both in North America and Europe. It\u2019s an article of faith for them. Libertarians are tribally climate change deniers now. One of the more prominent ones, Jarry Taylor, formerly of Cato and now running the right-wing Niskanen Center, has formally stated that they no longer call themselves libertarian because now there is a dogmatic values test of climate change denial in the tribe. The Republican Party made itself explicitly the tribe of climate change denial, starting in the 1990s. That\u2019s why Bush yanked the USA out of the Kyoto Protocol, Trump yanked the USA out of the Paris Agreement, and why climate change denial across the spectrum above is so much more common in the Republican Party. That\u2019s crumbling now, as there are no Red states not seeing climate change impacts regularly now, often severe. But they remain on the spectrum, as they minimize human causation. Part of the evidence of crumbling and minimization comes from the new Republican Conservative Climate Caucus. Their primary belief \u2014 and they explicitly frame it as a belief \u2014 is the following:\u201cThe climate is changing, and decades of a global industrial era that has brought prosperity to the world has also contributed to that change.\u201dSo yeah. Acceptance that the climate is changing, but no acceptance that the climate is changing incredibly rapidly away from what natural climate change would be doing, which would have been a very slow cooling over the next 50,000 years, and that humans are responsible for 100% of the warming and 100% of the (very minor) avoided cooling. The industrial era and prosperity is indicative too. This is back to the solutions part of the problem. Their solutions are almost entirely fossil fuel oriented, in other words, not solutions at all, just perpetuation of the problem. You can read my full assessment here if you want.New Republican-Only Conservative Climate Caucus Light On Science, Heavily Pro-Fossil FuelsNew Republican Climate Caucus policies: Point fingers at others. Give money to fossil fuel industry. Pretend US is a leader, as opposed to a laggard.https://cleantechnica.com/2021/07/13/new-republican-only-conservative-climate-caucus-light-on-science-heavily-pro-fossil-fuels/So the Republican tribal lock on complete denial is cracking, but as my continuum shows, that just means that they have moved a step or two along a path to reality. Republicans aren\u2019t there yet as a tribe, so tribal members continue to be \u2018skeptical\u2019. There\u2019s a big tribe of evangelical protestants, mostly white, in the USA that have challenges with this too. They have been swept into the Republicans starting with Nixon\u2019s explicitly racist Southern Strategy in the 1960s, and cemented with Reagan\u2019s same sex marriage to the Moral Majority in the 1980s. 52% of flat earthers are \u2018very religious\u2019 in the USA. These are almost entirely Young Earth Creationists who think the fossil record was created during the six days of God\u2019s labors less than 7,000 years ago. Only their god can change the climate in their limited minds.It\u2019s worth looking briefly at someone who has managed to move the needle for at least several tribally locked deniers, Katharine Hayhoe. She has all of the necessary attributes to get through to one of the tribes, specifically evangelical Christians. It\u2019s not a short list. First, she\u2019s part of their tribe. She\u2019s an evangelical Christian. That allows her to bridge to deniers based on common values and tribal signifiers. Second, she\u2019s an actual and recognized authority. She\u2019s a PhD. She co-publishes massive reports on climate like the US National Climate Assessment. She runs a climate center at a Texas University. Third, she actually knows what she is talking about and can communicate it simply. She can deal with every objection that comes up. Fourth, she\u2019s willing to spend the time doing retail changing of minds. She engages with small groups of evangelicals regularly, spending the first 10\u201320 minutes of the hour on common values, and then the remainder making it clear that evangelical values don\u2019t preclude acceptance of climate reality. She engages with them personally. I don\u2019t have those attributes, especially the willingness to do retail correction of tribally instilled ignorance and bias. That\u2019s not how I add value. But good for Katharine, and also good for her much less successful wholesale efforts, and very good for her for her excellent work in climate research. She\u2019s one of the greats.So there you go. The arguments for climate change \u2018skepticism\u2019 are cognitively almost entirely due to tribal affiliation. When the tribal leadership changes, then the tribe changes, typically with little conscious understanding that they changed. The Republican Conservative Climate Caucus is indicative of a sea change there, and while it\u2019s baby steps, a lot of Republicans will suddenly be asserting that yes the climate is changing and we should do something about it. It\u2019s a long way from an acceptance of the reality of the situation so that we can start from the same facts, and hence arrive at useful solutions, but it\u2019s movement."

In short it's a triangular area in vicinity of Bermuda hence called Bermuda triangle.The Bermuda Triangle has long been believed to be the site where a number of mysterious plane and boat incidents have occurred.While it has become part of popular culture to link the Bermuda Triangle to paranormal activity, most investigations indicate bad weather and human error are the more likely culprits.Research has suggested that many original reports of strange incidents in the Bermuda Triangle were exaggerated and that the actual number of incidents in the area is similar to that of other parts of the ocean.While its reputation may scare some people, the Bermuda Triangle is actually part of a regularly sailed shipping lane with cruise ships and other boats also frequently sailing through the area.Aircraft are also common in the Bermuda Triangle with both private and commercial planes commonly flying through the air space.Stories of unexplained disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle started to reach public awareness around 1950 and have been consistently reported since then.Unverified supernatural explanations for Bermuda Triangle incidents have included references to UFO\u2019s and even the mythical lost continent of Atlantis.Other explanations have included magnetic anomalies, pirates, deliberate sinkings, hurricanes, gas deposits, rough weather, huge waves and human error.Some famous reported incidents involving the Bermuda Triangle include:The USS Cyclops and its crew of 309 that went missing after leaving Barbados in 1918.The TBM Avenger bombers that went missing in 1945 during a training flight over the Atlantic.A Douglas DC-3 aircraft containing 32 people that went missing in 1958, no trace of the aircraft was ever found.A yacht was found in 1955 that had survived three hurricanes but was missing all its crew.Secret behind it: some say it is the place where there is some kind of concentration of earths magnetic or gravitational pull or such kind of concentration of some unknown natural powers. Though the truth is no one knows what it's secret it. That's why it's a mystery.",

            "As others have pointed out, the simple answer is no. It's worth looking at where the Bermuda Triangle myth started, which was with an article in The Miami Herald in 1950.

One of the two PBM Mariner seaplanes dispatched to search for Flight 19 also disappeared.The Star Tiger: a BSAA Avro Tudor IV plane that disappeared without trace on 30 January 1948.The Star Ariel: another BSAA Avro Tudor IV Continue ReadingAs others have pointed out, the simple answer is no. It's worth looking at where the Bermuda Triangle myth started, which was with an article in The Miami Herald in 1950. It was based on three 'mysterious' aircraft disappearances in recent years:'Flight 19': the designation of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle on December 5, 1945. One of the two PBM Mariner seaplanes dispatched to search for Flight 19 also disappeared.The Star Tiger: a BSAA Avro Tudor IV plane that disappeared without trace on 30 January 1948.The Star Ariel: another BSAA Avro Tudor IV plane that also disappeared without trace on 17 January 1949.When looked at carefully, there's actually nothing mysterious about any of these three disappearances, but they gave rise to the enduring story of the Bermuda Triangle and its supposed dangers for shipping and aircraft. Flight 19 remained in radio contact with their base in Florida for some time (over two and a half hours) after the flight leader's plane suffered an apparent compass failure. He seems to have unwittingly led his flight out to sea after mistaking the islands of the Bahamas for the Florida Keys, with the result that all five planes ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. The exact position where they ditched was unknown, and no wreckage or bodies were ever found. The PBM Mariner seaplane looking for them seems to have suffered an explosion. It did not, in fact, disappear without trace. A tanker in the area saw flames and unsuccessfully searched for survivors through a patch of oil where the plane apparently went down. It's a human trait to think there must be reasons for things, or links between them - isn't it unbelievable that these five planes disappear, and then one of the search planes also disappears? - but the fact is that the loss of the search plane was simply an unhappy coincidence. Aviation in the 1940s was a lot less safe than it is now, and incidents were sadly much more frequent. The other two high-profile aircraft disappearances of the time - the Star Tiger and Star Ariel - were both the same type of aircraft, operated by the same airline, BSAA, whose safety record was appalling. They'd had 11 serious accidents in three years and lost five planes (with 73 passengers and 22 crew members killed). These two particular aircraft disappearances were the subject of a BBC investigation in 2009 (Bermuda Triangle plane mystery 'solved') and there appears to be nothing mysterious about them. \"The Avro Tudor IV was a converted warplane that was eventually taken out of passenger service because of its poor safety record,\" the BBC notes. BSAA was the only commercial airline still operating them. And it has to be borne in mind that \"commercial flights from London to Bermuda were new and perilous [in the late 1940s]. It  would require a refuelling stop on the Azores before the 2,000-mile  flight to Bermuda, which at that time was the longest non-stop  commercial overseas flight in the world.\" If the BBC's hypothesis is correct, one of the planes simply ran out of fuel because it was flying into a headwind at low altitude due to poor weather. (The other is likely to have fallen victim to a design problem in the cabin heater.) These days, there are statutory 'safety margins' in terms of the amount of fuel carried by planes. Any commercial flight bound for Bermuda today would have enough fuel on board to divert to Florida if need be, 700 miles away. That wasn't the case in the 1940s. These were dangerous planes at the best of times, operating at the absolute limit of their range. In short, the three 'mysterious' incidents that gave rise to the idea of the Bermuda Triangle turn out to be ... well, not mysterious at all. But we all love mysteries (I remember first reading about the Bermuda Triangle as a teenager, over 30 years ago, and being captivated by it, which was fuelled by Spielberg's inclusion of Flight 19 in the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind) and of course something like this caught people's imaginations, so much that a whole genre was spawned after that original 1950 article that sold innumerable newspapers, books and magazines over the decades. It appears, however, that the Bermuda Triangle is (statistically speaking) no more dangerous to ships and aircraft than would be expected. Sure, it's sad when a captivating mystery turns out to be no mystery at all, but the fact is that any of these kinds of 'mysteries' are almost bound to have some mundane explanation or another.",

Jokingly, (and without thinking first) I said \u201dit always seems to happen right as we pass through the center of the Bermuda Triangle\u201d (which was about where we were). I slapped the PA mic back down on the hook and continued discussing something irrelevant with the first officer. Not a care in the world. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Some of the passengers were horrified and they let the flight attendants know. The next thing I heard was a chime from the cabin with both the fwd and aft galleys in a conference call letting me know in no uncertain terms that they didn\u2019t need any additional hassle tonight. Was I just trying to make their lives miserable? Did they ask me to help them identify the crazies among the passengers? They said they couldn\u2019t hear for all the GD passenger assistance chimes. As the folks were deplaning, I stood in the cockpit door saying goodbye and thank you and I got several negative comments asking why I didn\u2019t go to Florida and then turn north or other advice on my choices in life. About two weeks later, I was forwarded two letters from passengers accusing me of malfeasance for navigating through a known treacherous area. The chief pilot put a sticky note on one of them that said I should probably not mention the scary and crash infested Bermuda Triangle anymore. It had a smiley face next to it.

A more likely reason it didn\u2019t happen was simply that the band\u2019s days were numbered. They were just putting the finishing touches on the Abbey Road album, the last thing that they would record together, and they all knew that the long and winding road was coming to an end. And of course the Beatles had ceased touring some three years earlier. The internal tensions that led to the band\u2019s demise were still very much simmering, and the band would split just months later. Still, it\u2019s fun to speculate on what might have happened had they agreed to play. Certainly the Beatles would have been the headliner, and since rain delays had pushed everything back, they wouldn\u2019t have played until Monday. By the time headliner Jimi Hendrix took the stage, it was 9:00 Monday morning, and only about 40,000 people remained, the rest having had enough of the mud and squalor. However, had the Beatles been scheduled to headline, it\u2019s safe to assume the bulk of the crowd would have stuck it out until the end, and perhaps an even bigger crowd would have showed up to begin with. Any conjecture about what songs they might have played is, of course, pure speculation. We\u2019ll never really know, but based on the well-documented setlists from their hundreds of live performances from 1960 -66, there are some things we do know that give us clues as to what a Woodstock setlist might have looked like. Beatles shows were short - less than 30 minutes and featuring usually 11 songs. Had they been the headliner at Woodstock, it\u2019s safe to say they would have played a much longer set, certainly over an hour. George and Ringo always got to do a song, so we can assume that would have been the case. With a longer set, they might have even gotten two. A look at their setlists over the years also offers another clue: The band never really overhauled their setlists. They evolved gradually, as they added newer tunes and dropped older ones. For example, by 1965, She Loves You and I Want to Hold Your Hand had been dropped and I Feel Fine and Help added. By the time they finished touring in 1966, Paperback Writer, Nowhere Man, Day Tripper and Yesterday had replaced Help, We Can Work It Out and Act Naturally. So let\u2019s assume they would have stuck to more recent material, with maybe an oldie like I Saw Her Standing There or Roll Over Beethoven thrown in just for fun. Abbey Road was all but completed, and my guess is they would have probably featured at least a couple of tunes from it, probably Here Comes the Sun for a George song (He did perform the song at his shows) and Come Together (I can hear John now introducing it - \u201cWe have a new album coming out. It should be in the stores by the time the last of you make it out of here\u2026\u201d). Also, the legendary rooftop performance featured in the movie Let It Be was in January of 1969, with the album being released after the band\u2019s breakup. It\u2019s seems likely some of that material would have been included, with friend Billy Preston probably joining the band on keyboards. Get Back seems like a safe bet. Since the White Album would have been their latest album at the time, having been released on November 22nd of 1968, and being that it was a double album, it stands to reason that much of that material would have been played. Back in the USSR and Helter Skelter would have been slam dunks, although with the Charles Manson murders happening just a week earlier and the gory details still very much fresh in the news, they might have avoided the latter. Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band would have been a logical opener, segueing naturally into With a Little Help From My Friends (\u201cHalf a million of you!\u201d). There\u2019s just one problem with this scenario: John\u2019s ego. Would he have been okay with not only Paul but Ringo singing a tune before he got his turn at the mic? Probably not. So maybe a John tune first then SP/WALHFMF. Given the occasion, Revolution seems like it would have been a good bet for the opener. I envision an acoustic set with Paul doing Yesterday, George singing Here Comes the Sun and maybe John doing Julia. A second George song might have been While My Guitar Gently Weeps. Lady Madonna, Magical Mystery Tour, and possibly Yellow Submarine (with a rousing crowd sing-along) as a second Ringo song are logical assumptions. Having seen Paul McCartney from the fifth row, I can tell you that seeing him perform Hey Jude live, with 20,000 people swaying, holding up lighters and singing their hearts out is one of the most magical, unforgettable concert experiences ever. Imagine the same scene with a multitude of 500,000 or so. For an encore, why not invite Jimi, Janis and whoever else was still around to join the band onstage for a sing along of All You Need is Love? What an incredible finale what would have been. The Beatles playing Woodstock would have been a brilliant, historic, fitting coda to their history-making careers. Would the experience have inspired them to put aside their differences and carry on? To quote the Verve\u2019s Richard Ashcroft from the song by the same name, lord I guess I\u2019ll never know.",

So if he found out The Beatles were in town and would be the final performance, he very well would have refused to participate. Secondly, the dynamics at Woodstock would have been thrown absolutely, completely out of balance. So many bands would naturally feel so overshadowed by the greatest rock band ever it would cause unbelievable headaches & chaos. Can you imagine everyone from the practically unknown groups up to super groups like The Who being regarded as \u201csecond-rate\u201d? What would be like for groups who would be giving it all they have, only to hear chants of \u201cWe want The Beatles!!\u201d throughout their performance? (To think of what it would be like for \u201cSha-Na-Na\u201d, who would have come on right before them \u2026 hundreds of thousands of people all yelling for them to shut up, pull the plug, and get off the stage! Utter humiliation.) Most if not practically every performer or band would be seething with resentment, feeling like their music was being dismissed or ignored as the fans all were chomping at the bit for \u201cthe band everybody came to see\u201d. That was 100% against the spirit of what the founders of Woodstock wanted to create. This was anything but a \u201cbattle of the bands\u201d venue \u2026 they desired an atmosphere of equality where every performer, no matter how obscure or unorthodox, was appreciated for the unique \u201cfood\u201d they brought to the table. Speaking of resentment, The Beatles themselves were not on the best of terms in the summer of 1969. It would have been awkward at best to perform live together. And they all mutually agreed to stop giving concerts in 1966. How much trouble would it take to overcome all this? And what about compensation? To make an offer that The Beatles would have settled for, there would be no alternative but to cut the salaries of every other performer. Yes, I\u2019m sure that would have gone over beautifully \u2026.. In addition to all this, there were the practical matters. The stage was hurriedly constructed at the last minute (since there was a last-minute change in venue, they had to work continuously & all through the night just to get the basic stage in place). So it wouldn\u2019t have met the technological needs of the band to perform the more elaborate songs that characterized their later music. Stripped down to their basic instruments, these songs would have been cheapened. There was nothing at the Festival that resembled a security force, so what assurance did The Beatles have that they would be protected from their frenzied fans? And as we all have seen from their live performances, the fans would have been screaming at decibels louder than a jet engine. It would have drowned out their music and no one (not even the group) would hear anything. Even if they did perform, they would have little incentive to produce a quality performance. It would have probably been a lousy show anyway! So in summary \u2026 even if The Beatles did perform, no one would have been happy. For a Festival such as this, the strange but accurate conclusion is that Woodstock was better off without them.",

They would have certainly performed songs from Let it Be which was recorded in 1969 (although released the following year) and they would have definitely provided some songs off the yet to be released Abbey Road (released September 26, 1969; Woodstock was in August of that same year.)

They would have certainly performed songs from Let it Be which was recorded in 1969 (although released the following year) and they would have definitely provided some songs off the yet to be released Abbey Road (released September 26, 1969; Woodstock was in August of that same year.)

For one, most of Sgt. Pepper\u2019s would not have been played. The same applies to Magical Mystery Tour. 80% of the tracks on both of those albums were overtly produced in the studio that to convert them into a live performance, especially one at an outdoor venue in which the technology and soundboard was greatly limited, would have been extremely challenging. But the acoustical songs would have worked. So too would the straight forward rockers. If I had to take my uneducated but fun guess against a 1 hour slot (The Beatles would have gotten a much greater duration) it would be the following:Come Together (Intro song\u2014and appropriate)RevolutionBlack BirdHelter SkelterWhile My Guitar Gently WeepsHey JudeLovely RitaI\u2019ve Got a FeelingTwo of UsWe Can Work it OutI am The WalrusHere Comes The Sun (Last Song)Let it Be (Encore)",

After this, Lennon\u2019s career as a Beatle is 99% over.Sept. \u201869: In Sept., the group holds a meeting on the 8th to ostensibly plot the way forward\u2014proposing to Paul that each member get 4 songs each (Ringo 1\u20132) or else as a condition of continuing. Paul resisted such a regimented format\u2026Jim Cushman wrote a great answer about this a few years ago here: When was the last time all four Beatles were together?Lennon performed at the Toronto \u201cPeace Festival\u201d on Sept. 13, and told those around him that he was leaving the Beatles. Then, somewhat incongruously, Lennon, McCartney, and Starr all signed a new royalty agreement with their record company circa Sept. 20. Harrison was absent. Lennon tells the others he\u2019s decided to quit. They ask him to keep quiet about it. He did. 1970 In Jan. \u201970, Ringo, Paul and George record the Harrison tune I Me Mine for Let It Be. It\u2019s the last complete Beatles song recorded. Although each of these 3 would do the odd overdub for the album in the spring, Lennon was never active musically with The Beatles after Aug. 20, \u201869. (FYI: Pointedly, when Let it Be was being prepped in spring \u201870, there was no group photo shoot for it\u2026the images used for the cover were stills from the film/photos taken over a year earlier.) No real chance of a live performance Even if the calendar had been more friendly, it\u2019s worth remembering the Beatles hadn\u2019t played before a crowd in 3 years. The \u2018rooftop concert\u2019 held in Jan. \u201969 was for a handful of wives/engineers/close friends. So it\u2019s unlikely that the band would have jumped at the chance to get onstage before 500,000 people. Rooftop show almost called off: Even this 42-minute show for their closest friends almost didn\u2019t happen. The band went upstairs to the roof b/c they couldn\u2019t agree on a more formal location to play or even IF to play at all. When the day came, they were on the verge of backing out until Lennon said basically, \u201cOh, what the hell. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d And like the old days, his childhood pals followed his lead. Struggling in \u201869: They didn\u2019t complete the Get Back project, didn\u2019t like the album that came from it, and shelved it. It\u2019s kind of a miracle that Abbey Rd exists. And, even though people love it\u2014look closer, more than half of the album is a collection of unfinished song fragments\u2026very creative to sew them together\u2026but it also suggests that the group were using up all of their bits in an effort to reach the finish line. Which happened to be a few weeks short of Woodstock, at best. This isn\u2019t to say that The Beatles weren\u2019t capable of still recording great music or performing. When they got together, they made great stuff. The problem was they were disagreeing more outside the studio which reduced their willingness to do musical things together. So, the Beatles didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t have played Woodstock. By the time of the festival, they really existed in name only. Woodstock organizers might have had more luck asking John and the Plastic Ono Band to play\u2026but that\u2019s another answer for another question. My answer makes me a bit sad\u2026but they wouldn\u2019t have played."
