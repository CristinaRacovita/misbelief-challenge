            "The hardest I have ever cried is the day I found out my brother killed himself. Nov. 4, 2011 I had spoken with him on the phone. He wanted to hang out but I had told him I was busy with my 2 yo daughter and couldn't. Nothing seemed particularly wrong. Nov. 5, 2011 I get a call from my dad at work to call my brother because he'd not been able to reach him. At this point he was living with my dad and his new wife. I call and don't get an answer either. I really didn't think much of it, I figured he was probably just drunk and asleep.

Nov. 4, 2011 I had spoken with him on the phone. He wanted to hang out but I had told him I was busy with my 2 yo daughter and couldn't. Nothing seemed particularly wrong. Nov. 5, 2011 I get a call from my dad at work to call my brother because he'd not been able to reach him. At this point he was living with my dad and his new wife. I call and don't get an answer either. I really didn't think much of it, I figured he was probably just drunk and asleep. He became a heavy drunk, smoked weed, snorted anything that could be snorted, basically any drug he could find, shy of injectables. He wasn't a bad person, he was just badly hurt. He had knocked a girl up and insisted on marrying her; first mistake. They were married for about 3 years and his son was 2 \u00bd when things started going really wrong in their relationship and decided to separate, thus, him living with our dad. Fast forward a couple months after leaving he's checking the mail and received something from his soon-to-be ex; paternity test. Odd, my brother never took a paternity test. He opened it and finds another guy's name and he can't be excluded as the father by a 99.999% chance. His son was not his son. Nevertheless, he wanted to retain fatherly duties like child-support, seeing him regularly, etc. The mother did not want that and completely removed the child from my brother's life. He was never quite the same after this. Took anything to numb the pain. He went on like this for a couple years until Nov. 5, 2011 when he'd felt abandoned by everyone, devastated by the loss of his child, because it was still his child in his eyes.. My dad knew something was wrong so he called the police to check the house out. He didn't want to walk in on my brother's lifeless body. Cops enter the house, find my brother, dead in the garage. Carbon monoxide poisoning. He had shut himself in and cranked his car up, drank himself to sleep and never woke up. My dad called me about 8:30 that night and when I answered his voice was shaky and tearful and he told me Michael was gone.. I was in the garage having a cigarette with my wife when I heard. My body gave out and I slinked from the couch to the garage floor absolutely howling, unable to move. My wife was trying to pick me up and through sobs I told her to just leave me there. I must have been on the floor for 30 minutes just bawling, mind racing, feeling so much guilt over not being there for him the previous day.. I still had to call my mother who was here in Kuwait to tell her her baby boy was gone. It was the middle of the night for her so when she picked up, obviously still half asleep I told her Michael was gone. She said gone where? I replied, gone mom. Frustrated she again says gone where?? Finally I just had to say, mom, he's dead. He killed himself. She was on the next flight back to SC.. We buried him on Nov. 10. I can still see my mother wailing over his lifeless body in his casket. I had written my brother a letter, telling him how good a man he was, how good a father, a brother and friend. I wrote that I loved him forever and would miss him. I slipped the note under his suit jacket, right on his left breast, kissed his forehead and said my goodbye. That was the most awful, heart-wrenching thing I have ever had to endure. Here's me holding him in 1984.Him around 1985\u20131986.Him, my dad and I.Being silly. He was a character.Image of what went on his headstone.Sorry for the long answer but thank you all for reading. EDIT: I found a couple more pictures today. This is Michael with his son:He and I hanging in the garage, collaborating on some music. We played a lot together.Thank you all once again for all the views. It's astonishing to me. I'm so happy to be a part of this community.",

So, this is the time of our life, when we have no idea what is really happening with us. It's all spontaneous. I was one of the most notorious kind of student. Most of the time, teachers kept me standing out of the class, as punishment. My only work was to fight with other kid, bully them, snatch their lunch etc. You know, the worst kind. Always busy with my boys. I used to hate girls, don't know why! So, let me describe Kendriya Vidyalaya a bit. Basically, it's a school for the children of military personnel\u200b. So in every 3 years, new kids join the school ,because in military there is a transfer in every 3 years. When I was in standard 4th, a new girl joined the school, her name was Gauri Krishna, she was from kerala. I didn't notice her in the beginning, but as time passed, she tried to be more friendly with me. I don't know why. She once gave her homework\u200b to me and faced my punishment. But these things didn't affect me. I was still a rude, harsh, disrespectful and ungrateful person. One day, we decided to play kabbaddi.Boys vs girls. We were losing badly to girls. I was the last person standing from my team. Gauri came, I dodged but somehow she managed to touch me, if I would have let her go my team would have lost. My ego didn't allow it. So I pushed her, she fell on iron wiring, both of her hands got cut, it was bleeding like hell. I got scared and ran away. For many days, she didn't come to school, but then also I felt normal, I guess I was a cold-hearted bastard. Finally, she came to school, I was hiding from her. Both of her hands were covered in bandages. During lunch she came to me and the next thing she said to me literally made me cry. She said \u201cAre you alright?\u201d. I ran away. Slowly we became friends. From then on, her fights used to be my fights, her pain was my pain. It was the beginning of something magical and divine. I had fallen for her and I think she loved me too. We were like inseparable souls. Then came standard 7 summer holidays. Though we both hated this time, as we have to part ways for this period. Summer got over, but she was no where to be found. Days went by, but no sign of her. Months passed. I used to go to school in hope that one day she will hit me from behind, and say \u201cMissed me duffer?\u201d. But, it did not happen. One day I mustered enough courage and went to her home. I asked her mom, \u201cAunty, Gauri isn't coming to school. Has she not returned from her grandmother's home yet?\u201d. Her mother first kept quiet and then started sobbing. I was clueless, then she told me that Gauri died in an accident. I became numb. My mind stopped working, I could feel teardrops falling from my eyes. I started running and ran till my lungs pained. Till this day I wait for her to hit my back and ask \u201cmissed me duffer\u201d. Yes, I missed you. Yes, I miss you.If we are meeting for the first time - Sunny Kumar !",

            "In 2009, I was 26 years old and had a 4 year old son, and 2 year old and 1 year old little girls. My son had been sick for weeks. I'd taken him to the pediatrician every week for 4 weeks, and taken him to the ER once when he collapsed in pain and was screaming and begging me to make it stop. I was told repeatedly he had an upper respiratory, and the pain was just because he was constipated too. When he collapsed a second time, I took him back to the ER again and told them I wasn't leaving until they figured out what was happening.

My son had been sick for weeks. I'd taken him to the pediatrician every week for 4 weeks, and taken him to the ER once when he collapsed in pain and was screaming and begging me to make it stop. I was told repeatedly he had an upper respiratory, and the pain was just because he was constipated too. When he collapsed a second time, I took him back to the ER again and told them I wasn't leaving until they figured out what was happening. This time we had a different doctor, and as soon as she did her initial assessment, I could see on her face that she was concerned. She immediately got the doctor supervising the ER that day to come check him out as well, and I saw them making eye contact with each other throughout, and I knew they were very worried, although they didn't tell us what they suspected yet. They ordered bloodwork, and only an hour or so after entering the ER, they both came back and had someone come take my son to another room to color while we spoke. They asked me to sit down, and as soon as they started talking about his blood counts I started to feel like I was gonna faint. When they actually said the word \u201cleukemia\u201d, I started screaming and sobbing. I had forced my husband to come (he thought I was being paranoid and the previous doctors were right and it was just a virus), and I remember gripping his shirt as I screamed and wept. I had no experience with cancer, and as far as I knew, my 4 year old little boy could be facing a death sentence. I had always seen the St Jude ads, and listened to the stories on the annual telethon on the radio, and used to cry hearing the parents talk about losing their children. I remember pulling over and praying that my children never be that sick as I cried for those kids. My baby going through that was my worst fear, and it was suddenly coming true. I cried a lot during his treatment (never in front of him), but that first evening was shattering for me. And a side note: Cancer is NOT a death sentence, that was just what my inexperience and fear told me at the time. My precious little boy is now a healthy 12 year old who's about to pass my height. He had a difficult 3 years, but he is now healthy and cancer free.",

I let it go for a while, pushing my feelings away, continuing with our day. A little while later, my two rascals decided they wanted to play a pretend game. One of them would come to get me and say that the other was asleep. I had to come and wake him up. When I came, they pretended to be fast asleep, and I had to tickle and kiss them to wake them up. There was a lot of laughter and screaming involved, of course. I found it cute and hilarious, and decided to take a photo. I took my phone and snapped a few shots.  Only after taking these shots I realized what my heart knew since the first moment I saw my son today. He reminded me of another little boy. A boy who can\u2019t pretend to be asleep ever again. A little boy who cannot be awoken with tickles and kisses. This little boy.My heart broke. I had to leave the room, because tears started streaming down my face. I\u2019d carried this little Syrian boy in my heart since the first time I saw the photo of his tragedy. Today I got to see him in my boy, and I knew that all children, everywhere, are just the same, and deserve to be awoken from their pretend sleep with tickles and kisses, warm, safe and loved.

She got married two years back and left to her in-law\u2019s place which is 5-6 km from our house. We (my daughter and I) employed a new domestic help. Sunita\u2019s mother Venkamma(name changed) is a washer woman and irons our clothes. Within one year after marriage Sunita delivered a baby girl. She was happy seeing the baby. She had many dreams about her daughter. \u201cI will make her study until degree. I will not let her stop studies after 8th standard like me\u201d she would say. Within three months after her first baby was born, she became pregnant again. In fact she was not even aware that she was pregnant. She thought it was normal for not having periods for six months.(She was not breast feeding due to some problem). When she felt first movement of baby, she went to the doctor and the doctor confirmed that she was six months pregnant. \u201cAmmagaru(madam), I am tensed with my daughter\u2019s pregnancy\u201d Venkamma said to me when she came to collect the clothes. \u201cWhy are you tensed?. Previous delivery was without any complications. You need not worry\u201d I said. \u201cNo, I am not worried about delivery or the expenses associated with that. But what if she delivers a girl again?\u201d Hearing this I got angry. \u201cYou have three daughters. Are you not happy? Never say this again to me\u201d \u201cNo Ammagaru I don\u2019t have any complaints about my daughters. In fact I am happy. All my three girls work and earn their money. But Sunita\u2019s in-law\u2019s were not happy with her first child being a girl. I don\u2019t know what they say if she delivers a girl again\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t speak these stupid words in front of Sunita. Rather try to give her moral support, telling that whatever the baby may be you are there to support her\u201d. \u201cAmmagaru I just wanted to vent out my anxiety before you. But I never say such things to my daughter\u201d \u201cGood\u201d I said. One week after this conversation, Venkamma came to collect clothes again. Her face showed that she was still tensed. \u201cYou seem to be still tensed. Why?\u201d I asked. \u201cAmmagaru what if she inherits my genes and delivers a girl again\u201d She did not actually use the word \u2018genes\u2019. (Naa polika vchchi malla aadapilla pudutundemo in Telugu\u2014which roughly translates to \u2018she may take after me and have a female child again\u2019) \u201cSee Venkamma, even if she inherits your genes it is her husband\u2019s chromosomes which decide the sex of a baby\u201d. She did not understand what I said. I explained to her in as simple language as possible but could not convince her. But Sunita was never worried. \u201cAmmagaru, even though I wish for a baby boy for change, I won\u2019t feel sad even if it is a girl\u201d she said with bright eyes brimming with happiness. Yesterday while my daughter and I were chatting, we remembered that her delivery date was due past 4-5 days. Daughter immediately called her on phone to ask whether delivery was over or not. All she could hear from the other side was Sunita crying loudly. In between the sobs she said she delivered a baby girl five days back. Because of her sobs, and lot of disturbance in the phone, daughter could not hear what she was telling. Daughter hung the phone after telling her not to cry. She decided to go to Sunita\u2019s house today. But today morning we heard shocking news from one of her neighbours. She had delivered a healthy baby girl five days back. She was even able to breast feed her baby unlike the first one. She was happy seeing her healthy baby. Her in-laws insisted that she should come to their house from the hospital, not to her mother\u2019s house. She agreed. But from the moment she came home from the hospital, her in-laws and husband started to abuse her continuously, accusing her that she delivered a girl even second time. \u201cYou inherited your mother\u2019s genes (they did not actually use the word genes). You will never produce a son in future\u201d they yelled at her. She quietly took all the yelling, seeing her healthy girl. But yesterday was very unfortunate day for her. She breast fed her baby and went to wash room to have a shower. The baby was peacefully sleeping before she went to wash room. By the time she returned from wash room, she saw that the baby\u2019s body had turned black! She rushed to the nearest doctor and they declared that the baby was already dead. From the time I heard this news, I could not control my tears. What might be the plight of that poor girl(Sunita), facing all this trauma? Can people be so brutal to kill a small cute baby? When will people realise that a woman is not responsible for the gender of the baby? \u201cYou are too naive. People do these things. Not only in movies, this happens in real life too\u201d husband says. How I wish that my suspicion becomes false! Edit: There were lot of comments yesterday but I couldn\u2019t reply because I was feeling upset and sad. The question many people asked is \u201cdid they report to police?\u201d No They did not report. The parents themselves did not want to report, because that would spoil their daughter\u2019s married life. We were helpless.",

On the other hand if we sleep with our head towards the North which would repel the North of the human body i.e. the head of a human being, we would feel more exhausted and less energetic because of this repulsion.Hope it helps you and if you liked it.Follow me onQuora Jivesh Kashyap Ig _shekhu",

But even if you don\u2019t accept any of these portraits as legitimate images of Katharine, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual. There is only one undisputed portrait of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and that is a simple line drawing done during her short reign as queen, and it doesn\u2019t bear a real facial resemblance to the Sittow portraits.We have none of Elizabeth of York from her lifetime, and the earliest portrait of Elizabeth Tudor is from her late teens, a painting she had made as a present for her brother. It isn\u2019t uncommon for there to be few images of women from the era, even extremely high-born women. There may, once, have been portraits which have been lost due to fire or neglect, or in Anne Boleyn\u2019s case, intentional destruction. Portraits were made on commission, and they were extremely expensive. They were often only made if there was a need for them, such as to entice a suitor to marry the woman. They could be created as gifts, as Princess Elizabeth Tudor did when she had her teenage portrait made for her brother, but that portrait had an important message \u2014 it showed her as a young girl, obviously not pregnant as was the common rumor once the story of Thomas Seymour\u2019s attempted molestation of her got around. By displaying it, her brother was stating publicly he believed she was innocent and untouched. But to commission one\u2019s own portrait just to hang in the house\u2026 that was seen as kind of vain.",

She is holding a rose to symbolize that she will be England\u2019s rose. As other people have pointed out, portraits were very expensive. Considering Ferdinand and Henry VIII, the men responsible for her, respectively, in her lifetime, had enough money for such things (although Henry fell rather poor later on in his life), I think the reason we don\u2019t see so many is because having your painting done was seen as quite self centered and also, more importantly, this was 500 years ago. Not every portrait/painting is going to survive. I doubt Catherine of Aragon\u2019s portraits were intentionally destroyed as Anne Boleyn\u2019s were, but time does do a number on flammable and easily breakable objects. And miniatures were easily lost. Logically, there was most likely a painting done at some point of Catherine and Henry and Mary, but we do not have it. Most likely at least half of the likenesses of Catherine of Aragon done in her lifetime did not survive, so we have to make do with what is left.",

Sadly with portraits from that time, very often it happens that pigments of hair darken(painters made their own pigments and experimented). Hence Isabella is in all her portraits shown as raven-haired. She wasn\u2019t and there is lots of historical evidence to prove it. Same with Juana, same with Katherine. The red-gold hair people nowadays think was auburn(because in modern meaning red-gold is auburn) we\u2019d nowadays describe as red-blond or blond red. Strawberry blond. But even though portraits got dark, illustrations(which were already around for a longer period) did not. This is Isabella with Juana. Just so we\u2019d clarify things.Unfortunately, many fans chose to photoshop the portraits we have of her and make her into the auburn. But originals don\u2019t show auburn-haired person. Katherine or her older sister Juana:   The last one with the baby seems to be slightly more to red-because discoloured varnish is not yet cleared. After future conservation works her hair will look just the same as in the first one. .. No way she was auburn. Sorry folks. \u2026 As for Katherine not being painted as Queen in 1510s, there are several possibilities why:Superstition.I am not sure where I heard it but there was once superstition that woman shouldn\u2019t be portraited while pregnant, that it was bad luck. If it was indeed true and been believed in Tudor England, it could explain it. Katherine was almost constantly pregnant in years 1509 to 1518. (And in the gaps, it is suspected that there could be more pregnancies than just 6. We know that Wolsey wrote for example about one in late 1511, saying ,the Queen is thought to be with child.\u2019 They really often weren\u2019t sure at those times until woman\u2019s belly started to show. And if miscarriage occurred in the first trimester, we wouldn\u2019t hear about it. But Wolsey is certainly credible source(unlike many who speculated about Katherine\u2019s pregnancies in her lifetime)-being Almoner(on council) personal friend with King etc\u2026, which brings a number of pregnancies to 7. And there really could be more. Some speculated that real number was between 7\u20139 pregnancies in 9 years.) Which could explain why she didn\u2019t have any portrait made. However, it doesn\u2019t explain why her husband doesn\u2019t have a surviving portrait from that period either, except one made in 1509. 2. The portraits of Henry and Katherine somehow got destroyed, without any copy being made. That could only be if originals got destroyed already in Tudor period, probably in Henry VIII\u2019s early reign. We know there was fire that destroyed royal lodgings in Old Westminster Palace(which was royal residence) in 1512. If Katherine and Henry got any portrait done prior to that, it might have been destroyed. 3.Originals are destroyed(or lost) and copies are not recognizeable. There are many copies of portraits of Katherine, where we have no idea what happened to originals. We can concluded that based on different jewelry, different blackwork and different style of hoods in copies of her portraits-that Katherine really had many many potraits made. At least 5 or 6 portraits with same style of hood-with white bits on side(lenght and shape of those white bits changed through out the years\u2026)This one is hideous. But the costume matches the timeperiod.Based on portraits of other ladies in Tudor court made by holbein, it seems like this is fashion of 1520s.This one should be later than 1527(there is portrait of lady with similiarly style chains from that time, that is when the style appears in England. But was used later too.) We have copies and drawings made based upon it, but original is nowehere to be found. \u2026These were made in cca 1520(could be prior) and are original. The portrait of Katherine was previously mistakenly identified as Katherine Parr. They just figured it is Katherine of Aragon in 2013.) Notice the hood, the white bits go down. And it is assumed that is fashion before mid 1520s, Possibly late 1510s. However we cannot be sure, that originals also had the the white bits going to the side. Best example is this copy of Monkey portrait.Katherine\u2019s good white sides are very pointed to sides, going up which is 1520s fashion. However, the hood\u2019s veil being pinned to the side is fashion appearing in the 1530s. We\u2019re talking late Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour\u2026 It is based on the same lost original, that Horenbout(miniaturist who only arrived at Tudor court in 1525) based his miniature on. But his survived, unlike the original.And undeniably the back of hood\u2019s veil is not pinned. So\u2026just because something looks like it is from the 1520s or 1530s, doesn\u2019t mean it is. So some of Katherine\u2019s portraits which you think are all from the 1520s, might actually be younger. Painters of copies might have just taken the liberty to \u2018correct\u2019 them. 4. Portraits simply didn\u2019t get made. So any portraits prior to 1512 could have gotten destroyed, but what about later years? In 1513 Henry was away in France fighting, so I doubt either of the royal couple would sit for a portrait at such time. And afterwards, King and Queen had a big falling out. (Yes already at that time. And no it wasn\u2019t all just about their children dying, another part was mainly because of Katherine defending/excusing her father(who betrayed Henry big time!) and Katherine screwing up her regency(basically English won more like despite her actions, not because of them\u2026if you look at it closely-she didn\u2019t go to North, the report about speech to troops in Midlands comes from an uncredible source outside of England, etc.)which lead to Henry VIII really cutting her off from any decision process-and she still expected to be treated as his equal-except she wasn\u2019t. She was Queen Consort, not Queen Regnant. So it couldn\u2019t be as it was between her parents.) And this cold breeze pretty much lasted to end of their marriage, though got a bit better with the birth of Mary in 1516. So it is possible that their marriage not being well, resulted to painters not being sent for, possibly for several years until King\u2019s anger about his father in law\u2019s betrayal disappeared. \u2026 But even though there is no sure portrait, that doesn\u2019t mean we have no depiction of her from that time. 1509-double coronation(they are both sitting in this one, hence it looks bit weird.)1511-Westminster Tournament roll-close up of Katherine and her ladies. (At that time we can see the hood veil(back part of the veil, not front bits) were worn completely down, as in Elizabeth of York\u2019s times. However, it is not yet fashion for the veil of the hood to be always black.)Or stain glass in Vyne chapel. It is not sure when exactly it was built, but given Katherine is depicted rather good looking and style of clothing of both King and Queen, I\u2019d say it was at least commissioned prior to 1520s. Tudor Stained Glass Restored - NewsWindows of this chapel depict Henry in middle and two women on his side. On his left is supposedly Katherine and on his right his sister Margaret. (Though to me the one on right looks more Katherine\u2019s only daughter\u2026)\u2026This depiction of her shows Katherine\u2019s hair undoubtedly as blond. (And it was done in her lifetime by ranking Tudor courtier) And her husband with much darker hair-because he was dark auburn, and she was more into blond than red.(She was a dark shade of strawberry blond).\u2026Another miniature which is also undoubtedly her. But showing Spanish style hairdress, same as her mother wore.(and it actually might be the one some people in past described as Italian hat because it is really similar to one hairdress fro Italy.)But what I noticed only recently is the chest jewel on that miniature. And we all have seen it already. Even though this miniature isn\u2019t famous and most people don\u2019t know it exists. But even so, they have seen this jewel no doubt!Want to guess? You really have seen it before.\u2026 Alright, no more teasing. Jane Seymour wore it on her official portrait by HolbeinIt is possible that pearls were later addition or that on miniature they are simply not in view, but it is the same jewel.And it is supposed to say IHS. And if we look at another jewel that Katherine wore-it either says IBS or IHS. So this could be also the same jewel. Or Katherine had more religious jewellery in a similar style. \u2026 Strangely enough, each depiction of her shows her with rather a prominent nose.",

When his were painted, it was probably when he was in his mid to late 30\u2019s when he started to pile on weight\u2014like his grandson Henry VIII, who was also known to have been thought of as very handsome before he packed on the pounds. Edward was not as gross as Henry, however; he was described as having put weight on round the middle but was not \u2018fat to the point of deformity.\u2019 Interestingly, despite Shakespeare\u2019s descriptions and the Tudor-centric writers he borrowed from, Edward\u2019s brother Richard was at least named as the \u2018most handsome man in the room save for his brother Edward\u2019 by a woman known as the \u2018Old Duchess\u2019 who claimed to have danced with them both (it was probably her Mother.) Certainly the NPG portrait of Richard, despite the later additions of over-painted wrinkles (revealed by Xrays), is one of the more attractive ones, despite the usual bad perspective of medieval paintings. Looking at the facial reconstruction of Richard from his skull, the resemblance to the portrait is quite strong, and there is also resemblance to his brother facially, although frame-wise he was light-boned and about 5ft 8 (probably about 5ft 6 with his scoliosis.)",
            "There have been a few. Henry II was said to have been quite handsome, as was his son Richard I. Edward IV was renowned for his dazzling good looks, and his grandson Henry VIII in his youth was called \u201cThe handsomest prince in Christendom\u201d.",

How many wives did Henry the eighth have beheaded reports:Anne Boleyn, Henry's second wife was born between 1501 and 1507, married Henry in January, 1533 and was tried and beheaded for treason, witchcraft and incest on 19th May 1536 in The Tower of London. It is generally agreed that the charges were trumped up and baseless. He just needed out of the picture because someone else had already pursuing his next wife. . . Anne Boleyn was beheaded because Henry wanted to get remarried. She was accused of being a witch and of treason by means of adultery.Henry VIII of England - Wikipedia tells us:Anne's downfall came shortly after she had recovered from her final miscarriage. Whether it was primarily the result of allegations of conspiracy, adultery, or witchcraft remains a matter of debate among historians. [57]Early signs of a fall from grace included the King's new mistress, the 28-year-old Jane Seymour, being moved into new quarters, [98] and Anne's brother, George Boleyn, being refused the Order of the Garter, which was instead given to Nicholas Care [99] Between 30 April and 2 May, five men, including Anne's brother, were arrested on charges of treasonable adultery and accused of having sexual relationships with the queen. Anne was also arrested, accused of treasonous adultery and incest. Although the evidence against them was unconvincing, the accused were found guilty and condemned to death. George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536. [100] At 8 am on 19 May 1536, Anne was executed on Tower Green. [101] The day after Anne's execution in 1536 the 45-year-old Henry became engaged to Seymour, who had been one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting. They were married ten days later. [102]No, there was no remorse. He moved a new mistress into the Palace while Anne was yet alive; became engaged to Jane Seymour the day after Anne was executed; and married her 10 days later. Meanwhile, how did he treat his daughter, Elizabeth, who probably reminded him of Anne?Anne Boleyn Marchioness of PembrokeLate Elizabethan portrait, possibly derived from a lost original of 1533\u201336 [1]From Elizabeth I of England - Wikipedia:Young ElizabethA rare portrait of Elizabeth prior to her accession, attributed to William Scrots. It was painted for her father in c. 1546. Elizabeth was two years and eight months old when her mother was beheaded on 19 May 1536,[10] four months after Catherine of Aragon's death from natural causes. Elizabeth was declared illegitimate and deprived of her place in the royal succession. [11] Eleven days after Anne Boleyn's execution, Henry married Jane Seymour, who died shortly after the birth of their son, Edward, in 1537. From his birth, Edward was undisputed heir apparent to the throne. Elizabeth was placed in his household and carried the chrisom, or baptismal cloth, at his christening. [12]Anne Boleyn - Wikipedia echos the sources above and provides more details. Henry was so busy with all of this and only thinking about himself, not about his daughter who was about to be made motherless. He cared very little about a girl child! It is satisfying to see the motherless child restored her mother\u2019s name years later:Henry was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth. Anne subsequently had three miscarriages, and by March 1536, Henry was courting Jane Seymour. In order to marry Jane Seymour, Henry had to find reasons to end the marriage to Anne. Henry VIII had Anne investigated for high treason in April 1536. On 2 May she was arrested and sent to the Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers \u2013 which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her own uncle, Thomas Howard\u2013 and found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge. [6] [7] After the coronation of her daughter, Elizabeth, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of John Foxe. [8] Over the centuries, she has inspired, or been mentioned, in many artistic and cultural works and thereby retained her hold on the popular imagination. She has been called \"the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had\", [9] as she provided the occasion for Henry VIII to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and declare the English church's independence from Rome.The only remorse Henry VIII ever felt was when he did not get what he wanted. (Quora A2A)",
            "The only person Henry VIII is on record as having regretted killing was Thomas Cromwell. I don't think there was any suggestion in his lifetime that he regretted killing Anne Boleyn, so he probably didn't.",

To Henry women were commodities (more akin to property than human beings). They were pawns to be used in political alliances and apart from that served only one other purpose - sex. Catherine of Aragon was a political pawn. She married his older brother and when he died she was \u201cdamaged goods\u201d. If she went back to Spain unmarried her life would have been meaningless. She successfully stayed in England by becoming the first female Spanish Ambassador and stayed in England for seven years before finally convincing the young Henry VIII that marrying her was a good idea. Her downfall was not having a male heir and Henry convinced himself that due to Leviticus 20:21 their marriage was sinful. Leviticus 20:21 says \u201cif a man shall take his brother\u2019s wife, it is an unclean thing. They shall be childless\u201d. Of course they weren\u2019t childless, they had a daughter but daughter\u2019s weren\u2019t relevant. He had received a Papal dispensation to marry Catherine but he later convinced himself that this was not agreeable to God and after breaking from the Church in Rome and establishing himself as Supreme Head of the Church, he discarded of Catherine and annulled their marriage. Catherine was a useless barren harridan in Henry\u2019s eyes and she was now a threat. He shut her up in draughty Castles for years and she eventually died of cancer at Kimbolton Castle, Huntingdon on 7th of January 1536. Anne Boleyn is misunderstood. She has been characterized down the years as an ambitious wanton who seduced the King into marriage. The reality is he pursued her for years and wouldn\u2019t leave her alone. Today this would be classified as extreme harassment and stalking. She tried to get away and didn\u2019t want to end up like her sister who he had bedded and discarded. She was in love with someone else (a man called Henry Percy) and was actually engaged to be married but Henry ordered her engagement to be broken off. In the end she realized that she was a hunted prey. He wanted her and he was going to get her whatever the cost. Anne was not going to be damaged goods and so she stipulated that he could have her only if he made an honest woman of her. It worked. Sadly for Anne once he had hunted, he wasn\u2019t interested anymore. He had a series of love affairs after that and grew tired of her. It didn\u2019t help that she didn\u2019t produce a son either. She was arrested on trumped up charges of treason and adultery and was executed on May 19th 1536. Jane Seymor was an easy piece of skirt. She had been a Lady-in-waiting to both Catherine and Anne and was unassuming and pious. She was just a push over and even her motto was \u201cbound to obey and serve\u201d. She was successful in giving Henry a son but died not long after in childbirth on 24 October 1537 at Hampton Court Palace. Anne of Cleves was a very clever woman. History suggests that Henry found her ugly but it is my personal belief that she found HIM ugly. She was horrified at their first meeting and I don\u2019t think the feeling ever changed. By this point he was morbidly obese and extremely unwell. He had an ulcer on his leg which was treated in unconvential methods by Doctors who frankly didn\u2019t have a clue what they were doing. He is known to have remarked around the time of his marriage \u201cI like her not\u201d. The marriage was never consummated and was annulled. She agreed to the annulment. She was not going to go the way of Catherine of Aragon and was not going to go back to Cleves. Like Catherine of Aragon she would have been regarded as damaged goods but by divorcing Henry and staying in England she received a handsome divorce settlement of Palaces, houses and land and was given the status of the \u201cKing\u2019s sister\u201d and rank immediately after all members of the Royal Family. Successive Monarchs changed their religion and she just went along with it. When Catherine Howard was executed, she suggested to the King that they might remarry. He refused. Anne knew the King would never contemplate remarriage to her and it kept her on side as it flattered him. Anne of Cleves eventually survived Henry and all of his wives and died at Chelsea Manor during the reign of Mary I on 16th of July 1557. Catherine Howard was just a young, na\u00efve, impressionable bimbo. She was a trophy to Henry that he could show off to his court and to the world. He thought it would arouse jealousy as how could such an old, decrepit, fat man have ever managed to make a beautiful young girl love him. The truth is she had practically been forced into marriage. Her Family had pressurized her into believing it was her duty to marry the King and to strengthen the Howard claim to the throne by having a Howard King and to bring Catholicism back to England. The sad reality is that this young woman was not the virgin that she had presented herself as. She had had lovers before she met the King. Marrying the King must have scared her out of her wits. He was a chronically obese old man with a smelly leg and probably had diabetes too. Sleeping anywhere near him must have been hell on Earth. Then Thomas Culpepper came along (a man of her own age) and she fell for him. Sadly, they formed an adulterous liaison and Henry found out. His \u201crose without a thorn\u201d wasn\u2019t unblemished after all and he broke down in the council chamber. He wasn\u2019t crying for her - he was crying because he\u2019d been cuckolded and shamed. She paid with her life at the Tower of London on 13 February 1542. Catherine Parr was no more than a personal assistant and nurse. She was a safe option in his old age. She brought his children from his previous marriages back together and succeeded in creating a patchwork Family. She narrowly escaped with her life when she argued with the King about religion. He was outraged that she would dare to instruct HIM (a King and a man) on anything. She was a stupid woman in his view who had forgotten her place. He ordered her arrest but she managed to reconcile with him before the arrest could be carried out. It is rumoured he was thinking of taking a new wife (a woman called Catherine Willoughby) but he died on 28th of January 1547 at the Palace of Whitehall. Catherine Parr survived Henry and married Thomas Seymour (Jane Seymour\u2019s brother) and died in childbirth at Sudeley Castle on 7th of September 1548. Henry VIII didn\u2019t love any woman in my view. He was an egotistical narcissist who viewed women as nothing more than baby making machines and pawns. In fact, I think the only person Henry VIII really loved was himself and possibly his Mother and younger sister who he named a warship after called The Mary Rose.",

After Anne Boleyn's execution, King Henry VIII had all her portraits destroyed across the country and made it illegal to own one. For this reason, we still do not know what she looked like, exactly, especially because letters and journals written of her posthumously only mock her and misrepresent her appearance - lies like she was covered in warts, her nose was so long it touched her chin, and she had a sixth finger on her left hand, etc. Queen Elizabeth I not only wanted to know what her motContinue ReadingAs others have mentioned, Queen Elizabeth I wore a golden locket ring with her mother's picture in it. After Anne Boleyn's execution, King Henry VIII had all her portraits destroyed across the country and made it illegal to own one. For this reason, we still do not know what she looked like, exactly, especially because letters and journals written of her posthumously only mock her and misrepresent her appearance - lies like she was covered in warts, her nose was so long it touched her chin, and she had a sixth finger on her left hand, etc. Queen Elizabeth I not only wanted to know what her mother looked like, she wanted a picture of her that she could look at often. She also had to keep it secret, hide it somehow, and keep it in a place that nobody would find it. She was a real rebel.Queen Elizabeth commissioned the ring from an artist who knew Anne Boleyn during her lifetime. It's the only surviving, somewhat accurate portrayal of Anne Boleyn that we know of. Also, Queen Elizabeth I frequently gave out lockets as gifts and they became widely popular after that. It's believed the locket was both invented and popularized by Queen Elizabeth I, herself. As for Elizabeth's affection for her father: he not only had her mother killed, but also, all throughout her childhood he would either call her illegitimate and send her to live outside of court or he would bring her back to his side and accept her. He was very black or white, hot or cold about his relationship with her. Elizabeth I was a skilled woman of the feminine arts, like needlework, and she was always steady in the way she portrayed her affection and loyalty to Henry VIII as seen in her many handmade gifts and poems she sent to him whether she were excommunicated or when she was home.This is a book cover that Elizabeth I gave to her father as a Christmas present when she was very young. Inside, she translated Henry's last wife, Catherine Parr\u2019s, prayers and poems into Latin for him. In that day, embroidered book covers were seen as very fine and they were extremely expensive to make (let alone to buy). They were usually made with velvet, however the one in the picture above was made of a fine burlap (not the kind we have today, but a very, VERY fine burlap). She was young when she made it, and the obvious grid of the burlap would've helped her keep her stitches even. Aside from her handy work, Elizabeth also fluently spoke six languages by the time she was six. Whether she had true affection for her father is debatable, but she was a highly intelligent woman. She kept herself alive after many plots against her life, she ascended to one of the highest thrones of the time, held that position for forty years, expanded the wealth in her country, invested heavily in the arts, and gave the throne to the best candidate available - which was also the most advantageous option for her country. At the end of her life, she secured peace and prosperity in her land by creating an alignment between England and Scotland, who, previously had been at war for hundreds of years. England has been among the most powerful nations in the world, and Queen Elizabeth I is among the best monarchs England ever had.(There\u2019s the ring, and that adorable creature on her arm is called an ermine. They're seriously adorable!) EDIT: WOW!! I haven't looked at this in a while, and I'm surprised it's received 3k upvotes! Thanks guys!!
