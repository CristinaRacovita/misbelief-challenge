            "if it in the daily mail it likely wrong anyway my guess would be that engaging your brain into any complex activity can boost your mind a bit actively listening to music and no mozart probably isnt special cant be a bad thing",
            "and no mozart probably isnt special as it happens the mozart effect what most people tend to be talking about when this come up is only recorded a working with one piece his sonata for two pianos its a temporary effect lasting no longer than 15mins according to the other comment and i dont even think it been reproduced a a study even with the same piece not sure about how music in general help though i assume attempting to focus whilst listening to complex music may not be particularly beneficial and id assume neither is listening to music with word you can understand but the mozart effect isnt really a common or significant effect",
            "while i dont believe that listening to mozart in particular ha such an effect there is growing evidence that music generally ha several positive effect on the brain  not only in the area of memory but also in development a strong connection to memory seems to make sense a we all know how powerfully a familiar piece of music from our past can evoke memory of more than the music itself it is also wellknown common practice to make information easier to remember by making a rhyme or tune containing the information rather than just trying to remember the data in an unstructured way httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfdfvsfxjxms httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvr0jkcyz8hng httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5gdwhw9duo httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv6qhlv2aje4 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvf3mffkmar4 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvljbgl1uzl6k",
            "yeah you will use 12 of your brain after listening to mozart which basically make you a super human most people only use 10",
            "listening to any piece of music will not boost your memory other than of that piece of music",
            "there have been study showing correlation between listening to classical music and mental improvement i dont remember whether memory or iq or maybe i havent listened to enough classical music but a far a im aware there been nothing to show causation and a common theory is that parent who are more likely to bring up child to listen to classical music are often also parent who are more likely to help their childrens development and education edit from wikipedia httpsenwikipediaorgwikimozart_effect they gave research participant one of three standard test of abstract spatial reasoning after they had experienced each of three listening condition a sonata by mozart verbal relaxation instruction and silence they found a temporary enhancement of spatialreasoning a measured by spatialreasoning sub task of the stanfordbinet iq test rauscher et al show that the enhancing effect of the music condition is only temporary no student had effect extending beyond the 15minute period in which they were tested the study make no statement of an increase in iq in general because iq wa never measured later on say this with 3 citation the mozart effect is likely just an artifact of arousal and heightened mood another edit the mail article you mention is talking about a study this year but not sure it conclusive they measured how listening to it affect electrical activity in the brain and then said thats a pattern of brain wave activity linked to intelligent quotient iq memory cognition and having an open mind to problem solving but no actual testing of any of those thing to see if they were improved nor mention of whether it had any lasting effect or just shortterm again",
            "not to sound like a pedantic as but remember that listening isnt just hearing i imagine regularly actively engaging your brain in anything is good for your brain function doesnt have to mozart either",
            "this wa part of a learning philosophy called suggestology founded by dr lozanov i think it morphed into binaural beat which are sound that can enhance all sort of human function such a sleep delta learning and meditation also check out focusatwillcom",

            "nice to see my research first author get this attention it is quite misrepresented though a we did not measure dopamine level directly ",
            "misrepresented journalism sounds like youve finally made it to the big league haha",
            "while reading this i asked myself should student and teacher try to change the environment their are learning in a often a possible then would it make a difference if you study in the same room for a few week or study a few week in a new room everyday",
            "one of the aspect i enjoy most in game is exploration i assume it work for virtual environment too",
            "boost dopamine level is a nonsense phraseprojected to the hippocampus is also nonsense dopamine is a neurotransmitter it is manufactured and stored in small vesicle at the extremity of neuron and is released into synapsis whereupon it is reabsorbed or destroyed within millisecond neurotransmitters are not like other hormone such a adrenaline or thyroxine that are released into the blood supply there is little or no dopamine sloshing around in your brain there are only dopaminergic neuron ie neuron that use dopamine to transmit signal across a synapse and yes reward are mediated by dopaminergic neuron but so are dozen of other process how we increase level of a neurotransmitter in a synapse and what the actual effect of that are is very poorly understood how we measure the amount of dopamine in a synapse is not clear since they are just 2040 nanometer wide one could not use visible light to see one and do spectroscopy for example blue light wavelength are an order of magnitude longer than a synapse ie 450 and 495 nanometer so there are a chain of inference in the story a presented that dont seem valid to me",
            "ops title is not the actual article headline the article and actual article headline do not have the issue youve pointed out",
            "as the first author of the paper i would like to straighten out that we did not manipulate or measure dopamine in this study we conducted it in a science museum in amsterdam so we used purely behavioral measure also note that the notion of hippocampal dopamine underlying the effect of novelty come from a robust literature in animal mostly study that do use pharmacological manipulation and neuroscientific measure the formulation of dopamine projecting to the hippocampus date back to an influential theory by lisman  grace 2005 which is why this wording is still prevalent in the literature",
            "if one us a dopamine reuptake inhibitor doe that not increase the total amount of dopamine in the neuron and synapsis",
            "ah so playing no mans sky for hour every day ha been helping my memory no wonder im a genius",
            "anecdotal but anytime i travel it like my brain gain superpower in my home city and state i have the worst sense of direction when i am in europe i am a god damn gps i always thought it wa because i felt le safe due to the new region but this also make a lot of sense"

            "theres a sub on reddit called science based parenting which is basically a hub for the world most anxious parent to seek scientific validation for various parenting decision big and small i followed it for many month before i realized how bad it wa for my mental health seriously it a wild place i once saw a post where someone wa worried that their baby wa getting too much screen time because baby liked to look out the window and the parent wa worried the window count a a screen that sub is an anxiety vortex and personally i think a damaging place for anxious parent anyways i bring up that absolutely wild sub not to encourage you to visit it but because there is a very widely shared medium post that is frequently posted to that sub the author who i think might be a poster or mod on the sbp sub but im not sure ha aggregated the finding of several different study about daycare and ha concluded that daycare is detrimental to child under a certain age i think maybe 3 or so cant remember and beneficial after a certain age i think you and the other parent youre seeing in various forum might be referring to that piece that particular medium post get shared on that sub like it the bible and i wouldnt be surprised if it get posted like it fact to other place on the internet theres a lot wrong with that post particularly that medium is just a blogging platform that anyone can post on not a peer reviewed scientific journal the summary of the literature is cherry picked and then there a massive correlation v causation black hole that the author gloss over all that to say this particular article is posted and then parroted elsewhere like it scientific fact but really it a muddy a the rest of the research on this topic this lead me to my big question for you why do you care what the research say about this you say yourself that for your child daycare ha been very beneficial that is all the evidence you need and let say you found some ironclad irrefutable study that said daycare wa horrible for child under 2 would you change your life over it would you quit your job or spend more money on a nanny probably not because you probably gain additional benefit from working or saving money by not having a nanny so your daycare decision isnt made in isolation in parenting we constantly have to make decision that consider many many many different variable instead of just getting to choose the 1 scientifically best choice every time no parent can make perfect choice every single time we live in the real world not in a research study and we have ton of complexity to consider beyond just what the research say so i encourage you to let go of the idea that you need proof that your decision to put your kid in daycare is good or bad you have all the proof you need which is your own experience with your own child",

            "honestly i do not think it matter i think baby do fine in a good daycare and i think baby do fine at home i think what their research isi sahms wanting to validate themselves by shitting on all daycare thats all that is my kid didnt start until 12 month 18 month they had family and nanny prior and they transitioned well and are thriving not at 2 and 5 some kid may not be cut out for it and some mom arent cut out to stay home i know kid who started daycare at 6 week old and they are my kid peer and they are wonderful little kid basically what im saying is ignore these people i dont know what research they looked into but situation differ so much and not all kid and daycare and family are the same what make a good parent is a present and involved parent whether they work or not",
            "i like rsciencebasedparenting but sometimes wish the discussion on childcare wa more nuanced i read both the often cited medium piece which function a a bit of the author own lit review not a peer reviewed piece on it own and the underlying study along with additional research on childcare from my own lit review the truth is quality of care matter a lot in the early year and that is well rooted in pretty much all the research of early childcare high quality care can be delivered lot of way  through daycare center through nanny through parent through in home childminders and it true that the younger your child is the more important quality care is for them because beyond physical safety a lot of childcare quality is driven by investment in a strong connection between infant and caregiver and tight feedback loop between child and carer so that the kid need physical social emotional are met by that carer a lot of people see research that point to negative outcome of daycare which are primarily behavioral and point at daycare a the problem but it more that it can be easier to deliver high quality care in a 11 model and more challenging to deliver it to a group that in no way mean that group care cant deliver high quality experience  there is lot of good evidence that high quality group care is great for kid a bigger problem is the childcare quality crisis at least in the us it is really tough for parent to find high quality option  fewer than 10 of group care environment meet the criterion for high quality care and 11 care isnt even really tracked for quality in a meaningful way much more useful than the question of is a daycare good or bad is the question how do i identify a high quality care option for my kid and support all kid having similar choice this is an excellent quality 101 piece from the center for american progress ps  this psychology today piece is i think a fairly balanced take on the research surrounding daycare i particularly like the conclusion at the end of the day home and daycare are not competitor but collaborator and should not be conceptualized a being at odds or in conflict with each other what us parent and child need their childcare system to provide is high quality affordable and accessible care as with healthcare the childcare system in the us ha struggled mightily and thus far unsuccessfully to provide consumer with service that combine these three essential quality in the us today affordable and accessible care is often of low quality high quality and affordable care is inaccessible to most and care that is accessible and high quality is often prohibitively expensive this state of affair is not satisfactory and should be unacceptable in a nation that aspires to prize and protect it child family and future",
            "there are just so many pro  con it is super challenging to get decent research due to all the correlational factor that make measuring challenging such a socioeconomic status interaction in the home interaction  quality of the daycare the temperament of the child parenting skill of the parent one of the best study that i read over a decade ago and i do not have a link wa examining language and behavior and it did find statistically so once again not every single one that kid that started daycare center a young infanta were lea developed in language skill  had more behavior problem a they entered toddlerhood however by the time they were 5 and still in daycarepreschool setting they actually were statically ahead of peer who were not in such setting with the observation this occurred in a population where parent were college education and obviously had a higher household incomehence why they were in daycare already the intense desire to protect and do the best for our infant can be consuming when in reality overall majority of kid are pretty resilient there are advantage to watching peer there are advantage to have a sole caregiver focused on kid specific need v 3 or 4 at a time there are advantage to avoiding the germ infested daycare and yet there are advantage to having higher income and opportunity due to finance in the entire 18 year there are just a lot of way to raise happy kid into kind respectful adult eta  mom of 3 infant kinder daycare alum who are the most awesome thriving kid love em and would do it all the same way again to have them just the way they are",
            "heres my synthesis work in education and ece research have read all the thing and thought about what they mean in reality a a working parent with no interest in leaving my job from age 35 there very strong evidence that high quality ece setting prek child care head start etc have academic and non academicsel benefit to young child v not being in ece or being in a lowquality setting from age 03 there strong evidence that what matter most for kid is a safe caring environment with lot of adultchild interaction and attention to healthy child development and stimulating ageappropriate play which can be provided at home in group child care by relative etc many path to those same result one thing i told myself when my son wa first going to child care wa he learning that the world is filled with more caring people and fascinating thing than the people and thing in his home in term of defining quality thats tricky but at baseline for me it mean low adultchild ratio safe and healthy classroom environment educator who get support and development themselves solid structure and routine and intentional playbased curriculum approach aligned to childrens age and development and for kid of all age there extremely strong evidence that a lessstressed parent and more economic security is always beneficial so for me having my kid in a reliable highquality care setting le stress enables me and my husband to work at job were good at enjoy and make a good bit of money doing economic security",

            "this area is wrought with correlationcausation problem on the fat people dont live a long side is the issue that in general folk who are overweight dont eat well dont exercise dont take care of themselves i would think these three factor in and of themselves would have far more impact on longevity than adipose tissue now iirc the group with the greatest longevity were slightly overweight which immediately call into question the definition of overweight i really hope they used caliper or immersion test for body fat  if they used heightweight chart then the entire study is a useless a those chart for one thing anyone who us bodyfat chart and is honest will tell you that a segment of the population where they are wildly wrong is  people with significant muscle mass you know  like people who exercise a lot i suggest that instead of at target weight v slightly overweight the group is actually people who eat well and exercise regularly and some have slightly more body fat than others within that group i suspect folk with a bit more body fat have greater energy reserve and are better able to survive minor malady this is all layman couch analysis take with a grain of salt",
            "i saw the same story httpwwwwebmdcomdietnews20090625studyoverweightpeoplelivelonger i found it very interesting i dont know why there arent more study like this all the major long term study include height and weight measurement i dont know why this type of info cant be discerned from those a well edit did sample calculation based on the study for a 59 person this would mean about weighing 170 to 200 lb about 130lbs overweight to give an idea we arent talking about 100lbs overweight or anything helping you stay out of the coffin longer",

            "not really if it really bother you that much youre better off buying from local farmer where you can go and see their farming practice organic doesnt mean what people think it mean and on top of that some farmer cant afford the certification cost for organic even if the food is organic i usually buy produce on discount for myself because thats what i can afford fun fact most of the time the cheaper produce also so happens to be the seasonal produce",
            "organic doesnt really change the nutrient content of food i buy organic because synthetic pesticide are more dangerous for farm worker and synthetic fertilizer are worse for the environment than nonsynthetic one of course you dont need to buy certified organic produce if you are simply getting your produce farm local to you who follow organic gardening practice but just arent certified much of my produce come from farm which arent certified organic but also do not use pesticide and use soil amendment they create themselves from orchard mulch or manure you should look into a csa near you by googling your metropolitan area csa vegetable oftentimes youll have to pay for 10 week in advance but you get a lot of food buying food from your local farmer will also increase it shelf life since it wa likely picked that day and didnt spend day or week in a trucked edit also a an american i feel like it really important to buy tropical fruit that are certified organic and fair trade since youre basically outsourcing pollution and poorly paid unsafe labor to these place",
            "it depends on how much money is worth to you pesticides are measurably unhealthy and organic food is measurably healthier the impact doe vary from food to food there are some food i dont bother with and some food i wont eat unless it organic also there significant damage to the environment like the extinction of native bee thats worth considering",

            "people love to forget that the biological purpose of breast is solely to feed offspring sure they can look nice and be fun to play with but they literally would not be part of our anatomy if they did not play some role in our survival a a specie human edit people are making the point that boob are a secondary sex characteristic and therefore are not just for feeding but i ask you what is the biological drive behind sexual attraction could it possibly be that a mate displaying a perceived ability to take care of their offspring is viewed a more attractivebecause of the implied ability to procreate in victorian england wealthy woman would place padding in the midsection of their garment to appear pregnant because that wa attractive at the time why wa it attractive at the time because it implied an ability to carry a child not really sure how else to explain this to you guy im not saying society ha not evolved in more nuanced way in regard to sexuality but thats anthropology which by the way ha not existed a long a animal mating and giving birth ha",
            "while it is definitely true that the primary purpose of breast is feeding in all mammal it is hypothesized that in human with standing upright it became harder to tell fertility by looking at the butt and so sexual selection ended up in human woman having permanently enlarged breast a feature unique to human but it is still a hypothesis check out httpswwwdiscovermagazinecomplanetearthscientistsstillstumpedbytheevolutionofhumanbreasts agreed with the op in we need to chill about breast especially in the context of breastfeeding because that is the 200 million year old purpose of mammaries and agree with you that it is the primary purpose but we cant say it is the only purpose in human there is good reason to believe that sexual attraction is a secondary purpose",
            "i had a friend who not only didnt want to breastfeed her own baby she felt such revulsion towards it that she couldnt even stand to be around other woman who were doing so she would either leave the room or ask them to go somewhere else i wa once nursing in another room and said something to her and she said please dont talk to me while youre doing that she grew up in a very religious household i actually felt bad for her that her mind had been warped to that extent",
            "to be a tiny bit fair there is an actual condition where breastfeeding can make you feel physically or mentally ill and afaik it ha no correlation with religious upbringing but i dont think that extends to seeing other people breastfeed mostly just saying this for awareness because while there obviously a ton of stigma about breastfeeding in public there also a lot of shame and pressure for woman to breastfeed no matter what even at the expense of their physical and mental health",
            "just curious have you considered other cultural reason it may be weird other than sexualization i ask because the first thing that come to my mind doesnt seem inherently sexual to me that is that when my son is able to make verbal demand while still learning about empathy and respect and that people are not object neither i nor my wife want to hear him make these kind of verbal demand for boob tit milk or any such thing that verbal demand for someone el body from a child is the thing that make it weird for u same go for diaper my mom got me off diaper when i started eating real food and having real adult poop i protested saying i liked the convenience and that in itself convinced her that diaper needed to end we do not want our son being needy and demanding this seems to indicate a need within our culture to have our kid be independent early im sure there are study about whether there is any relation between breast feeding past toddler age and development of independence and empathy",
            "what is different from cry to asking verbally what about sign language my son could sign milk when he wa 9 month old what is the limit when he start trying to say milk or once he pronounces it properly being a late talker mean you need breast milk longer once they start asking for hug doe that mean you need to stop hugging them as soon a they start walking you cant pick them up ever or use a stroller you can walk now dont be needy nursing a toddler doesnt mean you need to obey their every command it is developmentally appropriate to say mommy is busy right now you need to wait until xx or to end a nursing session because you want to do something else the diaper thing is just weird if you could communicate to the point of saying it wa convenient you were waaay past the point where you stopped having baby poop that transition happens when they start eating around 6 month and is generally completed by 1 year old when they are eating larger quantity of food your son will be needy and demanding no matter what you do that is what kid are they need you to care for them because they are not adult i dont have knowledge of study connecting breastfeeding and independence but there are study showing that attachment parenting style which often includes extended breastfeeding cosleeping positive reinforcement going at your child pace lead to more independent child because they are more secure in their parentchild relationship",

            "so i am going to add to this comment because i think you hit it on the head one study showing a correlation is actually very weak evidence for something additionally a you have pointed out there are confounding variable i can think of parent education level parent income parent ability to have a stay at home parent exposure to teratogen and on and on if you want to get a better picture of something like this look for a metaanalysis of many study and the evidence will be stronger as a personal anecdote i am in medical school and a researcher to get into medical school you have to take an exam called the mcat you might think mcat score and matriculation into med school have to do with iq but they dont they are more strongly correlated with parent wealthincome so data can be misleading and correlation is not causation not arguing with the above comment just adding to it tldr do what work for you op i wa formula fed i am not behind my peer because of it",

            "im guessing it probably not worth that much one of the big way that hitler funneled money to himself wa by having the party and the government buy copy of this book and then give it out to people for all sort of stupid reason like having a kid or an 8th kid or getting married or being in the hitler youth or being on the deans list or graduating or enrolling etc etc they tried to gift germans with a copy for just about any life event they could think of so that hitler could get the book sale it also allowed hitler to brag that his book wa a best seller in much the same way the gop buy copy of book like eric trumps triggered and give them to donor so that eric can say he wa on the ny times best seller list if it wa published in 25 it might be worth a lot but the market wa pretty flooded by 33 although not a bad a it would be by 38 the 39 edition i think is more valuable bc it wa a special birthday edition and then later copy copy start becoming more valuable again bc germany didnt have the capacity to print very many late in the war there were about 10 million copy printed in germany a country of about 70 million people so 1 for every 7 people but id maybe check liveauctioneerscom there wa a big ny times article last week and apparently thats the big market place for this stuff and maybe talk to the rare book dealer at place like powells or daedelus book",

            "its basically just an incoherent rant put to paper even during nazi germany people thought it wa a bad book but didnt say anything",
            "if you want to learn about hitler dont read mein kampf the book composition wa him pacing around his cell ranting to his deputy rudolph hess who duly transcribed what he could of hitlers incoherence on a typewriter the book then went through 11 or 12 draft just to become legible the initial draft were completely unreadable the other comment here saying it is incoherent ranting are literally true the book wasnt written per se a just edited version of hitlers rant id recommend ian kershaws twovolume biography of hitler provides an academic and indepth research of his life and character with a bunch of stuff thats not well known i still remember the section where he living in a shelter being homeless and his old housemate interviewed would complain about him stomping his foot in the attic where he lived and yelling doing what hed later be worshipped for and creating a huge racket made me laugh how relatable that is of shitty people to someone hitler really wa just another terrible housemate to have to live with",
