            "the evidencebased approach tell u a great deal 0 we start with the null scenario where there is nothing except what we observe we observe the physical brain let start by saying that because people living people have functional brain it is a necessity 1 you move on to what you have and can observe we see that all human who are conscious and functional have a known range of measurable brainwave pattern that mean brainwave and brain death are indicated by electrical activity 2 you can induce coma with drug you can induce altered perception and consciousness with drug that mean the physical brain is at least responsible for perception and consciousness 3 components of the brain are directly linked to mental faculty if you remove the rear parietal lobe you see loss of vision if you sever the corpus callosum you get two independent brain half that have trouble agreeing if you stimulate the gyrus you can induce sensory and memory perception these are similar cross human a shown by brain surgery test and thus the evidence show at least a functional physical brain with repeatable structural significance to each region 4 consciousness a evidenced above is tied to measurable brain activity in that lack of brain activity is correlated with lack of consciousness that mean at the least it is directly tied to the brain 5 more recently we have found we read the electrical pattern of the brain and map them to repeatable and testable image thus we can guess at what you are seeing or dreaming by watching your brain activity everything in our evidence so far is physically connected to the brain obe test have failed in surgical context as a matter of probability in light of the evidence we have so far there is no reason to believe that consciousness is something other than the process of the physical brain as op said we do not know the mechanism precisely however lack of knowledge is lack of knowledge we cant presume the source other that to say statistically it appears that it would come from the physical brain in the last question op pose who is doing the observing is somewhat nonsensical  your brain is doing the observing clearly 1 because it is wired electrically to your sens and 2 we can read the pattern and reconstruct what it is observing with computer the most likely unproven hypothesis is that consciousness is a product of the evolved higher brain function designed to compensate for longterm knowledge management rather than immediacy ie you need to contemplate thing and remember and plan in a hypothetical way to make better decision consciousness is probably one such method of doing this",

            "i am my reason i am not my nose i am not my lung i am not my hair i am not my emotion i am not my brain i am however one specific function of my brain reason when you see a cat the light hit your eye travel down your optic nerve hit your optic lobe and is processed a a shape there is no part of this so far where you have done anything this is the work of your property then broadly speaking the brain crossreferences the image against previous image still not you yet the action of linking the cross referenced notion of a cat with the sense data where another part of your brain will recognise the parallel that process is you the further process of connecting novel distinction emerges from this process finding any higher order lead to fatalism which is totally valid of course yet i have no rational mean of falsifying the concept so i have to put a pin in fatalism and leave it a a frustrating maybe until a better mind than mind can demonstrate it to be correct id like to put my definition to ops talking point and see what can be concluded the coma my definition is seek to describe a person not cast a value judgement on them in a coma are they a person yes people often dream in coma and are affected by stimulus on a subconscious level reason is happening therefore they are a person while in a coma but what if youre hit over the head and are out for a few minute is an unconscious person a person if their brain is at that moment not rationally processing my definition of i concludes that they are indeed not a person there just the potential for personhood laying in a heap on the floor a all the equipment is still there and it reasonable that the equipment will refire in a minute whom owns the equipment of an unconscious body does this somehow make rape moral if they blacked out there wa no transaction made so while they briefly do not exist a a person a third party cannot claim ownership of the body just a you cannot walk up to a factory on a sunday and claim that business a yours just because no one is there physicality physicality is the equipment used to navigate life you have property that help you ingest food ware off attacker feel anger be hungry this is all your equipment you are the process formed by a small part of that equipment and you occur in sporadic yet fairly constant burst all over the brain which lead onto the next topic quite nicely streams of consciousness this is where it get interesting we know that there is no one physical centre of the self in the brain it just mostly towards the frontal cortex my definition assumes that you are the process of rationality a it occurs so if you occur in one corner of your brain then occur in another part of your brain let say youre struggling with a math problem and you think of sex where are you located in this scenario the answer is simple you exist simultaneously in different area of the brain a thats where the process are taking place is each individual instance of rationality a separate you if so why doe it feel like it all in one place in your consciousness it would be easy to just define the self a the collection of piece of reason process at any given time and call it a day but thats philosophically lazy its clear that indeed if reason is happening in different part of the brain and they are no connected by another piece of reason governing them both they are separate instance of you occurring in tandem my definition fails here if science can demonstrate that there is a higher order that governs all the individual instance of rationality a a separate process in which case my definition would change to that process that governs the sporadic burst of reason and reason itself a a process becomes just property of that higher self the hard problem this is not a problem it is a rejection of reason in favour of emotion and mysticism we cannot define consciousness because it stem from the idea of a soul which is a faith based conviction consciousness doe not exist the brain is either processing or it is not processing consciousness simply doe not exist it may describe a fluffy version of my definition of the self that you are your reason everything else is your property or science may demonstrate it existence a a higher order function but until that time i reject it a i reject anything else fundamentally irrational it is both childish and arrogant to assume that there is a something special divine or otherworldly to the self if they have evidence i am happy to hear it but i disregard their pitiful wishful thinking as op state very well nondesirability ha absolutely no impact on fact room for optimism this is an excellent way to look at how thought work assuming my definition of the self that were nothing more than complex clock doe not mean that we cannot experience and relish that complexity of course thats assuming were not just fatalistic debris where our action would be determined by the law of physic the moment the universe came into being if anyone can shed more evidence what would reshape grow or challenge my definition id encourage you to respond",

            "thanks for this great summary i wonder if it possible to hand the game record to an expert go analyst without informing himher that one player is alphago and asking for an analysis of each player strength and weakness it strike me that the comment about alphagos play great at task requiring lot of computation and standard play lack creativity and insight  are almost exactly the comment one would expect to be made about a computer player before one ever observes the computer play so how much are the comment influenced by the prior it might even be more interesting to inform an analyst that both player are human and see what the resulting analysis yield about alphago",
            "i think there might be some bias in how they put it but at it core they werent like speculating but really founding the analysis with clear and repeated example of alphagos play the lack of creativity is something that is also a problem for many human player it is the difference between being told how to play by player better than you and actually understanding why youre doing certain move on your own the former can get you to do the right move in 90 of the case but you need the latter to recognise the 10 when you need to deviate from standard play it should also be noted that a they said in the beginning they were focussing their analysis on the thing which felt bot like they zeroed in on those instance were alphago wa making mistake unlike those a human player would make at that level in general their response and that of many pro is that alphago played very much like a human and if theyd just been given the game note they might notve guessed it wa an ai playing",
            "word of warning im a crap go player and i dont know many of the detail of how the ai in this case actually work this make sense from what i know of go and the complication of creating an ai to play the game in go there are always a ton of different move compared to a game like chess which ha a lot of permutation but only a few move per turn and a lot of ambiguity this is often what make it such an intuitive game you cant really say there any one reason why you prefer one move over another since there so many move where each is only slightly more beneficial than another the ai seems to have the sort of setback that i would imagine it would have theyve managed to make it general enough that it can recognize general pattern and position on the board into a sort of familyresemblance of game and choose from it repertoire plausible arch to go for so it sound like it playing on a level thats above tactic but still not quite the highlevel strategy that really good go player play with",

            "the one angle which is most interesting to look at is form if you take fan huis comment seriously he did not consider the computer a threat coming into the match likely he did would not have taken a large amount of time to mentally prep for the machine beat down he expected the machine beat a low level pro who probably spent very little time preparing for the match now you have a top pro with 2 month to get in top shape for a set of match with a huge purse which guarantee the pro will be in top form the physical an mental preparation for high level board game play for human player is difficult to understate",
            "among the three traditional go powerhouse china korea and japan could you describe these national playstyles",
            "i havent kept up with this for a while but historically japan dominated go throughout twentieth century they had very old gomasters battle each other for whoever might be the best of the best they also sorta sent goaid to korea and china where go wa not in the best shape ever and provided opportunity for go player there however by 1990 korea and china started to emerge a very potent go country with very strong emphasis put on practicing go problem and raw ability to read ahead young kid started to dominate the go world and their style wa increasingly aggressive and fightoriented by comparison japanese style with much tradition behind it sought to establish very elegant balance between two side with relatively simple sequence chosen mostly throughout game this style however simply wasnt good enough korea and china with their child prodigy just passed by japan modern study seems to indicate that actually twentieth century great japanese player in fact did often misread sequence and had much weaker local reading ability than modern pro to some extent they made up for it by having extremely good sense of balance and flow of the game but ultimately raw reading ahead ability seemed to dominate korea especially wa known for their player that would choose extremely complicated move and make really difficult fight happen this is the korean style youd so much hear about and lee sedol wa the one that managed to prove that this brutal and inelegant style could in fact beat the more elegant style held by older pro lee changho in particular lee changho wa known a the stone buddha in 90 he wa the strongest player on the planet with very calm move and very calm appearance during game there were plenty of player trying to beat him with this korean style but lee sedol wa the one that finally took him down sedol wa kinda posterboy for the reckless fighting style of modern korea i dont really know how china fit in all of this their style seems closer to koreans but it not really a flamboyantly reckless",
