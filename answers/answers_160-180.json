two collection of number how can we compare their size if the collection contain only finitely many number like 4 8 15 16 23 42 and 227 314 22371 0 1 2718 we can of course just count the number of element in each collection for example the two collection mentioned above have 6 element each so they are of equal size but if we try to do the same for infinite collection we are more or le out of luck so what do we do one answer in fact the usual one is to think of size of collection in a different way for example when you lay the table for a lot of guest you might find yourself not counting the number of fork or knife and instead just making sure that every plate get exactly one fork and one knife this is another way to determine whether two collection of thing have equal size just see if you can find a way to match up every object in the first collection with exactly one object in the second collection in such a way that no object in either the first or the second collection go unmatched for instance we can once more see that the collection from the previous paragraph are of equal size just match them up 4 8 15 16 23 42 227 314 22371 0 1 2718 this way of measuring size actually work for infinite set a well for example we can immediately show that there are a many odd positive integer a there are even positive integer by just matching every odd positive integer with the next integer like this 1 3 5 7 9 11  2 4 6 8 10 12  to be absolutely certain that this work my table must be made in such a way that if you give me an odd integer i can give you the one and only corresponding even integer and vice versa and this is certainly true in this case to show that these infinite size are a bit strange i will now show that there are a many integer a there are positive integer just pair them up like this 1 2 3 4 5 6  1 1 2 2 3 3  we can for example see that the positive integer 219 pair up with the integer 110 and that the integer 73 pair up with the positive integer 146 now let get to the interesting bit how can we know that there are more decimal number mathematician call these real number between 0 and 1 than there are integer i will show that there are more decimal number between 0 and 1 than there are positive integer since the collection of integer is of the same size a the collection of positive integer this is all i need to show to begin with assume that the collection of decimal number between 0 and 1 and the collection of positive integer are of equal size then we must be able to pair the two collection up imagine that we were to do this to obtain a list of all the decimal number between 0 and 1 it would look something like this 1 2 3 4 5 6  0121031 0892300 0545545 0618709 0001115 0333333  note that any of the number in the second row may have infinitely many digit 13  0333333 for example if one of the number ha an ending decimal expansion like 14  025 rewrite it with trailing zero like 14  025000 the trick is to now create a new decimal number by picking the first decimal of the first number the second decimal of the second number the third decimal of the third number and so on and to increment all these by one except for 9 which wrap around and becomes 0 with our assumed list above we would get something like this original decimal number chosen digit incremented new number 0121031 1 2 02 0892300 9 0 020 0545545 5 6 0206 0618709 7 8 02068 0001115 1 2 020682 03333333 3 4 0206824    0206824 the new number that we form is then 0206824 and this number is not on the list because it first decimal is different from the first decimal of the first number on the list it second decimal is different from the second decimal of the second number on the list and so on so that the new number differs from any given number in the list in at least one decimal this method work no matter how we try to list the decimal number between 0 and 1 just write the list down you cant write the whole list down on actual paper of course but you get what i mean then choose the decimal like above increment them with wrap around from 9 to 0 and create the new decimal number so we can conclude that no matter how you try to pair the decimal number up with the integer you will always be missing at least one decimal number among the pair therefore there must be more decimal number between 0 and 1 than there are positive integer im aware that my explanation is a bit long and perhaps too difficult for eli5 but it is my firm belief that a diversity in the response will increase the chance that one answer is good so i contributed with this one if you are interested in the argument i used it is called cantors diagonal argument since the decimal that are chosen in the construction form a diagonal edit there are lot of rather confusing and wrong answer in this thread and since the objective with my post wa to provide a thorough complement to the other answer ill expand my response a bit more first of all there is a fair bit of math lingo in this thread perhaps the word are obvious to everybody but in case they arent here a list of some of them natural number  the same a positive integer so 1 2 3 4 5 and so on are the natural number some consider 0 to be a natural number a well both choice are fine in the context of your question rational number  the same a fraction since every integer can be written a a fraction like 7  71 this includes the integer examples 0 619 12 5454 real number  the same a decimal number well deci in decimal stand for ten so when we speak of a decimal number it is also understood that when we write the number down we write them in base ten examples 0 1 37 \u03c0 pi 2 76 many decimal number like the last three of my example have decimal expansion that never end that decimal expansion can be neverending is perfectly fine and is in fact crucial to your question functionmapping  if you have two collection of thing like 1 2 17 cat and 0 bob 1 a function mapping is the same thing between the two collection is a way to pair up each member of the first collection with exactly one member of the second collection there is no requirement that every member in the second collection should belong to some pair for instance this defines a function between the two example collection 1 0 2 0 17 bob cat 0 injectionsurjectionbijection  these are all different thing and are additional constraint on function a function from one collection to another is an injection if each value in the second collection occurs in at most one pair so my example function above is not an injection since the pair 10 20 cat 0 all have the same object 0 from the second collection a function is a surjection if no object in the second collection go unmatched the example function is not a surjection since no pair contains 1 in it second position there is no 1 in the second column finally a function is a bijection if it is both an injection and a surjection in other word every object in the second collection must me paired up with exactly one object from the first no more and no le so in fact two set are of equal size exactly if there exists a bijection between them the example function is not a bijection since it is neither an injection or a surjection my list is not really li5suitable but neither are some of the word themselves now people below uscylla6 if i interpret himher correctly claim that there are more fraction than positive integer this is simply not true in fact the collection of fraction is of equal size a the collection of positive integer ill show this like above remember that what i need to do is to pair every positive integer up with exactly one fraction in such a way that every fraction can be found in a pair the idea is to just write the fraction down in a big array and to then walk along the diagonal 11 12 13 14 15  21 22 23 24 25  31 32 33 34 35  41 42 43 44 45        by walking along the diagonal i mean this doing so we can pair up positive integer with fraction leaving none out like this 1 11 2 21 3 12 4 13 5 22 6 31 7 41   to be fair i have cheated a bit since i only have positive fraction but this can be fixed like with the integer above also 1122 and so on so i have only really showed that there can be no more fraction than positive integer but all integer are also fraction so there cant be more integer than fraction thus the size are equal",

            "the entire concept of nation state of ethnically and culturally similar people is very young prefrench revolution people just didnt think that way everyone wa a subject of their respective king had their cultural custom and spoke a particular language while some people may speak the same language a few town down the road they might do so in a weird dialect and do thing slightly differently belong to a different king or a free city and therefore are not the same the idea of the german culture group ha existed for a while at least since the holy roman empire got the addition of of german nation nationis germanic\u00e6 to it name in 1512 however the latin natio did not have the same definition or usage a our modern word nation and there wa a political idea behind that addition the idea only got traction after the french revolution when the idea of a nation state united by people of a common culture rather than a monarch became popular and student and academic movement made it their own which lead to the march revolutions and the revolution from above of 1871",
            "this exactly what i am asking i wasnt asking about the nation state the german state can be easily traced back to 1871 and the reunification i am asking specifically about a german cultural and linguistical and historic identity in the 1700s",
            "one way to look at this is from a cultural perspective you can find sign of a german identity way back in the work of wolfram von eschenbach and walther von der vogelweide 955 otto the great led a group of german tribe against the hungarians also  despite all inner fighting there always have been a feeling within the different germanic tribe that they share something common  setting them apart from the romanic or slavic tribe for example so yes  if you want to see them you can find lot of sign for a german identity in the early year",
            "yes i think this sum it up nicely there wa a common german culture in all the various kingdom territory etc with broadly the same language with local accent for a long time yet there were local difference that still are noticeable to this day bavaria being one example regarding the op question i would say it a bit of both a unifying underlying culture and language since very long back plus a growing together in the decade and even century leading up to the mid 1800s while a strong regional feel and tradition remains",
            "i guess you will have to be more concrete in your notion of german identity at the time of napoleon germany consisted of a many small state speaking different language having different religion and having had very different history german wa however a language that wa exclusively written and used for diplomacy and trade in the habsburg empire and the hanse i believe in my opinion bavaria wa culturally closer to austria at that time than to hannover",
            "in my opinion bavaria wa culturally closer to austria at that time than to hannover probably still is",
            "the lingua franca of the hanse wa predominantly low german",
            "the idea to put german speaking people in the same category is definitely older than 1800 culturally speaking i remember that bach wa included in a list of the most famous german composer in 1754 in the musikalischer bibliothek of miszler a opposed to italian composer or french composer maybe the modern meaning of the word identity is not helpful to explain how people who referred to themselves a german understood it but german a an umbrella term for the people who spoke all dialect of german language existed and wa used well before the napoleonic wars",
            "its hard to define a common german identity even today culture wa and is very regional and those cultural trait that are broader include area that dont belong to germany so yes while most region share some characteristic with their neighbor these characteristic are rather fluent and change the further you go from any defining point which will make it hard to define where german characteristic stop and nongermans start",
            "httpsgeschichtefandomcomdewikideutsche_identitc3a4t according to this article a movement started propagating a common german identity since 1770 not sure if this is the answer you want so maybe you want to try and translate that article somehow",
            "was there a concept of the germans yes absolutely theres no doubt about that for example the v\u00f6lkertafel essentially a list of stereotype about different nationality is from the early 1700s the ten nationality it list are spanish french italian german english swede polish hungarian muscovite  russian and turk or greek apparently those two were considered to be nearly identical the idea that german identity didnt exist at all prior to the napoleonic war is common but really oversimplifies thing the term deutsch and deutschland to refer to the language and the area in which it is spoken or sometimes the entire hre are very old what is true is that with the napoleonlic war a new wave of german nationalism and german national identity wa started but i would say thats more a reaction to the fact that the hre aka the german empire a it wa called by most people at the time wa suddenly gone so essentially a replacement wa needed german may not have been the thing that most people would primarily identify a but it wa absolutely a thing and had always been a thing at least since the formation of the hre even the language they spoke were not mutually intelligible thats bs written german wa already pretty much standardized at the time and city dweller especially people travelling around could definitely speak like that too so you would hear a difference in accent but the language would be the same of course if you had some illiterate farmer from southern bavaria and another illiterate farmer from the coast neither of whom had ever left their village they would have had a lot of trouble communicating even today local dialect of german can be quite difficult to understand for speaker from other area but the written language wa basically fixed and the same everywhere and it had slowly converged over many century",
            "i think vorm\u00e4rz is what you want to google",
            "as many have commented before it is a hugely complicated topic of course the idea of a german identity did exist but the question still is for whom a you had part of italy france belgium and the netherlands a part of the holy roman empire of german state and of course not to forget austria and switzerland were also part of it i would say that through different occurences through the year some of these state got closer together if you look at prussia forming eg or later on the northern alliance in the south you had something similar happening and those alliance changed through the year and so did the culture  feeling of a german people i would say from what i gather of it pre1800 a kind of sense of one german people did not exist but rather a few that shared some cultural heritage but differed in other way after 1800 that change through different circumstance culminating in the unification war against france where france did not expect the southern state to honor the alliance with the northern state in essence i think what one can find throughout history is the question of a common enemy if one think back in the german sense to the ottoman empire being in front of vienna that created a common enemy that wa close and not far off in constantinople and that is what kind of drove the german identity to incorporate the state that came together in 18701871 this is also why the napoleon war were significant for the german identity a napoleons france served a the common enemy threat that drove that identity the first time",

            "maybe the british are more comfortable with who they are generally the white picket fence look of people who have had cosmetic dentistry work doesnt appeal to everyone some people teeth give their face character even if theyre not perfectly even its a bit like people who over pluck their eyebrow the face lack something in expression and look kind of weird ricky gervais keira knightly and lara stone are good example of british celebrity who wont have the white picket fence treatment and martine mccutcheon is a perfect example of overworked teeth looks terrible when she smile like shes wearing someone el teeth",
            "because british people are used to receiving healthcare on the nhs rather than through private insurance the nhs only cover functional dentistry not cosmetic dentistry like orthodontic brace for the most part",

            "agree with the point about fluoridated water  there been talk in the uk healthcare system for the last few year about mass water fluoridation actually although nothing ha been actioned a of yet as a brit i dont agree with the drink a lot of tea stereotype however sure some people drink tea but there a whole bunch of brits who dont the few americans ive met over the year didnt tend to have particularly noteworthy teeth and im sure they would have said much the same about me",
            "its quite probably partially because of ancient stereotype  elizabeth 1 is stated to have had horrible blackened teeth mainly due to the introduction of sugar which wa incredibly expensive so only the really rich could afford it and then they used massive quantity of it then there what others have said  we go for function over form if someone teeth are a little crooked so what braces are for correcting underoverbites and readjusting a crowded mouth rather than concern on fixing crooked teeth mind you know who the oecd say have the best dental health on average the british with le than one decayed missing or filled teeth in a 12 year old study from 2006"

            "i danced exclusively in europe and a bit in south east asia depending on the scene where i started off a little college town in western europe there were a couple  few nonwhites but at larger city or event the non white remain a minority i think when i wa in heidelberg for chase in 2019 there wa only like 5 non white i dare say",
            "im in europe the scene in most european country is very white if you want to be thought of a a good dancer there a pressure to travel to other city in europe to learn at festival from a wide range of teacher some people dont have the time or money to do that the uk is probably the most diverse scene i have seen but it is still quite white the organiser of a festival london throwdown cancelled it because they felt they still had some learning to do and people of color told them that they didnt feel comfortable a white person got really angry in the facebook comment on the post announcing the cancellation and said that it wasnt a problem i think there are some european country where there isnt that much diversity because for example they didnt rule over other country or dont take asylum seeker so this lack of diversity isnt seen a a problem racism is thought of a an american import and there is no need to address the lack of diversity which mean that when a person of color turn up they can be made to feel a little exotic",
            "writing granted i have met some very lovely people who write but it a hobby that tends to attract really pretentious douchebags who sneer at everything while insisting theyre really deep people who blindly refuse to listen to critique and are already setting their mind on fame and fortune before the novel even done and usually are mediocre at best random crazy folk you know what your novel need horses really lovely kind friendly people whose writing is absolute garbage who you feel awkward interacting with because youre either going to have to lie to them forever or probably break their heart",
            "i really enjoy music festival specifically bluegrassjam band type festival but i cant stand a big segment of the crowd plenty of the people there are out to enjoy the music and meet people and are generally friendly and kind but there always a big segment of the crowd that i cant stand  aggressive people who are out for a fight cursing out other people in the crowd or people who just get a kick out of being an asshole it also make me sad to see people who are so zombied out on drug that they cant enjoy the music im not bashing people for doing drug that would be hypocritical on my part it just bum me out when people are so gone that they pas out on the ground in the middle of a concert or look like they dont even know where they are i wa at a leftover salmon show a couple year ago and realized that almost no one in the crowd wa mentally there enough to appreciate anything that wa going on i wa right up front and it looked to me like the band could tell too they actually looked kind of exasperated and disappointed it could have been that i wa imagining it or that they were tired cause it wa a really late show but it definitely made me see part of the festival crowd in a new light edit added a couple word for clarity",
            "maybe not hate but loving anime im slightly saddened by how much the fanbases of certain series with their unbalanced attitude can distance potentially interested people"

            "im borderline with this one but because you announced your nickname on the family whatsapp group right after the actual baby wa born and their actual name wa announced im leaning toward yta you should have been more subtle about it and waited for a more appropriate time to do it",
            "you already posted about your dil not wanting to come home for christmas in your response you justified this nickname issue by saying your daughter were always fine with it and ok if you had just picked the nickname and offered it and then gone ok i understand sorry if i overstepped when they said they didnt want to use the nickname youd be fine but afaik you have yet to apologize or realize your relationship to your dil is a unique relationship in which you must respect her boundary instead of just blundering around making assumption that you can do whatever you want cuz your daughter are ok with it so yta",
            "yta theres nothing wrong with nickname but they should be organic they are usually based on the name or a term of endearment in your language or just something that evolves organically when youre talking to the child its not just another name that you choose to give the kid because you like the name that youre choosing",
            "yta for announcing it on a family text did you even clear it first with your dil and son did you get their approval of it before announcing it to the whole family if you want to nickname the baby after being around them a a term of endearment then thats fine but announcing it in a way where it like here the nickname i picked out is an overstep and if i wa the daughter and not consulted first id think who doe she think she is have you even met the baby yet if not it just sound like the whole nicknaming thing and the way youre going about it is a way to make it all about you",
            "yta it wasnt a nickname it wa an actual name",
            "have you considered doing something like a secret santa or white elephant my family is also very large and for every christmas weve ever had we do a secret santa name picked at thanksgiving so everyone only ha to buy 1 present and receive 1 present kids are excluded and it expected youll bring a small toy for the little one",
            "if i may add to this my family doe something similar but we add to it we call it special person and around thanksgiving we draw a name but here is where it get fun not only do you get that one person a gift and often time it not even a purchased gift you can clean their car make frozen meal for the college student etc you also are supposed to do extra nice thing for them in the lead up to christmas maybe you offer to babysit or you get them coffee or whatever and then on christmas eve we all get together and everyone guess who had their name and there is a big competition every year for who get guessed the most aka who wa nicest and did the most nice thing and there is a small prize for the person who get guessed the most so from thanksgiving to christmas the whole family is just on overdrive trying to be nice to each other",
