            "i agree that these airline are the worst but low cost carrier rake in the cash",
            "i flew spirit once before and got the big front seat upgrade after my checked baggage and the seat upgrade i wa slightly under the cost of other airline for the same route the big front seat wa really nice with ton of leg room and from what i understand it the equivalent of domestic first class seat on other airline i think with spirit you have to know what youre getting and adjust expectation accordingly and youll be fine there wont be snack service but the flight attendant and gate service agent were all friendly and i thought it wa more comfortable than the american airline i took on the way back and i got the extra legroom on american airline a well",
            "american is by far the worst airline ive ever flown with their whole operation is held together by duct tape and bubble gum not sure why people make out spirit and frontier to be so bad",

            "i grew up i guess rich and this wa pretty normal for u i think it both about privilege and a difference in lifestyle a lot of the thing that i have seen or heard people with le money complain about are thing that i experienced growing up too not having a place to do homework and doing it in bed not having a dinner sometimes kind of a lot of the time the past few year and just scrounging something up going to school with hole in your shoe it could be because my mom grew up poor so thats what shes used to or because mental illness run in our family but i feel like it also just a difference in lifestyle i see absolutely nothing weird with having pb and j for dinner every so often even if youre a millionaire i know that i have a ton of privilege that other people dont have like being able to afford medical bill and not having to worry about moving around a lot and yes having ac but having a full blown family meal every night isnt something we do i guess because of your boyfriend upbringing not just how much money he had but also his family lifestyle and being able to afford to make those choice he think that not having a full blown dinner is very out of the ordinary when really it isnt",

doesnt adhere to that the specie which survive and reproduce tend to be most prolonged doesnt make it their purpose i think that for u human the most coherent position would be to treat all other life form equally and that is to view them a resource to prolong our existence so the only moral consideration for any animal including human is how doe this benefit me also how doe killing and eating animal benefit anyone if they can simply go without to base their value only on how useful they are to our survival but still be mindful of their suffering and try to minimize it why bothering minimizing suffering or being mindful of it if the animal ha no value this seems contradictory you seem to recognize that animal have enough value not to suffer beyond some arbitrary limit but why doesnt that extend to not being killed if a pig ha more value to u by being turned into food then i dont see why we should refrain from eating it if a human ha more value to you by being turned into food or enslaved exploited or killed doe that morally justify doing so i dont think any life form except our own should be given intrinsic value why not if they have thought and feeling like u are they not valuable like u keep in mind how it is impossible to draw the line which life form should have intrinsic value and which shouldnt but you drew a line you just drew it at human empathy can be extended to nonhuman animal a cockroach ha 1 million neuron while a bee ha 600 thousand neuron i cant see many people caring about a cockroach more than a bee jellyfish experience a lot le suffering than a cow a dog is way more similar to u than a whale in appearance and in behavior which is why most people value dog over whale but nothing make a dog more intrinsically valuable than a whale you can value all of these thing enough to not warrant pointlessly killing them without worrying about how they rank against each other you draw the line at human why do all human share all the valuemaking trait having subjective experience having a mind having feeling is enough to warrant consideration dogs and whale both have that what doe it matter what it look like but all life form want to survive for those life form that do want to survive that is reason enough not to kill them but not all life ha cognitive faculty which are essential to wanting anything weve only seen that in animal yes single celled organism plant or fungi dont feel pain like animal do right there is no self in there they dont subjectively experience existence but im sure they dont consider death in any way preferable to life not do they prefer life to death because they dont have preference we can relate to a pig suffering but cant to a plant suffering because pig can experience suffering like u and plant dont consciously experience anything all organism are just program with the goal to multiply that multiplying is favored by natural selection doesnt make it a goal animal are the most complex type of program but they still have the same goal a a plant or anything else plants dont have goal humans transcend this value judgment because our goal is to prolong human specie existence this is not true of everyone and it an arbitrary distinction why would prolonging our specie make u more valuable why wouldnt prolonging some other specie and every one of u should hold intrinsic value to everyone else why you could equate this to white supremacy but i see it a an invalid criticism since at this point in time we have a pretty clear idea of what homo sapiens are why is the morally significant factor whether a group can interbreed the main thing that we use to categorize specie in this belief system human feeling and emotion are still more important than other creature life why in other word you have to make them feel bad for eating animal isnt this true of any moral position someone ha to be convinced of the goodness or badness of it to be moved this is just another moral consideration which some people ignore or dont understand if someone ha such a strong craving for meat that it impossible to turn them vegan thats not real life anyway people choose selfish pleasure over moral choice all the time that doesnt make them moral i believe this position is better for mitigating suffering than any other except full veganism but is more coherent than the belief of most vegan i dont see how all that matter is what benefit me lead to mitigating suffering its also not coherent a you make exception for your favorite specie also eating animal isnt prolonging the specie if anything animal agriculture is damaging our home planet and poisoning our environment on an individual level abstaining from eating animal is correlated with a longer life eating animal doesnt do what you say it doe intrinsic value what do you mean by this as far a i can tell value is assigned not intrinsic",
            "thanks for taking the time ill raise some issue with some of your starting premise since others seem to be focusing more on where your argument lead re the the purpose of every life form is to further it own specie and i think most people can agree thing yes i know that isnt an exact quote i certainly dont agree im not sure i think people have purpose that they dont give themselves if what you meant is that it is some sort of moral imperative to ensure the survival of one specie then i think there some truth to this but not for the reason you seem to think i think it a fact due to evolutionary process that organism tend to act in way that further their own specie but im not sure that specie a whole are appropriate unit of moral consideration species in my view will only matter morally if and because individual member of specie matter morally if this is right then ensuring one specie survives is only morally required if and when doing so is necessary for fulfilling our moral obligation to member of our specie there is no independent moral obligation to ensure the survival of one specie we can test this conclusion with some thought experiment a if we were facing an extinction level event and the only way for some of u to survive wa to subject a small group of u to condition that were very very undesirable perhaps they even make life not worth living where theyd be able to continue the specie i dont think we could morally justify forcing people into these condition agains their will but if there wa a moral imperative to ensure the survival of the specie that wa independent of individual member moral right then surely the right thing to do would be to force a group of u to endure these condition against their will so it doesnt seem like there can be such an imperative b alternatively if you and one other person who wa of a sex that you could breed with were the only people left on earth but you didnt want to repopulate the earth with them i dont think youd be wronging the specie by choosing not to nor do i think theyd be morally justified in forcing you to have child with them in the name of ensuring the specie survived however if there were an independent moral obligation to ensure the specie survived youd be wrong to not be willing to procreate and it would at least be possible that the right thing for the other person to do would be to force you to procreate with them so it doesnt seem like there can be such an imperative 2 re the i would also assume that no person would refrain from harming member of another specie to ensure their survival this is clearly a descriptive claim one that may or not be true but you try to get it to do moral work that im not sure it can do im not sure it true that i would be willing to cause just any harm to just any member of another specie in order to survive if i wa trapped in a life boat with an alien that wa a smart a i wa could speak my language felt pain etc and we needed to decide who would be sacrificed so that one of u could avoid starvation long enough to be rescued i think id have a moral obligation to play rock paper scissors to decide who dy rather than simply try and kill them but this is sort of irrelevant because even if it the case that if i wa in a survival situation like this i would be willing to kill and eat the alien outright this wouldnt mean that what i did would be right you cant move straightforwardly from a psychological claim about people would be willing to do in a scenario to a moral claim about what are they justified in doing in that same scenario in sum then i think you argument is doomed from the start because it built on very questionable foundation  foundation which seem neither true nor capable of justifying moral aim at all",

in other word you have to make them feel bad for eating animal isnt this true of any moral position someone ha to be convinced of the goodness or badness of it to be moved this is just another moral consideration which some people ignore or dont understand if someone ha such a strong craving for meat that it impossible to turn them vegan thats not real life anyway people choose selfish pleasure over moral choice all the time that doesnt make them moral i believe this position is better for mitigating suffering than any other except full veganism but is more coherent than the belief of most vegan i dont see how all that matter is what benefit me lead to mitigating suffering its also not coherent a you make exception for your favorite specie also eating animal isnt prolonging the specie if anything animal agriculture is damaging our home planet and poisoning our environment on an individual level abstaining from eating animal is correlated with a longer life eating animal doesnt do what you say it doe intrinsic value what do you mean by this as far a i can tell value is assigned not intrinsic",
            "thanks for taking the time ill raise some issue with some of your starting premise since others seem to be focusing more on where your argument lead re the the purpose of every life form is to further it own specie and i think most people can agree thing yes i know that isnt an exact quote i certainly dont agree im not sure i think people have purpose that they dont give themselves if what you meant is that it is some sort of moral imperative to ensure the survival of one specie then i think there some truth to this but not for the reason you seem to think i think it a fact due to evolutionary process that organism tend to act in way that further their own specie but im not sure that specie a whole are appropriate unit of moral consideration species in my view will only matter morally if and because individual member of specie matter morally if this is right then ensuring one specie survives is only morally required if and when doing so is necessary for fulfilling our moral obligation to member of our specie there is no independent moral obligation to ensure the survival of one specie we can test this conclusion with some thought experiment a if we were facing an extinction level event and the only way for some of u to survive wa to subject a small group of u to condition that were very very undesirable perhaps they even make life not worth living where theyd be able to continue the specie i dont think we could morally justify forcing people into these condition agains their will but if there wa a moral imperative to ensure the survival of the specie that wa independent of individual member moral right then surely the right thing to do would be to force a group of u to endure these condition against their will so it doesnt seem like there can be such an imperative b alternatively if you and one other person who wa of a sex that you could breed with were the only people left on earth but you didnt want to repopulate the earth with them i dont think youd be wronging the specie by choosing not to nor do i think theyd be morally justified in forcing you to have child with them in the name of ensuring the specie survived however if there were an independent moral obligation to ensure the specie survived youd be wrong to not be willing to procreate and it would at least be possible that the right thing for the other person to do would be to force you to procreate with them so it doesnt seem like there can be such an imperative 2 re the i would also assume that no person would refrain from harming member of another specie to ensure their survival this is clearly a descriptive claim one that may or not be true but you try to get it to do moral work that im not sure it can do im not sure it true that i would be willing to cause just any harm to just any member of another specie in order to survive if i wa trapped in a life boat with an alien that wa a smart a i wa could speak my language felt pain etc and we needed to decide who would be sacrificed so that one of u could avoid starvation long enough to be rescued i think id have a moral obligation to play rock paper scissors to decide who dy rather than simply try and kill them but this is sort of irrelevant because even if it the case that if i wa in a survival situation like this i would be willing to kill and eat the alien outright this wouldnt mean that what i did would be right you cant move straightforwardly from a psychological claim about people would be willing to do in a scenario to a moral claim about what are they justified in doing in that same scenario in sum then i think you argument is doomed from the start because it built on very questionable foundation  foundation which seem neither true nor capable of justifying moral aim at all",

            "a lot of people are attacking you but i thought this wa really well written with some interesting point two thing spring to mind for me no life form would shy away from causing harm to individual of other specie to ensure their survival absolutely true but human have conscious thought and are capable of understanding a lot of nuance that just isnt possible for any other animal id argue that for a lot of animal they have no other choice than to attack eat andor kill other specie they just lack the reasoning capability to even make that decision in the first place no animal to my knowledge doe anything similar to the factory farming of cattle egg etc that we do  it isnt done for survival or out of necessity we arent competing with these specie for land or resource the other thing is the point you made about prolonging our own specie the greatest threat we face right now is climate change and going vegan is the second biggest impact besides never flying you can have in that fight",

            "interesting post may i ask why you think pursuing a specie purpose is always morally permissible even if we grant that a life form purpose is to prolong the existence of it own specie which frankly i would like to see some more argumentation that that is indeed the case it not clear that it moral to pursue that purpose suppose it is my purpose in life to torture and kill innocent child i find on the street is it moral for me to pursue my purpose clearly not after all whatever good in life that i get by fulfilling my purpose are drastically outweighed by the harm im causing to my victim similarly even if it is our purpose to prolong the existence of our specie it may very well be the case that there are way of fulfilling that purpose that cause more harm than good and hence are immoral indeed i think factory farming and animal agriculture in general is one such way a we are causing astronomic amount of harm in order to feed ourselves given that we can nourish ourselves in other way that would produce significantly le harm ie plant based diet i dont see how it can be moral to do it in the way we currently do let me know what you think",

            "you can see it very clearly on mass spectrum of chlorinecontaining compound there will be two peak 2 mz unit from each other one about a third the size of the other starts to get a little messy if you have multiple chlorine on one molecule though also this is a great point to bring up a well the atomic mass is a weighted average based on natural abundance so a single atom wont have a mass equal to what is on the periodic table but a large sample of atom of one element will roughly average to that mass",
