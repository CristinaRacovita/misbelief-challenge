Pakistan\u2019s network of high tech trade in advanced military weapons and other forms of technology reached it\u2019s zenith in the 1980s and 1990s when the vast expanses and uncontrolled border of Afghanistan permitted us to use the drug smuggling routes to funnel weapons technology from all over the world to secure warehouses in Pakistan, waiting shipment abroad. While every nation maintains networks specializing in weapons technology theft and so on, Pakistan punches well above it\u2019s weight thanks to a number of unique factors that grant it a lot of advantages. We all know about the latest news items about Pakistani intelligence operatives stealing certain technical data for the Indian Brahmos cruise and the recent episode involving American Radiation Resistant circuits being smuggled to the Chinese and Russian space programs by Pakistani assets. Smuggling of U.S. Technology Is Outpacing Cold War Levels, Experts Say BrahMos Aerospace engineer arrested for allegedly leaking information to Pakistan This is unsurprising for me, to say the least. The Pakistani black market trade in weapons ranging from simple Russian shotguns being manufactured in the North West to Space technology is a core asset of Pakistani strategic planners. An asset that was developed to compensate for our economic, industrial and military disadvantages vis a vis larger and more powerful and industrialized countries like India. The network\u2019s routes are far more ancient that some give it credit for. The \u201cAfghan smuggler\u201d is a constant phenomena in literature from Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u2018Kim\u2019 to other literary pieces and is a reference to how the Central Asian/Afghan routes have long been favored by smugglers who have carried trade and wealth across the vast steppes of Asia to connect the Middle Eastern empires and Ottomans to the Qin Dynasty and Mughal oligarchs since time immemorial. The Pakistani intelligence\u2019s appropriation of such networks is only a post-colonial manifestation of a phenomena that has existed long before Pakistan even came to be. The black market for weapons trading developed through a multitude of factors:The Afghan drug trade.The Afghan drug trade is one that spans a vast network of routes ranging from Europe to North Africa to South East Asia is closely integrated with the black market weapons trade. The smuggling routes for weapons and the criminal networks that utilize them are often used by intelligence assets in Pakistan to get their hands on weapons far and wide as they leverage the drug trade and financing operations to maintain proxies in combat, recover tech, project force and make deals for recovered drones and tech components far and wide.Possibilities for Illicit Trafficking in the Wake of Troop Withdrawal from Afghanistan: A Regional Problem 2. The Nuclear program and the BCCI/ISI front operations. \u201cPakistan\u2019s arsenal was built without the advantages that other members of the nuclear club have. It lacks the oil wealth of Iraq, Iran and the pensula sheikhdoms. It does not have the vast industrial base of its adversary India. It has neither Israel\u2019s abund(ant technical expertise and secrecy). Pakistan is therefore the exception that makes the rule. It is a model of how far a down and out nation can go in acquiring nuclear arms when its leaders combine unwavering resolve with flexibility and imagination. Pakistan is the Horatio Alger nation of the atomic age.\u201d Critical Mass: The Dangerous Race for Super weapons in a Fragmenting World, William E. Burrows. There has almost never been as large, as complex and as successful an international smuggling ring to smuggle key materials, technical designs and nuclear know how on an international scale as there was when the Pakistani nuclear program was begun. The entire operation was long studied and utilized by other nations like Iran, North Korea and Libya for their own operations but never really implemented as successfully. The network of intelligence, criminal elements, front companies, banking channels, money trails, smugglers and covert military elements that operate and maintain this vast enterprise do so with the blessing of Military Planners at the top in order to maintain a level of symmetry with the greater industrial power next door to our east. 3. The Afghan Jihad and the Madrasahs funding.It is a dangerous thing to forget the climate of your birthplace, to choke out the voices of dead relatives when in dreams they call you by your secret name. It is dangerous to spurn the clothes you were born to wear for the sake of fashion; dangerous to use weapons and sharp instruments you are not familiar with; dangerous to disdain the plaster saints before which your mother kneels praying with embarrassing fervor that you survive in the place you have chosen to live: a bare, cold room with no pictures on the walls, a forgetting place where she fears you will die of loneliness and exposure. Jes\u00fas, Mar\u00eda, y Jos\u00e9, she says, el olvido is a dangerous thing.El Olvido by Judith Ortiz Cofer The Afghan Jihad coincided nearly perfectly with the Nuclear weapons program which allowed Pakistan considerable breathing room in developing it\u2019s network of high-tech smuggling. More importantly, it enabled Pakistan to somewhat perfect the financing operations required to back up the entire enterprise, out of sight of most regular banking channels. From the International level BCCI bank to the Hawala system of funneling money through informal channels, the large finance network enabled the development of several front companies and payment methods that could sustain the international network for black market weapons. Too many spy films gloss over the dull and dreary details of front companies and money funneling that has to back up every large, international level network but it\u2019s literally the backbone that sustains the entire operation. The system had it\u2019s genesis in the 1970s when Pakistan first developed the financing operations needed to channel Gulf money into local madaris to erode the support base of ethnic nationalists fighting against the state. But then the system morphed into support payments for the Mujahideen, payments to front companies for the nuclear program, payments for the drug trade of the 90s, payments for armed proxies and so on. And became a much more larger and complex phenomena than originally designed. But the Afghan Jihad was the first battle field testing of the covert supply networks developed by the ISI which funneled money, high tech weaponry, intelligence, operatives and fighters from all over the world to the Jihad next door. The lessons and experience gained from this operation was also applied to the covert smuggling program to develop nuclear weapons leading to successes on that front as well. 4. Criminal elements and their nexus with the Intelligence apparatus.\u201cBrigadier TM\u2019s mistrust of the ISI was based on a simple principle: The cops and thieves should be organized separately. His problem with the ISI was that everything was being done by the same people. After sweeping through the living quarters with their bug detectors and scanners and patting the seats of some random chairs, they had simply signed a document saying no espionage devices had been detected. Brigadier TM never knew whether to trust these signed documents. After all, potential presidential assassins don\u2019t go about their business signing affidavits as they close in on their target. Brigadier TM had done his Staff and Command course, and he understood why a country needed an intelligence service, why an armed service needs to spy on its own men and officers, and he could live with that. But there was another reason he didn\u2019t like these military intelligence types. Brigadier TM didn\u2019t like them because they didn\u2019t wear uniforms. It was hard enough to trust anyone who didn\u2019t wear a uniform, but how on earth could you trust someone with a rank who didn\u2019t wear a uniform? Brigadier TM considered ISI a menace on a par with the corrupt Pakistani police and lazy Saudi princes, but since his job was to watch and keep quiet, he never mentioned it in front of General Zia.\u201dA Case of Exploding Mangoes, Muhammad HanifPakistan\u2019s unique strategic location may not have paid dividends in terms of international trade with our neighbors, but criminal elements have been quick to exploit it. The weak civilian state dynamic of Pakistan has resulted in powerful criminal syndicates operating in the urban and border regions of the country, quite often in cahoots with the military\u2019s intelligence apparatus. The vast plethora of crime syndicates that operate under the loose observation of the intelligence apparatus is mind boggling in variety: From Russian and Afghan drug smuggling syndicates, Drug dealers in North America, Car thieves, arms smugglers, ethnic gangs in the cities, money funneling services, front companies whitening money for tax evaders, paid hit men and of course, whatever proxies and mercenaries are up for hire. The benefits of such crime syndicates are that they have vastly greater ground level intel and operative capability than any militarized asset will ever have. And unlike terror outfits which are constantly hunted and strive for publicity, crime syndicates prefer to operate in the shadows away from the spotlight. Their job is to remain as underground as possible. This makes them excellent assets for any intelligence agency worth it\u2019s salt. And the presence and operative capability of very large and powerful crime syndicates allied with the military intelligence apparatus of Pakistan, gives the state immense power projection capability in the sphere of high technology weapons trading and theft in the black markets. I should also mention that individual intelligence officers also make quite a buck working shady deals on the side for criminal enterprises without their boss\u2019s know how at times, and with their deliberate blessing on other occasions (as long as you kick up 10% to your superior). Both cops and thieves in the same organization. What did you expect. 5. A dumping ground of weapons and weapon mixtures. Pakistan\u2019s ever shifting alliances and complex foreign policy situation has resulted in some of the oddest mix mashes of military gear the world\u2019s military apparatus may have seen. We have F-16s being directed by Chinese AWACS. We have Russian Tanks being fitted with American Anti-Tank devices. We have French submarines carrying Chinese missiles. We have Russian helicopters carrying European electronic warfare suites. We have Swedish AWACs directing Chinese fighter bombers. Combined with this odd mix mash is the fact that we have been severely embargoed for most of our existence or have been refused weapon sales for a long part of our existence. This has necessitated the development of covert networks to score supply parts, weapons integration and other forms of ingenuity to actually make the patchwork Pakistani military machine operate to some bare minimum standard in the first place. A phenomena that has dramatically multiplied the importance of our vast weapons technology black market. 6. Weapons trade: Trade one thing for another.When you come, as you soon must, to the streets of our city, Mad-eyed from stating the obvious, Not proclaiming our fall but begging us In God\u2019s name to have self-pity, Spare us all word of the weapons, their force and range, The long numbers that rocket the mind; Our slow, unreckoning hearts will be left behind, Unable to fear what is too strange.Advice to a Prophet by Richard Wilbur The purpose of this entire network is not only to funnel weapons technology to Pakistan. We simply dont have the industrial capacity to develop and manufacture all the technical documentation and know how we get our hands on. The point of this network is trade up: the Brahmos technical stats will be noted and recorded in Pakistani logs and battle plans but their main client will be sitting in China and the US. Even our good friend China isn\u2019t safe. Chinese large tech firms have been victims of Pakistani spying as well and their technical know how is often stolen by Pakistani intelligence operatives. Similarly, Russia, a proxy ally for whose space program a Pakistani asset was stealing the radiation resistant circuitry, has also been a victim of Pakistani intelligence assets: Operatives in Russia have passed on the metal designs and compositions used in Russian stealth aircraft to the Chinese on at least one occasion to help bolster the J-20 program (perhaps hoping for a discount on the aircraft if our air force ever decides to buy it). Another example of this is the trade between North Korea and Pakistan when the North Koreans had the medium range missiles but not the nuclear tech and Pakistan had the nuclear tech but not the medium range missiles. Resulting in a trade: Pakistan got North Korea\u2019s Nodong missiles and renamed them Ghauri and North Korea got centrifuges for their nuclear program. The weapons trade allows Pakistani strategic planners to build up a deck of cards to be used for trading stuff they actually need. If Pakistan manages to get its hands on US naval maneuvers or US naval technology being used in the North Atlantic or South China sea, its useless to us. But it could be traded with Russia in exchange for some know about the Su-30 radar in the IAF. Or to China for some intel on their own Su-30s. The point is to stack up as many trade secrets as possible to trade them for stuff we actually might need. China however, remains one of the primary non-Pakistani clients for the technology that ends up in Pakistani hands. When the stealth helicopter that crashed in the OBL raid was in Pakistani hands, it was investigated in detail by Chinese engineers. The technology to design the fuselage for a stealth chopper has long been public domain knowledge since the 70s (the US Army published it themselves), but the tail segment design was something that not many could seem to get their hands on. Which of course meant that a few years later, Chinese helicopters had tail segments closely matching those of the stealth chopper that crashed in Abbottobad. China has been the recipient of stealth aircraft air frame details, hellfire missiles IR sensors, NATO miltops, NATO helicopters, NATO aircraft, electronics and circuitry for European military grade equipment and so on through the Pakistani channel for a long time. A somewhat more well hidden aspect to the relationship between both nations for a long time. 7. An epicenter of constant hi-tech warfare.I have a special ticket to another planet beyond this Earth. A comfortable world, and beautiful: a world without much smoke, not too hot and not too cold. The creatures are gentler there, and the governments have no secrets. The police are nonexistent: there are no problems and no fights. And the schools don\u2019t exhaust their students with too much work for history has yet to start and there\u2019s no geography and no other languages. And even better: the war has left its \u201cr\u201d behind and turned into love, so the weapons sleep beneath the dust, and the planes pass by without shelling the cities, and the boats look like smiles on the water. All things are peaceful and kind on the other planet beyond this Earth. But still I hesitate to go alone.Another Planet by Dunya Mikhail Pakistan has somewhat turned into an epicenter of high tech warfare since the 1980s when the first Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan. This has meant a lot of weapons have been literally falling out of the sky as far as Pakistan is concerned. I remember back during the peace process talks vis a vis Israel a long time ago, some Israeli news columnist suggest Pakistan could benefit a lot from recognizing Israel, particularly in terms of weapons tech. To which some Pakistani official sardonically replied why they would ever need Israeli tech when they literally raised their hands to the sky to pray and Allah would drop cruise missiles into their laps. He was referring to the Tomohawks that Clinton launched into Afghanistan during the late 90s to target Al-Qaeda positions but a few of which fell into the hands of Pakistani proxies in the Taliban and were promptly turned over to the Chinese for study and reverse engineering. This lead to the development of our Babur Cruise missile which bears a strange resemblance to the Tomohawk. This has been pretty standard procedure for Pakistan: Recover the technology, pass on to China, buy said technology at a discount from China once they figure out how to make it. Back in the 50s till 70s, the Middle East had the unique distinction of being a graveyard for high tech weapons but it seems the onus has shifted to the Af-Pak-Indo theater for a while now and made the region a hotspot for some advanced tech that seems to literally fall from the sky periodically and bolster the yield for our investments into high tech weapons smuggling. 8. Pakistan\u2019s armed proxies and their role in tech recovery.\u201cI send love and weapons to everyone possessed with night visions.\u201dApocrypha by Peter Gizzi Everything from Hellfire missile IR sensors to components of UAV drones have made their way from Pakistan to China and to Pakistani labs as well for analysis and decomposition. Pakistan\u2019s armed proxies in the field (aka certain Taliban factions) are critical to actually recovering some of this tech, extending the scope and reach of the network to rural areas which are too conflict prone to place actual assets in. And they are also critical to providing cover to the operations of some of those assets. Pakistan has long served as a supply route for NATO supplies to Afghanistan, and this has meant that some of the most valuable NATO tech supplies have had to pass through Pakistani ports and supply routes to reach the Afghan border. Now while containers could easily by \u2018misplaced\u2019 by some of the criminal networks that work the docks, this does not give enough cover to the intelligence apparatus to claim deniability if the US ever confronts them with the shipping manifests. So what they do instead is stage attacks on the border via Taliban proxies. The largest of these were the oil tanker blazes set by the Taliban but the more important ones were the theft of entire US helicopters like the Chinooks and the Black Hawk. The disappeared helicopters were reportedly dismantled and their parts carefully logged, collected and shipped to warehouses around the North West where as usual they were shared with the Chinese intelligence apparatus the Pakistanis work with. https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-41730 Similarly, more smaller and mobile forms of equipment like military laptops, night vision helmets and other pieces of hardware have long been hawked in KPK\u2019s \u201cNATO Bazaar\u201d where you can get NATO military gears from vendors selling vegetables on one side and NATO military sniper scope on the other side. The NATO bazaar used to mostly sell Russian and Soviet gear for a long time before NATO\u2019s entry into Afghanistan, so I guess this counts as a good example of the free markets adjusting themselves to supply and demand.Gunmen set NATO tankers ablaze in Pakistan 9. The International network is to make up for the intelligence apparatus\u2019s failings in other areas.What barbarian thought to make of thoughtless creatures weapons of war?Attack Underground by Sarah Lindsay So far this answer has sort of projected the Intelligence apparatus of Pakistan as almost infallible and omnipotent. Nothing could be further from the truth. With the exception of the Afghan Jihad (for which the ISI had considerable assistance from the Gulf Arabs and CIA), the ISI\u2019s historical record is mixed at best. The agency was unable to locate key Indian divisions during the 65 war, predict the outcome of the 1970 election, predict the foreign policy reactions to the 71 war or the Indian incursions across the LOC at Siachen and other key border posts. Counter intelligence and counter espionage have been even worse with the agency failing to prevent CIA assets from taking actual photos of Pakistani nuclear weapons, phone tapping by RAW of key military and diplomatic personnel and defections to the US from it\u2019s own Military Intelligence bureau. The ISI\u2019s only claim to fame so far, has been it\u2019s vast proliferation and technology smuggling networks. It is the only sphere where it has justified it\u2019s budget and proven its mettle. And thus, the agency has taken great care to keep this department up to par in order to compensate for failings in other fields.While several larger states like Russia and China operate their own networks of spies and intelligence assets globally, Pakistan is somewhat unique since Pakistan\u2019s network is extremely specialized in High tech weaponry. The Chinese have to diversify in order to steal civilian industrial secrets for their own companies as well. The Russians have elections and disinformation media campaigns to run on the side. But High tech weaponry is what gets all of Pakistan\u2019s resources as far as our international black market networks are concerned. Pakistan\u2019s domestic defense industry is still fairly nebulous and not as efficient as several other comparable industries. This is because the Defense production industry is closely wrapped up with the Military\u2019s economic interests and outside the scope of privatization. And since military men make terrible managers, the industry has lagged heavily in terms of efficiency, retaining top talent, innovating and mastering difficult technological concepts. So we end up with giant state organizations run by the military, employing retired military officers that are an immense burden on the tax payers, barely producing exports and doing the bare minimum of indigenous arms development. Only the nuclear and missile tech cycles are fairly well understood and indigenous but one needs to remember that missiles and nuclear tech is nearly 60\u201370 year old technology at this point. The Indians have done fairly better in this field thanks to better funding and smarter incorporation of the private sector into defense enterprises, resulting in more innovation and technical mastery than the government subsidized, slow moving behemoths with non-technical managers that we have on our end. China has been our saving grace in more advanced technology ventures like satellites, electronic warfare, drones, radars and stealth. Our vast defense production behemoths serve more as import/export clearing houses, some basic technological research and operations mostly. There\u2019s a running joke about this: Pakistani scientist 1: \u201cWho is the best, most innovative technological organization in Pakistan? KRL? NESCOM? NDC?\u201d Pakistani scientist 2: \u201cThe ISI ofcourse\u201d The high tech black market for weapons maintained by the intelligence services of the country, in a vast nexus spanning nearly 5 continents and integrating actors like North American drug dealers, the Taliban, Russian mobsters, Turkish smugglers, Ethnic Pakistani gangs and Arab money dealers has been the saving grace of many a strategic program and objective as far as Pakistan is concerned. At the core of Pakistan\u2019s defense policy is the knowledge that we cannot win a conventional war against India anymore: And our continuous survival must come from a mix mash of constant, tactical moves that match the fluid nature of our environment. Maintain a credible deterrent that ensures our survival. Use covert networks of proxies to project force and interests in the near neighborhood. Have enough economic and technological diversity to withstand sanction pressure and ecological degradation. Maintain a network of foreign alliances that will intervene on our behalf in the powerful international bodies and will lend weight to our negotiation credibility. Maintain enough a military capability to buy time for a diplomatic resolution to any outbreak of conflict. And of course *cough* keep the civies down and maintain the military\u2019s domestic interests *cough*. The covert international network of high technology smuggling and theft contributes to nearly every one of the above objectives. The network has been battered heavily by Gaddafi\u2019s leaking of it\u2019s assets to foreign powers, the AQ Khan scandal, the growing scrutiny of financial channels for terror financing which has reduced the space available for funding, growing scrutiny of Pakistan\u2019s intelligence activities and so on. And yet, the network has continued to produced surprisingly credible results despite the vast reduction in space available to it in the 21st century. The funny thing is, as technology progresses and the Russians, Chinese and Americans bolster their cyber defenses and high tech gadgetry to protect their secrets, more and more of the world begins to forget some of the old school ways of smuggling and theft that the Pakistani intelligence apparatus specializes in. And leaves them more exposed to outdated practices used by smaller, low tech networks that the Pakistani networks employ as they adapt more to high tech adversaries. While other powers maintain such networks, they do not specialize to the extent Pakistan has nor is their national survival as dependent on them as Pakistan\u2019s is. Which is why Pakistan has somewhat excelled in this dubious, nebulous, shadowy part of the world which others have either ignored or not been able to crack due to lack of desperate need for it. And yet, despite it\u2019s accomplishments, I have but an earnest desire for a Pakistan that needs no such grand enterprises to ensure it\u2019s survival. There is an untold tale of human suffering in all this that is hard to put into words. It\u2019s the price for existence, some tell us, we would be Libya or Iraq without all of this. But for me at least, I wish we were a normal enough country that we could just be known for our FIFA footballs and nothing else, in a quiet little corner of the world.Everybody in any room is a smuggler.

In the early 1960s, the 343,000-pound Lockheed C-141 Starlifter pioneered the 4-engine, high-wing, rear-loading layout that set the standards for the modern heavy lifter. It was not until more than seven years after the C-141 flew that the Soviets introduced the similar 374,785-pound Ilyushin IL-76. Meanwhile, Lockheed used its experience in building 285 Starlifters to produce the vastly scaled-up C-5 Galaxy. In addition to its 728,000-pound takeoff weight, the C-5 was remarkable for a top-hinged nose section and kneeling landing gear which eases loading. Vast trailing-edge slotted flaps interconnect with full-span leading-edge slats to reduce approach speeds for short-field operation, and spoilers improve braking. Fin-mounting of the horizontal stabilizer keeps it clear from the ferocious downwash of the flaps and provides clearance for ground vehicles using the rear-loading ramp. With four 43,0000-pound-thrust turbofans and an improved wing, the C-5B's maximum takeoff weight has been progressively boosted to 840,000 pounds. Once in the air, it can take on extra fuel from aerial tankers to increase its flying weight to 920,000 pounds.  Why do you relegate them to the past? These big airplane have several things in common: huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge wings, laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarge engines. But that is not all. They need special designs to be manageable on the ground, too. Let\u2019s take up the biggest of them all: The Mriya. There is nothing on Earth or in the air quite like the Antonov An-225. Although the An-225 seemed to emerge out of nowhere, her origins are actually not so mysterious. As in most areas of aeronautical innovation, except helicopters, the Soviets have followed the West's lead in designs for large transports. The Soviets were even slower in responding to the C-5 than they had been to the Starlifter. But as usual, they responded in a big way. The Antonov An-124\u2014later named Ruslan after Pushkin's fabled giant \u2014first flew Dec. 26, 1982. Except for its low-mounted horizontal stabilizer, the An-124 has been called a C-5 clone and is certainly remarkably similar in concept, size and configuration, although its maximum attainable payload is 63 percent larger by some measures. The 14-year gap from the C-5's debut allowed the Antonov design and engineering team under Pyotr Balabuyev to incorporate new technology. Carbon-fiber composites and light-weight materials comprise some 12,125 pounds, or 5 percent, of the An-124's empty weight, and save around 4410 pounds in structure. Proud as they were of their aircraft records, the Soviets were motivated by serious design purposes. Very large aircraft were required to lift outsize industrial loads into primitive airstrips in undeveloped areas of the U.S.S.R., not to mention military airlift missions. Thus, when even the mighty An-124 left certain needs unmet, work began on a still more massive air freighter. One key concern was the need to carry the cylindrical 150 x 26-ft. segments of the Soviet space program's Energia heavy-lift booster, which had to be carried externally. Such a load would subject the An-124's single vertical stabilizer to unacceptable levels of turbulence. In 1984, Balabuyev was assigned to produce a transport aircraft able to lift a 551,116-pound maximum external or internal payload and operate from any 11,500-ft. runway. This meant a 220,462-pound increase in maximum payload over the An-124. And the design staff had to produce the aircraft in record time. For a quick solution, the Antonov team decided on a 3-way stretch of its successful giant jet-freighter, the An-124. By inserting fore and aft fuselage plugs, which increased the overall length of the An-124 from 226.7 ft. to an astonishing 275.6 ft., the dream (Mriya, in the local Ukrainian dialect) gained substance. A new 49.2-ft. wing center section was designed to carry an extra pair of Lotarev D-18T turbofans. Dwarfing a Boeing 747 and out-lifting a U.S. Air Force C-5A Galaxy, Mriya can haul an expeditionary force into combat, or carry enough food to avert a famine. Yet, oddly, the original purpose of the An-225 was neither hostile nor humanitarian. Conceived in the chilliest years of the Cold War, the plane was designed as an airborne tow truck for the now-defunct Soviet space shuttle program.\u25b2At the 1989 Paris Air Show, this first appearance of the Soviet Union's Antonov An-225 Mriya aerial freighter, carrying the Buran space shuttle on its broad back, was an unforgettable sight THERE WAS no formal competition for top participant in the 1989 Paris Air Show. But if there had been one, the Russians would have won it hands down. The Soviets would have triumphed, ha only for the gobs of interesting flying machines and displays they brought to Paris, but also for the sheer showmanship they exhibited at this, the 38th running of the world's premier air show. The Russian revolution kicked off with the arrival of the 6-month-old, Antonov An-225 Mriya (Dream). Weighing in at 600 tons in maximum takeoff configuration, it is the world's largest and heaviest aircraft. The Dream arrived in Paris with a flourish. With its six 51,000-pound-thrust engines screaming and its caterpillar-like landing gear deployed, the huge aircraft made three circuits of Le Bourget punctuated by a window-rattling low pass over the flight line. On its back, it carried the space shuttle orbiter Baran (Snow Storm), the first time this particular piece of Soviet equipment has been put on public display. The first day's flight displays were captured by the Soviet's two fighter aircraft, the MiG-29Fulcrum, and the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker. The air work by these two flying machines was nothing short of spectacular. Tail-slides, hammerhead stalls, plus high alpha and rising knife-edge passes, kept the audience agog. Despite its lack of armaments, NATO war planners gave the An-225 a military code name, Cossack. History would reveal that the Soviet nickname for the An-225, Mriya, which is Ukrainian for \"dream,\" was more apt. In keeping with the Soviet penchant for building the world's biggest everything, the An-225 was designed to carry twice as much as a Boeing 747 freighter. The dimensions of the An-225 are staggering\u2014 nearly a football field from nose to tail and wingtip to wingtip. With a maximum takeoff weight of about 1.32 million pounds, it is 50 percent heavier than a fully loaded C-5A. To get so massive an aircraft into the sky, Ukrainian engineers equipped the An-225 with six ZMKB Progress Lotarev D-18T turbo-fan jets, each capable of pumping out 51,590 pounds of thrust. After only 31/4 years in development, Mriya took its maiden voyage on Dec. 21, 1988. Less than a year later the Berlin Wall fell, and with its collapse the Soviet Union dissolved. Ukraine, home to the Antonov Design Bureau that created the An-225, split away as an independent republic. And with these changes the future of the An-225 changed as well. Military Roots As revolutionary as it appears, the An-225 is a derived rather than original aircraft. Basically, it is an enlarged version of the Antonov An-124 military transport. Engineers stretched this smaller plane nearly 40 ft. and added two engines. To distribute the weight of the fully loaded, 6-engine aircraft, the An-225 was equipped with an unusually configured 32-wheel landing gear. Normally, only the nose gear of an aircraft is steerable. On the An-225 there are 20 steerable wheels: four in the nose gear and 16 at the rear of the 28-wheel main gear. The result is an aircraft that is extremely maneuverable. The An-225 boasts a payload of 551,150 pounds. What cannot fit inside can be put on its back. The An-225 boasts a payload of 551,150 pounds. What cannot fit inside can be put on its back. Objects large as 33 ft. in diameter and 230 ft.-long can be accommodated. Plus, it offers exceptional speed and range: The big jet cruises at nearly 500 mph and, fully loaded, it could fly nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. Immense loads like 80 automobiles, 16 standard ISO freight containers or general cargo up to 551,160 pounds can be handled with the help of four 11,000-pound-capacity overhead cranes running the entire length of the hold. \u201cBookings range from general cargo to items of over 200 tons and pieces that would only fit on the roof,\u201d says a spokesman for Air Foyle HeavyLift, the company that hopes to put the An-225 into regular service.The flying crane was the brainchild of Igor Sikorsky, the helicopter pioneer and founder of the company that bears his name. A test aircraft, the S-60, was built in 1959, and an improved version, the S-64, made its first flight in 1962. In his autobiography, The Winged-S, Sikorsky writes: \u201cCrane helicopters were first used as military aircraft in Vietnam. The S-64, with its powerful engines and its ability to carry loads of any shape and size, joined the 1st Cavalry Division (Air-mobile) of the U.S. Army in 1965. Four S-64s retrieved more than 100 aircraft in their first six months in Vietnam. They were also used to carry 155-mm artillery pieces\u2014some-thing no other helicopter could do\u2014bulldozers, fuel bags, radar equipment and other supplies. Pods, attached to the S-64's undercarriage, carried troops . . .\u201dAbout 100 Skycranes have been produced by Sikorsky, but most are in the hands of the military. To stimulate civilian sales, Sikorsky organized\u2014in the late '60s\u2014a company to handle a variety of contracting jobs. As a result, Sikorsky crews installed transmission towers at sites where top sections couldn't be placed by ground cranes; airlifted prefab sections of a restaurant to a mountain ski-lodge site; delivered pipe, cement, and other supplies to an oil rig in a South American jungle; and offloaded containerized cargo from a ship in the Arctic.",

Now, that\u2019s not enough to lift the plane directly, but when moving horizontally, it\u2019s enough to kick the plane up to high speeds. And the airflow across the wings at those speeds creates enough lift to raise the whole craft. The interesting thing about air pressure is that, if you have a big enough surface (which you do, on the wings of a large aircraft, even a small pressure difference between the bottom and the top is enough to create huge lift. Those engines provide the speed, which creates a pressure difference, which lifts the aircraft. Heavy as the plane is, it\u2019s big enough, with enough power, to do that.",

The mammoth 12-engined 170-passenger Dornier Do X flying-boat thundered over New York in the winter of 1931. The worldwide depression prevented more than three of these giant craft (including two for Italy) from being built. From the 1920s, requests for information on wing-loading and horsepower loading began coming in, these queries covering all sorts and conditions of airplanes. \u201cHow much wing area will be required for a plane weighing 2500 pounds,\u201d or again, \u201cHow much power will be required for propelling an 1800 pound ship at 125 m.p.h.,\u201d were typical examples of these questions. And as usual, these questions were not accompanied by a sufficient amount of data to make conventional calculations possible for they ignored the matter of wing-sections, type of body and many similar items concerned with engineering computations. After considering this matter for some time, it was decided by experts that answers to such queries could only be rough estimates at the best, and therefore, the best interests of all concerned would be served by employing empirical data obtained from existing standard airplanes. To further simplify the matter, it was decided to employ graphical charts for showing the relations rather than to enter into long calculations. And so, the editorial staff of Flying magazine compiled a considerable amount of data on a great number of standard airplanes, afterwards plotting out the figures on graphical charts. The curve, of course, represents the average values of standard practice in wing loading for the various well known airplanes that have appeared during the past year (1931).Each plane is represented on the graph by a dot, and because of the number of cases represented, the chart is literally peppered with these dots. Because of differences in the design, such as would be caused by the use of different wing-sections or of variations in the layout, there is often a considerable difference between the loadings of the ships at the same speed. In such cases, the curve represents the average or normal condition. Now let us examine Fig. 1, which shows the average wing loading for a monoplane in pounds per square foot at different speeds, ranging from zero to 400 miles per hour.The top speeds are scaled off on the lower horizontal edge while the loading per square foot is scaled off on the vertical edge of the chart. To use the chart, locate the desired top speed on the lower edge of the chart, follow up vertically to the curve, and then from the point of intersection, follow across horizontally to the scale of wing loadings. Here you will find a fair average value for the loading at that speed\u2014close enough for an estimate. For example, if our proposed plane is to have a top speed of 200 m.p.h., locate this speed, follow up to the curve and then across to the left where we will find the loading to be approximately 22 pounds per square foot of wing surface. Now, in these figures, all practical factors are included, such as changes in the angle of attack. Hence, it will not be necessary to perform any separate or additional figuring. It will be noted that the permissible loading on the wings increases very rapidly with the speed, but not so rapidly as in the case where the wing is held at a constant angle. In practice, the angle of attack is decreased when the speed is increased so that the lift does not increase as fast as the square of the speed as indicated by the formula in which (K) is a constant. For example, let us say that we wish to estimate, roughly, the wing area of a monoplane that is to have a top speed of 110 m.p.h. On examining the chart, we find that this speed corresponds to a loading of 10 pounds per square foot. If the monoplane weighs 2,500 pounds, fully loaded, then the wing area becomes: Area = 2500/10 = 250 square feet. This is simple enough, and will give us an idea of the actual area required. Then, when we get down to brass tacks, for the final design, and when we have decided on a wing-section, we can re-compute the area more exactly. But there is not likely to be much difference. It should also be noted that the graph is only true for monoplanes and that the figures are somewhat different for biplanes. It should also be noted that, being taken from practical machines, this data takes landing speeds into consideration so that the landing speeds are commensurate with the given top speeds. Wing loading has gradually crept up with the steadily increasing top speeds. The old Wright Model \"B\", was loaded approximately to 3.5 pounds per square foot with a top speed of about 45 m.p.h. During the war (WWI), the demand for higher speeds brought the loading up to about 16 pounds per square foot, while the Schneider Cup Supermarine racer with a top speed of over 400 m.p.h. was loaded to more than 40 pounds per square foot.\u25b2Racing plane of 1932 This chart is compiled from the wing loading and power loadings of ships in commercial production, and the figures have not been arrived at by theoretical considerations. Of course, this can only be approximate without knowing the nature of the wing sections and other data, but it is a fairly good guide for a preliminary estimate. And that\u2019s how it is (or was) done. The range of wing loadings in use is exceedingly wide. Man-powered airplanes are down in the vicinity of two pounds per square foot. The Piper Cub checked in at 9, the Cessna 172 at 13, the Beech Bonanza at around 19. Medium twins have wing loadings of around 30 pounds, business jets 40 to 60. Fighters like the almost-wingless Lockheed F-104 got up to 150, as did the North American X-15 rocket plane; but there's been a downward trend in recent years for the sake of maneuverability. Airliners get as high as 150.\u2751",

The soot is just carbon that eventually falls in rain, and is safer than most other things that fall in rain (like bacteria and natural silicate dust). The only other chemicals in the contrails are the decomposed remnants of gum-inhibitors, anti-static agents, corrosion inhibitors, and anti-icing agents, all added to some fuels at some times in extremely tiny quantities for the simple reason it takes extra fuel to carry every pound and so operators keep planes as light as possible.

Chemtrail conspiracy theorizing began about 1996, when the United States Air Force published a report about weather modification. This was in the early days of the Internet, and the report was picked up by a number of conspiracy theorizers like Richard Finke and William Thomas, and later popularized by conspiracy mongers like the late Art Bell. After a period of time, the report morphed into a conspiracy concerning the United States Air Force attempting to poison the population of America by spraying chemicals from airplanes. Angry letters and phone calls poured in to government agencies decrying the alleged conspiracy. In 2000, the EPA, FAA, NASA, and NOAA teamed up to publish fact sheets dispelling the chemtrail conspiracy theories. Rather than calm public fears, the fact of so many powerful government agencies working together to counteract the rumors was interpreted as a conspiracy itself, to fool the public into believing that the chemtrails were merely contrails (water condensation in the cold upper atmosphere, which is what they are and have always been).The USAF then released a fact sheet in 2005 stating that the conspiracy theories were a hoax fueled in part by citations in a 1996 strategy paper titled \u201cWeather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025.\u201d The paper was presented in response to a military directive to outline a future strategic weather modification system for the purpose of maintaining the United States' military dominance, and identified as \"fictional representations of future situations/scenarios.\" The USAF further clarified in 2005 that the paper \"does not reflect current military policy, practice, or capability,\" and that it is \"not conducting any weather modification experiments or programs and has no plans to do so in the future.\" To further muddy the waters, photographs of barrels installed in the passenger space of an aircraft for flight test purposes are claimed to show aerosol dispersion systems for the alleged chemicals in contrails. The real purpose of the barrels is to simulate the weight of passengers or cargo. The barrels are filled with water, and the water can be pumped from barrel to barrel in order to test different centers of gravity while the aircraft is in flight.And how to explain contrails produced by propeller planes during World War II, a full decade before jet aircraft became commercially available? Just how long has this \u201cconspiracy\u201d been in effect? For 75 years? contrails produced by World War II era propeller-driven military aircraft \u201cChemtrails\u201d are simply water vapor that condenses in the air behind the jet aircraft due to the fact that jet turbines push very hot air very quickly into the atmosphere. They are made of the same \u201cchemicals\u201d as clouds are - H2O (more commonly known as \u201cwater\u201d) that condenses out of the atmosphere and forms ice crystals - the same process by which you can \u201csee\u201d your breath on a cold winter day when you go outside. The persistence of any contrail depends on many factors: the altitude of the plane, the speed at which that plane is flying, the speed of the wind, the humidity of the air, and the barometric pressure of the air, to name just a few. I\u2019ve lived just a few miles from two of the busiest airports in the world, JFK International Airport and LaGuardia Airport, for the past 25 years. If there really were effects of alleged \u201cchemtrails,\u201d I\u2019d think we would have seen them by now. Oh, and what are those effects? Conspiracy mongers have no answer. Belief in chemtrails as a government conspiracy has more to do with individual psychology, personal feelings about the relationship of the citizen to the government, and the particular community in which one resides, which will or will not provide affirmation and repetitive validation of the belief. Generally, belief in chemtrails as a government conspiracy goes hand-in-hand with other false beliefs and conspiracy theories. So, take a perfectly simple and explicable natural phenomenon (contrails) that has been around as long as there have been high-flying aircraft, mix in a little paranoia of the government, add a dash of scientific ignorance and a dollop of fear for good measure, let the mixture simmer for a bit in a conspiracy incubator like the Internet, and voil\u00e0! - you have a conspiracy theory.",

Alright, let\u2019s just say abject paranoia is actually reality. What does science say about the rest? You\u2019re talking about dumping an aerosol into the free atmosphere at high altitude, and having that substance disperse over an area several hundred square miles. (Chempanzees don\u2019t know that wind drift at altitude can even carry rain, snow, sand, and hygroscopic nuclei across continents). Likely those particles will evaporate and never even reach the ground, but if they do, are we to assume the density and concentration of these particles are going to be sufficient to invade a person\u2019s central nervous system and cause them to tweak out? Nope\u2026 a potato bug wouldn\u2019t even notice. \u201cYeah, but they do it every day, and use multiple aircraft, dummy\u201d. You know, the Air Force and other branches have a training and operational budget to keep, and massing a domestic assault on innocent Americans (where\u2019s the Judge Advocate General again\u2026asleep?\u2026 ok) would pull those aircraft out of service. The USAF has about 1200 aircraft that are designated as tankers and cargo/transports. That\u2019s NOT very many aircraft. Every mission is planned, documented, and debriefed. They know where every single aircraft is, 24 hours a day. Every aircraft is accounted for in some way by at least a couple dozen people, whether it\u2019s the flight crew, crew chiefs, load masters, A&P mechanics, technicians, certifying bodies, or the upper brass. So now we assume that with all these people involved, surely whom are for the most part patriotic and conscientious men and women with families at home, we are able to pull the aircraft off the flight line, load them up with barium and other toxic metals, then go happy slappy crazy and f**k up our own people\u2026. AND NO ONE IS THE WISER. Hopefully, it was already answered here what a CONTRAIL is. It\u2019s a cloud that contains some burnt and un-burnt hydrocarbons in it. They are produced by not only the exhaust from a jet engine, but also (though not as noticeable) by the control surfaces of the aircraft as they deflect up/down/left/right and change the local temperature of the air just enough to cause the air flowing around them to condense and hence form a trailing contrail. Chempanzees of course aren\u2019t aware of this, they just think chemtrails come out the engines or from a chem-port somewhere. \u201cThen why don\u2019t I see ALL jets produce those all the time, you idiot?\u201d Indeed. Puffy white contrails are never a guarantee. Whether or not they form depend a lot on\u2026you know\u2026 scien-tif-tif-ic things. Like what the aircraft\u2019s velocity is, what the ambient air temperature outside is, what the relative humidity is, what the adiabatic lapse rate is, what the composition and stability of the atmosphere is today, and lest not least\u2026 the given altitude. If I could know for sure when I would be in favorable contrail conditions, I\u2019d have sky-written \u201cI love Julie\u201d or \u201cChempanzees are dorks\u201d numerous times already. To date, no such luck. What happens when you put barium and other toxic materials through a jet engine? It f***s them up, really badly. So now, in addition to spending the taxpayer\u2019s money to poison them, we also have to spend it on grounding all the aircraft and pulling the engines off, apart, and inspected with a micrometer. \u201cNot through the engines, it\u2019s held in special tanks, moron\u201d. Good point. And that means we have to install special holding tanks in the aircraft, re-calibrate the entire weight and balance data, put the aircraft through new flight testing and measure the new changes in performance, route plumbing ducts and electrical control assemblies, and inspect those on a progressive maintenance program. All while no one notices, of course. But wait, they do! The chempanzees with superior observational skills can\u2019t be fooled! In Robert Lee\u2019s own words, \u201cDo these people really think we are that stupid?\u201d Yes, Mr. Lee. Yes we do.",

I\u2019ve built experimental aircraft for the Ministry of Defence and was curious if a basic glider could have been made with those manufacturing technologies and materials they had to hand and were proficient using. The answer is yes they could have, one also needs to consider the account, I don\u2019t think a hand-launched model would warrant this story being kept alive in the oral tradition, a demonstration from a tower a possibility, a successful long-distance flight (at least for Daedulus) viable if Island hopping is used to obtain approximately 2kms of altitude to glide up to 50kms to the next island (assuming no headwind). The instrumentation needed is no more than a scarf on each handrail, if the target island is below it, you have sufficient altitude for the passage. We should not underestimate how sophisticated and good the Minoan understanding of hydrodynamics was (it's not modern but it is very good), hot (heated) and cold running water is present in the Queen's bathroom at Knossos palace, (venturi) injectors are used in interlocking claypipes to remove debris, the white ship hulls are hydrodynamic to slip through water with minimal resistance (one appears to use copper filings rather than limestone powder, to repel shellfish attaching to the hull), there is a lot of evidence that the Minoans built theoretical models (of the celestial bodies) and physical model of ships and buildings before attempting to scale up. They were very good and talented practical engineers and did undertake things in a methodical and surprisingly scientific way (magnetic declination is recorded in building orientation to Magnetic North from around 1800 BCE for example). One can debate if the fabled account of Icarus and Daedulus is true or what was actually demonstrated, we may never know. The Greek text although obviously lacks modern terms are hugely interesting to an aero engineer, the following is described:a) a cambered (lift-generating) wing,b) a tapered wing from the centreline (in planform) towards the tips, the feathers are used to describe that the wing is not straight but elliptical on the trailing edge, a complex shape like a bird is described, very specifically, this is Griffon Vultures (indigenous to Crete).c) constellations are unequivocally referring to angles to exclude a (flight) path from Orion (on the horizon) to the Great Bear (upwards), it is explaining a shallow glide path (slightly nose down), correct, Daedulus seems to understand that there is minimum glide angle! d) weight is balanced below the wing. This suggests an understanding of the principles of gliding flight. You would need to build at least a model to understand this. I\u2019ve included the text at the bottom and highlighted the sections which will be of interest to aero engineers. If you read the description carefully, the feather are not used to describe apparatus but a shape in plan (form), a Griffon Vulture\u2019s wing! The Minoans had technical skill in building very lightweight composite structures. Specifically, shields, which used a wooden frame, a wicker core to absorb impacts (balloon baskets still use this method as the material can withstand hard impacts on landing), and layers of leather bonded and stitched.We actually don\u2019t know very much about the Ancient usage of natural resins beyond incense and it is likely that there were other more technical applications, we know there was a trade in resins as they are found in shipwrecks, we don\u2019t really know what they were used for (but large quantities and a variety of different types are present). A team that reproduced this Theran half-scale Minoan white-hull ship shown below, used flax linen cloth over a wooden frame, with resin (a natural thermoplastic), fat (which I presume acts like a plasticizer, tree resins can be brittle) and limestone powders to make the white hull ship watertight, this has many advantages: hydrodynamic, completely sealing the hull and is used inside and out according to the fresco (if the ship is caught on rocks, the inner layer would delaminate but likely keep the hull watertight until landfall where a repair can be made). Ancient people (or at least the Minoans) may have been able to create complex composite structures using natural materials (possibly lost in the Bronze Age collapse, the ship Theseus returned in was kept in Athens as a prize for centuries until it decayed, no other civilisation could even reproduce these hulls, it is only the Minoans that use them or know how to make them! Flax is almost as strong in tension as glass fibre and very abrasion-resistant. The Minoans were brilliant at making things including textiles. They produced the finest weaves at this time, not just flax but sea-silk of gossamer fineness. The first aircraft used linen (called aerolinen) over a wooden frame and sealed using resin. The Minoans had all these very same materials and the very best craftspeople. I also note Icarus is accredited with inventing the sail. I don\u2019t think its the sail, this was known well before this, I think it more likely a seal to improve the longevity of the sail at sea or possible nets which are used to transfer loads to the mast under wind loading!This is a casting in Bronze from Samos, ca, 700 BCE (so likely a millennia after the mythical account). I used it as a model to create a wicker frame elliptical top wing (but elected to use a top fixed wing rather than the mid-wing shown), the wicker frame skinned with linen cloth and sealed, the pilot held using a leather harness but able to move about using the two wicker handrails (as shown). I used a wooden mannequin for weight shift and the legs are splade (using linen inbetween), the glider benefits from extended the control surfaces backwards with poles that could have been inserted into a sleeve in flight from the knee down, however, glides without (with less stability in flight). It is a simple elegant airframe, wingspan circa 6\u20137m. I should also add, competition hang gliders use this configuration as its technical better.The Minoans had all the same technologies the early flight pioneers such as Cayley had and arguably better craftspeople that were very proficient with using these manufacturing techniques and materials if we assume Daedulus is the master crafts person to Minos, then he has access to the Palace workshops which can make practically anything. They also have an advantage over the early tower jumpers, they had not heard the tale of their exploits which suggest feather were used! Which would be unlikely as they were proficient in creating sails. They more likely modelled the shapes and planforms on a Griffon Vulture which can be observed rising on the sunny side of a hill (using thermals), present on Crete.Daedalus plans his escape from King Minos of Crete Meanwhile Daedalus, hating Crete, and his long exile, and filled with a desire to stand on his native soil, was imprisoned by the waves. 'He may thwart our escape by land or sea' he said 'but the sky is surely open to us: we will go that way: Minos rules everything but he does not rule the heavens'. So saying he applied his thought to new invention and altered the natural order of things. He laid down lines of feathers, beginning with the smallest, following the shorter with longer ones, so that you might think they had grown like that, on a slant. In that way, long ago, the rustic pan-pipes were graduated, with lengthening reeds. Then he fastened them together with thread at the middle, and bees'-wax at the base, and, when he had arranged them, he flexed each one into a gentle curve, so that they imitated real bird's wings. His son, Icarus, stood next to him, and, not realising that he was handling things that would endanger him, caught laughingly at the down that blew in the passing breeze, and softened the yellow bees'-wax with his thumb, and, in his play, hindered his father's marvellous work. When he had put the last touches to what he had begun, the artificer balanced his own body between the two wings and hovered in the moving air. He instructed the boy as well, saying 'Let me warn you, Icarus, to take the middle way, in case the moisture weighs down your wings, if you fly too low, or if you go too high, the sun scorches them. Travel between the extremes. And I order you not to aim towards Bootes, the Herdsman, or Helice, the Great Bear, or towards the drawn sword of Orion: take the course I show you!' At the same time as he laid down the rules of flight, he fitted the newly created wings on the boy's shoulders [this is hugely important, it does not say attached flapping wings to the arms! It is a fixed wing and Icarus is holding its initial weight on the ground in his shoulders]. While he worked and issued his warnings the ageing man's cheeks were wet with tears: the father's hands trembled. Icarus and Daedalus fly away from Crete He gave a never to be repeated kiss to his son, and lifting upwards on his wings, flew ahead, anxious for his companion, like a bird, leading her fledglings out of a nest above, into the empty air. He urged the boy to follow, and showed him the dangerous art of flying, moving his own wings, and then looking back at his son. Some angler catching fish with a quivering rod, or a shepherd leaning on his crook, or a ploughman resting on the handles of his plough, saw them, perhaps, and stood there amazed, believing them to be gods able to travel the sky. And now Samos, sacred to Juno, lay ahead to the left (Delos and Paros were behind them), Lebinthos, and Calymne, rich in honey, to the right, when the boy began to delight in his daring flight, and abandoning his guide, drawn by desire for the heavens, soared higher. His nearness to the devouring sun softened the fragrant wax that held the wings: and the wax melted: he flailed with bare arms, but losing his oar-like wings, could not ride the air. Even as his mouth was crying his father's name, it vanished into the dark blue sea, the Icarian Sea, called after him. The unhappy father, now no longer a father, shouted 'Icarus, Icarus where are you? Which way should I be looking, to see you?' 'Icarus' he called again. Then he caught sight of the feathers on the waves, and cursed his inventions. He laid the body to rest, in a tomb, and the island was named Icaria after his buried child.",

The wings skinned with linen (the Minoans produced the finest textiles at the time). Linen held taught between splayed legs. It is a very simple airframe. You need some leather for a harness, that's all the materials needed! Icarus is accredited with creating the sail, I don\u2019t think it is the sail, it existed, it may be a coating for the sail to improve its longevity at sea. It is likely designed based upon the Griffon Vulture which can be seen circling on the sunny side of hills on Crete.Notes: wicker is used to this day for hot air balloon baskets with good reason, it is hugely resiliant to ground impact, it is very tough. It is wetted and can be woven into any shape. By example, I can pick up a two-seater wicker sofa with one hand, it's super light and was used at this time to make composite figure of eight shields.The changes I made from the bronze, were: a) a top wing (a mid-wing being shown), b) an elliptical wing in planform is naturally formed by the wicker. The mythical account although lacking the modern-day terms, is specific, it describes a tapered wing, with a straight (tapered) leading edge and an elliptical trailing edge, just like Griffon vultures in flight, see video. A chambered wing (lift generating) is also clearly articulated. The reference the feathers are associated with the shape of the wing, not necessarily employed on the airframe. The linen may have been sealed using beeswax or pine resin. Interestingly a reconstruction team that made a Minoan white-hull believed they used linen cloth over a wooden frame, that was wetted out with molten pine resin (using oil as a plasticizer) and impregnated with limestone powders to make it white, the reinforcement is shown inside and out on one hull in Theran \u2018flotilla\u2019 fresco, so the Minoans may well have had composites but strictly speaking they don\u2019t need them for a basic hang glider. Nor should we underestimate how good Minoan engineering actually was, the Pylos Combat Agate (seal) shows under high magnification (the Minoan had rock-crystal lenses) an arc requiring a dividing calliper accredited to Daedulus nephew and milling holes of ca 60 micron and tool placement of 15 micron. Daedulus is likely the master craftsman to the Minos and had access to all the palace workshops which are the best in the world at this time, they have the best metallurgist, woodworkers, weavers and leatherworkers, they have everything needed to build an airframe and there is evidence of the study of early hydrodynamics (venturi injectors are employed in interlocking clay pipes).Natural materials are actually very good, for example, flax linen is almost as strong in tension as glass fibre. The other thing which is identified in the account are constellations, this may initially seem odd, the significance of this is that it defines unambiguously an angle between the horizon (Orion) and northern constellations (straight up) to be specifically avoided, the craft must be pointed slightly nose down in pitch - this is correct for gliding flight. There is also guidance to avoid extremes. The account alludes to practical insight into flight performance of a glider! It is unclear if they produced a hand-launched model or a hang glider, however, I note there is lots of evidence to suggest Minoan built models before scaling up. I can\u2019t see a hand-launched model warranting the myth. I have built experimental aircraft for the Ministry of Defence. My gut feeling is they got something flying and to be clear a model using a wooden mannequin does glide, very well.",

Sky lanterns have been made for centuries in cultures around the world, to be launched for play or as part of long-established festivities. The name sky lantern is a translation of the Chinese name but they have also been referred to as sky candles or fire balloons . Several fires have been attributed to sky lanterns, with at least one 21st-century death caused. Sky lanterns have been made illegal in several countries such as Vietnam which has banned the production, sale, and release of sky lanterns throughout the country since 2009. Many areas of Asia do not permit sky lanterns because of widespread fire hazards as well as danger to livestock. Construction [ edit ] Making sky lanterns in Mexico A very large sky lantern in Bandarban, Bangladesh The general design is a thin paper shell, which may be from about 30 cm to a couple of metres across, with an opening at the bottom. The opening is usually about 10 to 30\u00a0cm wide (even for the largest shells), and is surrounded by a stiff collar that serves to suspend the flame source and to keep it away from the walls. When lit, the flame heats the air inside the lantern, thus lowering its density and causing the lantern to rise into the air. The sky lantern is only airborne for as long as the flame stays alight, after which the lantern sinks back to the ground. In China , Taiwan and Thailand , sky lanterns are traditionally made from oiled rice paper on a bamboo frame. The source of hot air may be a small candle or fuel cell composed of a waxy flammable material. In Brazil and Mexico sky lanterns were traditionally made of several patches of thin translucent paper (locally called \"silk paper\"), in various bright colors, glued together to make a multicolored polyhedral shell. A design that was fairly common was two pyramids joined by the base (a bipyramid , such as the octahedron ) sometimes with a cube or prism inserted in the middle. Only the smaller models had a full frame made of bamboo or thin wire; the slight overpressure of the hot air was sufficient to keep the larger ones inflated, and the frame was reduced to a wire loop around the bottom opening. The \"candle\" was usually a packet of paraffin or rosin tightly wrapped in cloth and bound with wire. History [ edit ] China is considered to have developed the first simple hot-air balloons. [1] According to the sinologist and historian of science Joseph Needham , the Chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_lanternThe Chinese also experimented with man lifting kites around this time. A man lifting balloon could be made from around the bronze age, they had flax linen cloth and natural resins to seal them (these resins are a little brittle but beeswax could be used as a plasticizer, they even had turpentine that can be used as a thinner). Making a gas tight balloon is surprisingly easy, it can be done with a cow\u2019s stomach, you just tie a knot at each end, easy, this could be done from the stone age. Or you can use the section from the appendix and overlap the panels to form a massive balloon, this is the same method used to store hydrogen on early airships:Flying Cow IntestinesIn World War I, the Germans used cow guts to construct their deadly Zeppelins.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/flying-cow-intestines/ https://www.popularmechanics.com/flight/airlines/a16637939/british-airship-r101-engineering/Putting a lighter-than-air gas in an envelope is not viable until the 17th century with the discovery of Hydrogen (and Methane). Helium is discovered two centuries later as its inert and difficult to get hold of. A lighter-than-air balloon could be produced with primitive tools and materials known in bronze age but its kind of cheating. A basic battery can be made to split water in hydrogen. You need a container, lemon juice (or brine), two metals say copper and silver wires and run them into another container with water, you collect the H2 from the cathode side. You could do this with materials from the Bronze Age, but the people of this time would not obviously know about these methods. People underestimate how good natural materials are, fine linen cloth is called aerolinen it was used to skin wings and it is as nearly as strong in tension as glass fibre.

You would think that that would be the safest place to park a car but no. These security guards were so busy chilling that they did not even notice someone steal a car. The thing is that I had a steering lock on. This means that the thieves cut through it, I assume, and the guards did not notice a thing. So I come out and no car. My friend\u2019s driver calls the police immediately and they show up in like two minutes. I think that shocked me more so than the car being stolen. I had always assumed that the Pakistani police was completely incompetent. They take my information and the make and model of my car. They radio some other policemen and then come back to talk to me. They tell me that they have told the nearby police check points to watch for the car. They give me a phone number and I go home. Two days later, I get a phone call from some random number. It\u2019s the motorway police. They think that they found my car. At this point, I am quite skeptical. Most people had told me that once cars are stolen in Pakistan, you never get them back.

He lets me know that he is taking the car to the police station near the cinema and that I can retrieve it from there. I go to the police station. Fill out some forms and get my car back. The Motorway Policeman who called me is also there. He tells me how lucky I am. Apparently the thieves noticed a police checkpoint up ahead and got scared. They parked the car under an underpass and ran away. The motorway police noticed a car in the same place that had not moved for over a day and decided to investigate. They asked the police and realized that it was stolen. He got my number from the station and gave me a call to confirm. The car was almost exactly as before it was stolen. The thieves had taken out the CNG kit and stolen it from the car. Other than that they just stole some weird things. Such as my AUX cable, my cheap headphones, a water bottle, the car mat on the driver seat (not all of them, just one) and a piece of cloth. To this day I believe that the thieves that stole my car had never done this before. My car was their first. Hence the lack of professionalism and weirdness.

I don\u2019t know much about motorcycle but I\u2019m sure they have modified something to increase the power. I called the police again. Me: \u201cYes it is my bike.\u201d Police: \u201cOk.

He went up to the house of his oldest sister, who is a Barangay Kagawad, a kind of district councillor, and they went to the nearest police post to report the theft. While they were making their statements, an elderly couple, who was waiting for something in the police station told them that they had seen a guy, who was know in the neighbourhood as a thief and gang member, but had never been caught and convicted, with a bike matching the description, heading westwards towards the rather lawless Muslim regions, probably to sell it there. The older sister called another brother, who is with the Philippine National Police. He is now based in Bukidnon, but used to be stationed in Lanao del Sur, Zamboanga and Misamis Occidental, the provinces the thief was going to. He called a few of his friends and suddenly more than 1000 police officers in several provinces were on the lookout for the thief (in the provinces with insurgencies, the police is paramilitary and operates checkpoints and roadblocks. They are wearing camouflage uniforms and are carrying M-16A1 rifles and M-60 machine guns. Effectively they are light infantry and look like South Vietnamese soldiers of the Vietnam war). So the thief ran into a checkpoint, where the police was looking for him. From what I have heard, there was a short chase involved and probably a beating after he got caught. A few month later he got tried. He tried to threaten at first, that his gang would take revenge (this is how he got away for many years, intimidating witnesses and victims), but his friends noted that this family was well connected to the police and the police are a bigger gang, so they did nothing. Later he started pleading that he had a wife and a young child and was needed to provide for them. The older sister told him not to worry, she would take care of the wife and child (knowing her, she probably did), but he was going to do time. She told him that he got a free haircut (they shaved his hair in prison), a nice set of new clothes (orange prison coveralls), free food and that he got a nice pale complexion (in the Philippines being pale is still the beauty ideal). He was sentenced to two years in prison.",

We finished the job, but just had a few things to do the morning after. Ended up leaving the keys in the garage and calling it a night. My friend goes home and so on. Little past 3 am ,my family heard a loud bang. The layout of my driveway makes it impossible to see what is happening at the very front from my house. But either way no one thought much of it, maybe a drunk driver crashed into the fence? (We live near a bar, so what else is there to expect). But we still decided to check it out. When we got outside I noticed a few things were \u201coff\u201d, simply going into the shed was enough to discover someone tried burning a hole through the floor, and after further investigation found out a lot of really expensive tools were stolen as well, some being relatively large, so not very hard to miss. Here is where the irony comes in: Me and my dad see the cracked fence, and a piece of a broken taillight, and for a whole hour were trying to drive around the neighborhood to see if anyone had a broken taillight. We also noticed based on the markings on the fence that the color of the car was red. It wasn\u2019t until an hour later when it hit me like a train that my friend\u2019s car was stolen. The guys ended up breaking through the door in the garage, and conveniently (or inconveniently for myself) finding the keys to his car. They loaded it up with our stuff and left. They ended up raiding a few more places the same day and continued to use the car for a little while until shortly after the police found one of the guys high off of heroin lying beside the car in a farm field surrounded by a lot of the stuff he stole. Sounds like a policeman\u2019s dream lol. Sure enough got the car back, with some little damage here and there, which was fixed up ASAP. Sadly majority of the expensive stuff they stole was never found, aside from a few little things. But hey, at least the car was found right?",

No doubt, with a defense budget almost 4 times of that of India they can buy latest technologies, do research and development, use it as soft power all over the world and maintain a much larger army and fulfill their larger dreams of being a global superpower and challenge the throne of USA. But, what happens if you get beaten by army of a nation whom you not even consider a regional superpower? That\u2019s what actually happened on night of Galwan clash. Chinese were bullying India by establishing tents and other temporary infrastructures in the Galwan valley. Indian army was advised to do mirror deployment and the standoff continued when various level talks were held between military officials of both nations. It was decided that Chinese will back off peacefully. During night CO of 16 Bihar regiment along with his team went on site to see whether the Chinese kept their words. But they didn\u2019t, he confronted them and the clash took place. colonel santosh babu was attacked mercilessly along with his team, they were clearly outnumbered and not ready for any such incident (No weapons were used). Colonel and 19 others succumbed to their injuries. The news (CO sahab is no more) broke out in the camp. Now if you belong to a military family (you would know) or if you know someone from military background, ask him/her \u201cwhat\u2019s the importance of a CO?\u201d In one sentence all i can say is CO is a fatherly figure to battalion. And they actually mean it. Soldiers of 16 Bihar regiment had nothing but anger in their eyes and revenge in their mind when some 50\u201360 soldiers including ghatak charged upon the Chinese with their war cry \u201cBajrang bali ki jai\u201d What happened in next 3\u20134 hours was unprecedented. They not only killed some 40\u201345 Chinese soldiers but broke their neck, Back, smashed their face beyond recognition, terrorized the enemy such that many jumped into the Galwan river to escape. what happened that night was something which is unheard of in modern military.You can have an idea about what PLA faced that night by reading this article.\u2018Post Galwan battle, Chinese soldiers were in a state of panic\u2019 - The Sunday Guardian Live Now imagine you are trying to be a global superpower both economically and militarily, you are challenging the current superpower on every front but are beaten mercilessly by a group of soldiers without any ammunition. you lost not only some 40\u201350 soldiers but the confidence and are now in a state of shock and are still not able to believe what you just saw that night. Will you ever be able to acknowledge that the enemy was more passionate, merciless and superior when it came to the actual fight?if you want to save your azz getting kicked by whole world including your own people who will question your leadership and planning skills, You better remain silent like the superpower China.

The water used to be thigh-deep past our bamboo gates - in the semi-gravel road of the village. And we kids were always in search of opportunities to wade in the muddy waters and have fun splashing around.Apparently that was also the peak season of planting rice crop. The farmers wished for rain but if the lady luck was too kind, there used to be heavy downpour -causing flood instead. Little did we understand the concerns or discussions among elders and villagers when they made assessment of the losses in their paddy fields.When I was like 4/5 years old, one morning in between eating my biscuits with milk, I uttered \u201cI wish it rains heavily tonight so that we can have more floods tomorrow!\u201d. Now my Grandmother was not happy - \u201cit is not a nice thing to wish, you silly. You should ask for forgiveness from the Water-Princess\u201d, she said. I was like what? Next I had to walk with a 1 rupee coin in the palm of my folded hands, stand in front of the receding flood water of the courtyard, explain the terrible wish I had made and ask for her forgiveness. Lastly, I was supposed to throw the coin in the water as far as I could and return, without turning back. This last part really disappointed me as I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the Water-Princess in case she appears from the muddy water to accept my offering. And as per my Grandmother, this offering was supposed to reverse my blatant wish !Vacation ended, and I forgot about the incident; until I repeated the same wish once or twice in subsequent years. And which kid wouldn\u2019t like to play in the water and sail paper-boats?As for me it has remained as a Nostalgia of my childhood. Since my Grandmother is no more, I only have these memories to ponder sometimes.(Photo courtesy- google)",

But from left to right, the cat is granting favorable times.In the United Kingdom it is commonly considered that a black cat crossing a person's path is a good omen.In some places it is said that \" If a black Cat crosses your path , Call your Mom and tell her to take a Bath\"Sailors would want a black cat on their ship because it would bring good luck.Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, in the hope that they would be able to use their influence to protect their husbands at sea.Egyptian households believed they could gain favor from Bastet by hosting black cats in their household.Pirates of the 18th century believed that a black cat would bring different kinds of luck. If a black cat walks towards someone, that person will have bad luck. If a black cat walks away from someone, then that person will have good luck.In the United Kingdom however, if a black cat walks towards someone, it is said to bring good fortune, but if it walks away, it takes the good luck with it.If a black cat walks onto a ship and then walks off it, the ship is doomed to sink on its next trip.There\u2019s a few for you!

All in all, it made for a really crappy summer. At school, most of the air conditioners were broken or didn\u2019t really cool the air very well, and I did want to pick up some credits during the summer to give myself an easier load when the fall semester started. I looked through the summer offerings, and saw that there was a program where I could earn 6 units in 3 weeks at a Comparative Justice program that would be held in Holland and England. The decision of what to do was so difficult - Shall I stay in DC in a hot classroom with a broken air conditioner, or should I, for the same price, spend 3 weeks in Europe? What to do, what to do? We were guests of the Dutch police in a small town called Zandvoort aan Zee in Holland, about 20 minutes out of Amsterdam, and one hour from Utrecht. The class was fantastic. One weekend, my friends and I wanted to get out of town, and decided we needed some Brussels sprouts and Belgian chocolate. We bought train tickets and headed over to Belgium and had an amazing time. We didn\u2019t go to Brussels, but ended up in Brugge. For those who aren\u2019t familiar with the town, it\u2019s all castles and flowers like Disneyland, but it\u2019s all real! We stayed in a 10th century castle, pigged out on chocolate, and saw everything. But too soon, we had to head back to Amsterdam, and back to our home base in Zandvoort. I bought tons of chocolate and battenburg lace to bring back for my family and friends, so much that I used up all my francs. (This was before the Euro.). Each time I changed money, I lost money, and although I had lots of Pounds Sterling and Guilders in my wallet, and I didn\u2019t want to change money again. My friends and I walked to the train station, and I figured I\u2019d just buy my train ticket with my credit card. My friends and I got in line, and they bought their tickets and I went to get mine. I ordered the ticket and took out my American Express Gold Card and my passport so the clerk could see the signatures matched, and it was a valid ID. When I handed the clerk my card my gold card, he yelled at me, \u201cWhat\u2019s this!?\u201d I responded, \u201cIt\u2019s my credit card.\u201d He flipped the card over and looked at my signature box on the back. I wrote \u201cAsk For Photo ID\u201d where my signature went. It was common practice in the US to do that in 1995, because people learned how to copy signatures, so it was a bad idea to sign your credit card. If your card was stolen, the thief had a great example of your signature to learn how to forge. He slid the receipt to me under the window, I signed my name and showed my signature on my passport. The clerk slammed his hand on the counter and said, \u201cThis does NOT match the signature on your card!\u201d I calmly said, \u201cI know, but I want you to see my signature on my official government ID and you can match my signature to my ID.\u201d (I used my passport as my ID while I was traveling.) One of my friends named Heather bounced up and down and shouted, \u201cYeah! What\u2019s the problem, Buddy?\u201d I really wished she didn\u2019t do that. The clerk said, \u201cThis credit card is stolen!\u201d I calmly said, \u201cNo it\u2019s not. Look at the name on it, look at my ID, and look at my signature. It\u2019s exactly the same as on my passport. It\u2019s all me.\u201d My friends started grumbling at the clerk, and I shushed them. The clerk said, \u201cThe signature does not match! So the card is stolen! You are a thief!\u201d Of course my signature isn\u2019t \u201cAsk For Photo ID\u201d as I wrote on my card. At that moment, Heather started jumping up and down, pointing at the clerk screaming, \u201cAnd you\u2019re an asshole!! You\u2019re an asshole!!\u201d I turned to her and firmly said, \u201cHeather, you\u2019re not helping me!\u201d That summer was particularly cool in Belgium, and I had badly sprained my ankle at The Hague - the sidewalks were made out of cobblestone, and my foot slipped on it and twisted just right. My ankle had swollen to double it\u2019s normal size, and had become terribly bruised. Because of that, I couldn\u2019t get my foot into normal shoes, but I could get my foot into my wore high top sneakers. I cinched them up pretty snugly so I could walk on my injured ankle. I wasn\u2019t going to let a sprained ankle ruin my European adventure. I expected warm weather so I only brought a huge sweatshirt to sleep in. The cool weather forced me to wear my sleeping sweatshirt during the day, as I didn\u2019t bring a sweater - I was a size medium, and this sweatshirt was a XXXL - it went down to my knees, and was from the University of Washington and had a huge UW on the front. While in Europe, I didn\u2019t want to look like the typical American slob, but there I was. Big sweatshirt, high top sneakers, and jeans\u2026 The clerk glared at me and asked how I got a gold card. I told him I have a job in America and good credit, American Express sent me an application. I worked as an account executive for several years and had good credit. The clerk looked at me incredulously and said, \u201cYou are not an American, you are an Indonesian prostitute trying to sneak into Amsterdam!\u201d The first thing that came out of my sarcastic mouth was, \u201cHow dare you call me Indonesian!\u201d By that time, the police showed up, and asked what was going on. The clerk yelled to the police what his version of the story and the police simply said, \u201cCome with us.\u201d And one grabbed my upper arm, and led me around the corner where they had a satellite station. They asked me what was going on, and I calmly explained my side and why I wrote \u201cAsk for photo ID\u201d on my card. They said it was a good idea, but I should have my picture on my credit card. At that time, that feature was not available in the US. One of the police officers grabbed my purse, opened it and said he was going to see what I have in it. I shrugged, because I didn\u2019t have anything to hide, so one item at a time, he started taking things out of it, and placed them on a desk that was beside where I was sitting. Finally, he pulled out my police ID badge, and looked at my picture and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I told him I was a there studying comparative justice, and I\u2019m in Europe as a guest of the Dutch police in Zandvoort. He was welcome to call De Kommisaris there, his name is Noe to ask about me, as he knows me very well. Suddenly, he started putting my things back into my purse, and said, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about this. He just wanted your card because American Express has a program here where he\u2019d get a reward of 50 Francs for turning in stolen cards. He just wants the money.\u201d I told them I would call American Express and make sure to tell them about this guy\u2019s scheme and insist he not get any reward. The officer said that was good, so I asked him to help me get my card back - it\u2019s the only credit card I ever use. He said he\u2019d try. The two officers walked me back into the train station, and two of my friends were sitting there crying, and the one with the big mouth was complaining that we would be late getting back to Amsterdam. I told her no one is stopping her from leaving. The officers spoke to the clerk and told him he needed to give me my card back. The clerk said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s stolen and I won\u2019t give it back.\u201d This guy and the police went back and forth a few times, and finally the officer looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. He won\u2019t give it back.\u201d What the hell kind of cop was he? I told him to not worry about it, I\u2019ll call American Express and get another one sent to my hotel. They then left, and it still left me with the issue of now not being able to buy my ticket with my credit card, because the clerk had it, and it actually was the only one I carried. There was NO WAY I\u2019d even consider using my debit card to buy my train ticket. My friend Jen by then was bawling her eyes out, saying she\u2019d never seen such blatant racism before. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m the victim, and I\u2019m not crying.\u201d In fact, I was furious about the whole thing. A Dutch lady came up to me, totally upset and said, \u201cI saw the whole thing, and this is terrible. I bought you a ticket back to Amsterdam, I can\u2019t believe this happened to you.\u201d I thanked her profusely, and was relieved to finally be back with my friends. I offered the lady Guilders, to repay her, explaining that I only used my credit card so I wouldn\u2019t have to exchange money, but I had plenty of cash for other European countries. She said she felt better just paying for my ticket, it would make her feel better. I calmed my friends down, and we finally boarded our train and headed back to Amsterdam. When I got back, I immediately called the American Express office, told them what happened, and they assured me that they would not give any award for my stolen credit card to anyone. By the next morning, my replacement card arrived at the hotel. I opened the envelope to look at the card to make sure everything was correct on it, and much to my amusement, everything written on it was in Dutch.",

The first day and evening went well, and Arlene was delighted to have this rare glimpse into how the very wealthy live. The husband\u2019s employer was quite generous as a host, and took them to the finest restaurants. Arlene knew she would never have the opportunity to indulge in this kind of extravagance again, so she as enjoying herself immensely. As the three of them were about to enter an exclusive restaurant that evening, the boss was walking slightly ahead of Arlene and her husband. He stopped suddenly, looking down on the pavement for a long, silent moment. Arlene wondered if she was supposed to pass him. There was nothing on the ground except a single darkened penny that someone had dropped, and a few cigarette butts. Still silent, the man reached down and picked up the penny. He held it up and smiled, then put it in his pocket as if he had found a great treasure. How absurd! What need did this man have for a single penny? Why would he even take the time to stop and pick it up? Throughout dinner, the entire scene nagged at her. Finally, she could stand it no longer. She causally mentioned that her daughter once had a coin collection, and asked if the penny he had found had been of some value. A smile crept across the man\u2019s face as he reached into his pocket for the penny and held it out for her to see. She had seen many pennies before! What was the point of this? \u201cLook at it.\u201d He said. \u201cRead what it says\u201d She read the words \u201cUnited States of America.\u201d \u201cNo, not that; read further.\u201d \u201cOne cent?\u201d \u201cNo, keep reading.\u201d \u201cIn God we Trust?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cAnd?\u201d \u201cAnd if I trust in God, the name of God is holy, even on a coin. Whenever I find a coin I see that inscription. It is written on every single United States coin, but we never seem to notice it! God drops a message right in front of me telling me to trust Him? Who am I to pass it by? When I see a coin, I pray, I stop to see if my trust IS in God at that moment. I pick the coin up as a response to God; that I do trust in Him. For a short time, at least, I cherish it as if it were gold. I think it is God\u2019s way of starting a conversation with me. God is patient and pennies are plentiful! When I was out shopping today, I found a penny on the sidewalk. I stopped and picked it up, and realized that I had been worrying and fretting in my mind about things I cannot change. I read the words, \u201cIn God We Trust,\u201d and had to laugh. Yes, God, I get the message. It seems that I have been finding an inordinate number of pennies in the last few months, but then, pennies are plentiful! And God is patient... Source unknown.",

I had many theories on why or why they didn\u2019t pick it up. The economy must be good if they don't pick it up. The economy must be bad if they do or perhaps they still perceive there is value laying on the ground.Finally, I am a metal detectorist.

My ex wife had an affair after 18 yrs of marriage. The affair resulted in a pregnancy. Some of you who have read my other answers may already know this story so forgive me if I am repeating myself.  When the child was born I was faced with a choice. How was I going to treat this child. Her name is Amber so going forward I will use her name. My ex and I had 2 children who I raised after the divorce. They were 7 and 12 at the time. Suddenly they had a sister. The first thing I did was tell my kids that Amber was their sister not their half sister. Halves don't  exist in my opinion. She either was or wasn't. Then the question of how I would treat her. Should I ignore her?  Should I blame her and hate her?  Should I accept her but keep distance emotionally from her?  Should I not only accept her but embrace her?  It took a minute for me to compare my options.  I have always said that children are innocent and cannot be blamed for the actions of adults but could I stand by this conviction now that I was faced with it? Long story made a little shorter as I won't bore you with the details of the last 10 years.  Today Amber is my Princess. We are separated by half a country but I talk to her at least once a week, sometimes more. When she was 8 we only lived 40 miles from each other and I would drive down to her school to have lunch with her. Her mother allowed this. I love Amber as if she was my own child.  My Dad and Siblings cannot believe that I established this relationship with the product of my ex-wife's infidelity. I try to explain that Amber is not the cause of anything. She is innocent of the actions that her mother made.  She is a special girl, beautiful intelligent, funny and full of smiles. She is my Princess regardless of what my family thinks."

The Persian name of Kritika, the constellation of the Sun, is Suraiya. There are many stars in this constellation. Its enjoyment time in a day is one hour. Surya has an important place among the deities of Rigveda. Yajurveda has considered the Sun as the eye of God by saying \"Chaksho Suryo Jaya\". In the ChandogyapanJaya, the Sun has been described as Pranava and the benefit of having a son is given by his meditation. The Brahmavairvata Purana considers the sun to be a divine form. The famous Gayatri Mantra is Surya Prak. In Surya Upanishad, the Sun has been depicted as the only reason for the origin of the whole world. And he is described as the soul and Brahman of the whole world. According to the Shruti of Suryopanishad, the whole world is created and maintained by the Sun. The Sun is the soul of the entire universe. Therefore, it is not surprising that since the Vedic period, sun worship has been practised in India. Earlier practised worship was done with mantras. Later on, idol worship became popular, and sun temples were built everywhere. In the Bhavishya Purana, the importance of sun worship and temple construction has been explained in a dialogue between Lord Brahma & Vishnu. This story is also found in many Puranas that due to the curse of sage Durvasa, Shri Krishna's son Samba, who was suffering from leprosy, got rid of this terrible disease by worshipping the sun. In the ancient time of worshipping, many temples of Lord Surya were built in India. Some of them are world-famous today. Not only world-famous literature but in Ayurveda, astrology, palmistry, the importance of the Sun has been propounded. The now when according to astrology, when your Sun will be good, when will it give auspicious results - Surya gives fruit like Sanjeevani. The Sun is your soul. That is why, while considering the horoscope, the astrologers consider the Sun first. Sun place becomes strong in the east direction. It is ruled by the 5th zodiac sign of the zodiac belt i.e. Leo. Therefore, Sun in Leo becomes self-occupied. When it is 10 degrees in Aries, it becomes of supreme exaltation. That is, it becomes very auspicious after reaching a very good condition. On the other hand, the Sun of 10 degrees in Libra is considered to be debilitated. In addition, the According to the constellation, in Aries, it is the first phase of Krittika Nakshatra, 2,3,4 phases in Taurus, the first phase of Uttara Phalguni in Leo, 2,3,4 phases in Virgo and the first phase of Uttarashada in Sagittarius and It dominates the 2,3,4 phase of Uttarashada in Capricorn. The distance of different planets from the Sun tells how the Sun will have a favourable effect on the person. Also, in which zodiac the Sun is, whether it is its weak zodiac, exalted zodiac, self-occupied, friend or enemy, all this is taken into account by an astrologer making predictions in astrology. Numerology is also an important discipline in astrology. By which we can answer the questioner in a short time. In numerology, the sun has got the number of \"1\". If your date of birth is 1,10,19,28, then your Bhagyank number will be considered as Sun's number \"1\". Apart from this, your karmic number will be the date of birth, month, and full Whatever will be obtained after adding Sun, as well as when we bring out the total number alone, and that number comes to one, then it will be considered as Karmic number only. According to the date of birth, the names of people whose name comes with the number \"1\" are mostly B, M, T, and D. Number 1 is the starting number, without it no digit can be started. The person with this number is self-respecting, he has the habit of listening only for himself. There is also honesty in the native, and he is never ready to bow down in front of anyone. He does not want to be subordinate to anyone and wants to keep everyone under himself. If the person with number 1 works under his number i.e. in the dates of his number, he goes on getting success. The person is a very bright, virtuous scholar, generous nature, kind, and full of self-confidence in morale. He does his work automatically, he does not know how to work by relying on someone. He is dedicated to a government job and government work. He makes to himself a skilled administrator in a short period. There are also some evils in a sun-ruled people if the sun is under malefic effect. Such pride, greed, indecision, laziness, external press, haste, arrogance, etc., are full of bad presence in his life. Due to these defects, one is not able to develop properly. At the same time, due to not being able to recognize his enemies, he keeps taking trouble with them. The habit of interfering in every work is also in the person. It is very difficult to describe in words the glory of Lord Surya. Science also considers the importance of sunlight in the overall development of human beings. Sun is the main representative star of the solar system, hence its importance is also highest in astrology. The rays of the sun leave their deep impact on all living beings including humans. The fate of a human being is greatly affected by these rays. If the position of the Sun is weak at the time of birth of a person, then his fate remains erratic throughout his life. The presence of the Sun in the inauspicious house takes away prestige, glory, property the etc. In such a situation, proper astrological measures should be used so that success in life can be achieved by increasing the positive effect of the Sun. Sun in palmistry-- The effect in the life of any person can be ascertained by looking at the Sun Mount in the root of the ring finger in the palm and the lines drawn on it. The lines formed on the mount of the Sun are called Surya Rekha or Sunline. The result of the state government job of the person is told only when the ring finger is longer than the index finger. When there is an elevated mountain and there is a subtle round point in the middle of the mountain, when the mountain is pink in colour, the prestige post is said. On the rise of the marriage line under the fade colour mountain, information about marriage breakdown and immoral relations is obtained due to politics in marriage. Effect of Sun's conjunction with various planets on the horoscope The rays emanating from the Sun directly or indirectly illuminate other planets. Therefore, the effect of the planet Sun is said to be important in astrology. According to astrology, Sun means soul and Moon means mind. Know how it brings auspicious or inauspicious results for you when the Sun is in conjunction with different planets in your horoscope. Sun and Moon conjunction Talking about the Sun and the Moon from the point of view of astrology, the Sun-Moon conjunction makes the person determined. Here the Moon increases the factor of the Sun. Sun and Mars conjunction If Sun and Mars i.e. soul and courage are together, then according to Vedic astrology, Angarak Dosh is formed. Such people are very angry type. They are hasty in any decision, due to which they often take an axe on their leg & Get in trouble. Sun and Mercury conjunction If we consider the conjunction Sun and Mercury, then the coordination of Sun (soul) and Mercury (intellect) shows the unity of inner intelligence and outer intelligence to the native. The people with such a combination of planets are very firm in taking decisions. Both father and son have good d educational qualification. Native is respected in society. Sun and Jupiter conjunction If Sun and Jupiter are together in the house then very good spiritual yoga is formed. In the Vedas, the sun is called the soul and the guru is the inner intelligence. The conjunction of Sun and Guru leads the person towards religion and spirituality. The negative side of this combination is only that it makes the person stubborn. Sun and Venus conjunction What to say if Sun and Venus come together in the horoscope! Venus is the ecstasy of life, so the Sun gives it energy. A person with such qualities in the horoscope royally lives his life. However, the feeling of estrangement and dissatisfaction royally lives in native's life throughout. If the person is not able to control his desires, then he keeps on wasting money on things by becoming luxuriant, beauty-loving and woman-loving. Sun and Saturn conjunction If there is a conjunction of Sun and Saturn, that is, if Sun and Saturn sit together in the horoscope, then they create a cursed flaw. For most of the life of such a person, a conflict situation arises. The interesting most of that according to the Puranas, Sun and Shani are enemies of each other even though there is a father-son relationship. In this way, the possibility of increasing enmity and resentment between father and son increases. Differences and dissatisfaction arise with the senior officers of the employed people.",

The degree of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness will depend on the full analysis of the horoscope (birth-chart).Nidhi Astro | Top Vedic Astrologer \u00b7 1yAs per Vedic astrology which planet has the most benefic impact?In Vedic astrology, there are 9 planets, each of which represents certain energies, from which karma and this entire material world are intertwined. All these planets have the qualities of malefic or benefic planets: some harm and cause disorder, others, on the contrary, bring prosperity and good luck. The energies of some planets are friendly to us, while others are destructive. So, to determine an evil planet or a good one, it is important to understand that the nature of the planet is divided into two types: natural and functional. The natural nature of the planets Natural nature is the universal quality of the planet, relevant for any horoscope and any circumstances. Natural benefactors are by nature benevolent, just as natural malefactors are by default realizing their destructive nature. Natural benefactors, whose default nature is kind, friendly, and beneficent: Jupiter - represents wisdom, conscience, morality, abundance, generosity, kindness and optimism. Venus - love, tact, diplomacy, beauty, creativity. Growing, bright, full Moon - emotionality, warmth, care. Natural malefic, in the settings of which destructive functions are prescribed: The Sun is ego, pride, cruelty. (However, the damaging functions of the Sun are still most amenable to our awareness, because this planet is in sattva-guna, in goodness) Mars - anger, war, strife, confrontation, fire. Saturn - depression, old age, illness, hard work, restrictions and delays. Rahu and Ketu - lies, affect, loss of control, temptations, seductions, fears. Waning, dark Moon - emotional instability, coldness, cruelty, phobias. Mercury is the most adaptive planet, its basic qualities are beneficent, but if it is affected by pests, then it mimics under them and takes on a malevolent nature. The listed qualities of the planets are basic, default. However, to conclude their influence, it is important to evaluate the horoscope for its functional nature. Since in some horoscopes, the natural malefic Saturn and Mars bring prosperity, and Venus and Jupiter can be a harbinger of difficulties. The functional nature of the planets The functional nature of the planet varies from horoscope to horoscope. In one horoscope, a natural malefic turns into a benefactor, and in another, it can show its destructive power in all its glory. The functional nature of the planet DOES NOT DEPEND on whether the planets in the chart are strong or weak - this is an important point. If a planet is in a strong position in your chart, this does not mean that it is good. And vice versa. The functional characteristics of the planet depend on which house the planet rules. When a planet rules the - 1st, 5th and 9th houses - it becomes functionally beneficial for that horoscope. This characteristic is dominant if the planet also rules the \"bad\" house. The ruling of the Kendra - 4th, 7th and 10th houses - makes the planet functionally neutral, but there are nuances here. If a planet rules two Kendra houses and is naturally benefic, then it turns into a malefic (as happens with Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius and Pisces ascendant). If a planet rules the house of trikona and the house of Kendra, it acquires a special status of yoga karaka - the most favourable planet in the horoscope. When a planet rules the 3rd, 6th and 11th houses, it becomes malefic and destructive to the horoscope. If a planet rules the 2nd, 8th or 12th house, its functionality depends on which second house it rules or which planets it is connected to. About the 2nd and 7th houses, it should be said separately that the planet that controls such a house turns into a maraka - the planet of death, therefore, although it is neutral, it is more with an unfavourable connotation. Since the ruling of planets by houses depends on the ascending sign, the list of beneficent and malefic planets for each Lagna is the same, I disclosed it at the end of the post. How to use this information Benefic planets strengthen the house in which they are located in the horoscope, bring positive events in the sphere of this house. With malefic planets - on the contrary. It is good when favourable planets are in the houses of trikona (1,5,9) or kendras (1, 4, 7, 10), and malefic in the houses of upachai (3, 6, 11) - this gives support to the entire horoscope and indicates favourable karma, luck, the general level of well-being.  How to evaluate the planet, if it is, let's say, naturally beneficial, but functionally unfavourable? For example, if Jupiter rules the 6th and 3rd houses (with the ascendant in Libra). The functional characteristics of the planet will prevail, but the beneficent nature will also partly be felt. Often the functional nature is more manifested at the objective and event-level, and the natural nature at the level of personal qualities and inner experience. For example, the same Jupiter for Libra, which is located in the 1st house, can give weakened immunity, a lot of struggle, obstacles in life, overcoming, but at the same time reward with wisdom, kindness, generosity, and pedagogical talent. Also, the functional nature is extremely important to consider when evaluating periods. The period of even a well-located functional pest can bring difficulties, especially in the area of the house in which it is located. The functional nature is important to consider when we are working with the strengthening of the planet (not to be confused with harmonization), for example, through stones and minerals. You can only strengthen functional benefactors, and exclude the wearing of stones of malefic planets, no matter how they are located in the chart. So Sagittarius should avoid Venus stones because they can attract conflicts, illnesses, debts. The functional nature of the planets for each Ascendant: Aries Benefactors: Mars, Sun, Jupiter. Malefics: Saturn, Mercury, Venus. Neutral: Moon. Taurus Benefactors: Venus, Mercury. Yogakaraka: Saturn. Malefics: Moon, Jupiter. Neutrals: Sun, Mars. Gemini Benefactors: Mercury, Venus, Saturn. Malefics: Sun, Mars, Jupiter. Neutral: Moon. Cancer Benefactors: Moon, Jupiter. Yogakaraka: Mars. Malefics: Venus, Mercury, Saturn. Neutral: Sun. Leo Benefactors: Sun, Jupiter. Yogakaraka: Mars.

The Sun has a bad time in the 6th, 7th, and 10th houses. The Sun's friendly planets are the Moon, Jupiter, and Mars, while Saturn, Venus are foes..

Planet Sun is the most influential and authoritative planet in Vedic astrology since it is at the centre of the solar system. In astrology, the planet Sun generally represents power, position, and authority. When the Sun is placed in Houses 1 to 5,8,9,11, and 12, it produces positive results. The Sun has a bad time in the 6th, 7th, and 10th houses. The Sun's friendly planets are the Moon, Jupiter, and Mars, while Saturn, Venus are foes.. However, today we will see the result of the Sun in all 12 houses. Sun in 1st house An individual with the Sun in the first house always wants to be in the centre of matters. Sun in the first house denotes a dynamic personality, brilliance, and authority. One may be a strong-willed individual with excellent leadership abilities. A person with a solid moral character, right-minded nature, ambition, and a desire for power might be a show-stealer. The native is upbeat and verdant. If the Sun is afflicted, however, the outcomes will change. These individuals stand a better chance in politics. They are unable to work as subordinates and need their own space. Because of their success, and stance, people with the Sun in the first house are egoistic. Sun in 2nd House The Sun in the 2nd House also brings vanity, overconfidence, and other issues that can turn people against the native. Due to an ego issue, the Sun in the 2nd house may cause issues with family members. The second house represents wealth, and the person will devote the majority of his or her efforts to accumulating personal wealth and financial security. Sun in 3rd House The Sun is in his friend Mars' house that is in the third house. The 3rd house is the house of communication, so a benefic Sun here might indicate brilliant and effective communication. Their mark will be communication. Native will only speak when it is necessary and when it adds value. Having the benefic Sun in the 3rd house also makes the person brave, as they are not afraid to take risks. Sun in 4th house The 4th home is ruled by the Moon, who is Sun's friend. However, the Sun is a very hot and violent planet, and it is malefic to be in a place like the 4th house, which is associated with peace, home, and happiness, unless the sign is Leo or Aries. Malefic planets are not good for the 4th House because they wreak havoc on its affairs, particularly if Saturn, Mars, or Rahu are aspecting the Sun in the 4th House.Sun in 5th House Sun in the 5th House is not a bad placement. If it is beneficial, it makes the person wealthy, creative, and inclined to the performing arts such as dancing, acting, singing, and writing; whether it is sports or drama. The Sun is the 5th House have made many great actors, politicians, musicians, and athletes who have become popular among the masses. Sun in 6th house Overall, the 6th House is not bad if it is well-positioned. Both Sun and Saturn are malefic planets, and the 6th House is a malefic house, so two negatives equal a positive. Native is mostly in good health, has defeated his foes, and is self-assured. Affliction can cause heart problems, lower back pain, and even prolong sickness. It can also put him in debt or make him sick, making him unpopular with colleagues. Sun in 7th House The Sun in the 7th Home is in the house of his arch-enemy Venus, making it unsuitable for dealing with matters of friendship, partnership, legal cases, and contracts in the 7th House. Sun aspects the ascendant from here, which is beneficial if the Sun is not afflicted. It improves the native's health, trust, and ability to deal with life's challenges. Sun in 8th House Sun is in the 8th House, which is ruled by his arch-enemy Saturn, but it is also ruled by Sun's friend Mars. On the one hand, the eighth house is the house of death and destruction, but it is also the house of secrets, occult Knowledge, longevity, and In-Laws. Sun in 9th House The Sun in the 9th house is in Jupiter's house, which is his acquaintance. If there are no serious afflictions, the Sun does well in the 9th House. Spirituality, higher understanding, mysticism, and long-distance travels are all aspects of the Sun in the 9th House. Native would be a responsible son who values his ancestors. He'll be hungry to learn about different people, cultures, foreign lands, and languages. Sun in 10th House As long as the Sun is strong, the Career House (10th House) may be the best place for it. In the 10th House of Career and Reputation, the Sun is virtually at home. If the Sun is strong, the native has a good chance of becoming a great King, Politician, Administrator, CEO, Managing Director, Manager, or other top-level position. There are also excellent chances of government service and a career in agriculture and farming if the Sun is strong. Sun in 11th House The Sun in the 11th House is in Jupiter's House, which is his acquaintance. In astrology, the 11th house signifies gain or revenue. It indicates whether your ambitions for higher education, industry, litigation, employment, or speculation will be realised in this home. This is also where your friends live, and the quality of your social circle or friend circle can be judged from here. Sun in 12th House The Sun is in Saturn's mansion, his arch-enemy. The Sun will assist the native in realising his life's purpose and attaining spiritual enlightenment. Spirituality, on the other hand, would come at the expense of family life, potentially leading to divorce.",

Few of these planets are promising and some cruel planets due to their pursuits. Origin Of Planets According To Astronomy According to the Big Bang Theory in astronomy, it is believed that the universe was created by a great explosion. According to this theory, about 14 billion years ago, the entire universe was in the form of a unit in which a terrible explosion occurred and due to this great explosion, the entire universe was filled with helium and hydrogen, and other gases. After a long period, the planets and stars of the Akash Gangas were born in space. In astronomy, it has been called the theory of the Great Blast. According to astronomy, the planets began to revolve around the Sun as its center. Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn come first in the ascending order of the planet's distance from the Sun. Of these, only Earth is a planet that has life. Due to the high amount of water, it is also called the blue planet. Importance Of Planets In Astrology Whereas the information of zodiac is obtained from the birth chart of the native and the position of the planet and constellation is known from the horoscope. Therefore, according to Hindu astrology, the impact of planets immediately affects the life of an individual. It can be understood nicely from that someone's birth chart. In astrology, the Navagraha has 12 factors. While Mercury is a neutral planet, that is, it gives an inauspicious effect when it is with inauspicious and auspicious results when it is with an auspicious planet. The Moon is in both the auspicious and inauspicious planets. Although it is considered an auspicious planet only when it is weak, while weak it gives the same results as the cruel planet. All astrological calculations are possible mainly by it. What Are Planets All kinds of creatures and humans living on planet Earth influence their existence. According to astronomy, the planets are bound at a certain distance from each other by the force of gravity in the solar system and they are orbiting the Sun. For example, the speed of the moon is the fastest, so the duration of the moon's movement is the shortest. Similarly, the speed of Saturn is the slowest and during transit, it takes about two and a half years to move from one zodiac to another. When the planets in an individual's horoscope are weak or are enduring from the sight or combination of an adversary planet, then that person has to face illnesses and problems related to those planets and these troubles have to be suffered by the individual till that their concrete remedies should not be taken by changing habits in day to day life and performing some astrological rituals like chanting or listening mantras. Through this information, we will know the disorders and deformities related to different planets and astrological criteria for their deterrence. Sun The Sun planet is the emperor of all the planets. This is the factor of self, father, governor, high permission, etc. But if the Sun planet is unstable in the horoscope, then the individual has to face various types of problems and physical diseases. Due to the inauspicious consequences of the Sun, heart disorder, eye disorder, loss of money, and false indictments, and admiration is lessened. Remedy- Offer water to the sun at sunrise on everyday and donating red items to a poor person reduces the inauspicious impacts of the sun.Moon The moon planet is a symbol of calmness and beauty. This entity is a component of substance, coldness, mother, and sense. Where the individual is mentally strong or not is determined when the Moon is prominent in the horoscope. At the same time, due to its complication, a person has to face crises like mental stress, anxiety, lung disorders, and lack of fortune. Remedy- To reduce the inauspicious consequences of the moon, give milk to needy, curd, rice, white blooms, white sandalwood, and camphor to the moon. Mars Mars signifies excitement and energy. It is a factor of land, corps, police, athletics, blood, red color, etc. Due to Mars, Manglik Dosh or Mangal Dosh is constructed in the horoscope. If Mars is inauspicious, heart disorder, debt problems, and land property conflicts arise. Remedy- To lessen the inauspicious impacts of Mars, donate red cloth. Mercury Mercury holds the importance of the crown prince among the planets. Although the essence of the planet Mercury is neutral. This neither a reasonable planet nor the inauspicious planet. But with favorable planets, it provides favorable results, and with inauspicious planets gives inauspicious outcomes. Due to the inauspiciousness of Mercury in the kundali, skin illnesses arise and disorders occur in the family. Remedy- To reduce the consequence of Mercury, donate green stuff. Jupiter Devguru Jupiter is a favorable planet. It is a factor of understanding, guru, kids, wedding, money, etc. With the promising effects, a person is informed, academic. While it is inauspicious, he begins undergoing his son. Chubbiness increases in physic. There are crises in schooling. Marriage is postponed.

But when Venus is inauspicious, there is a lessening in marital satisfaction. Remedy - Go to the temple of Mother Laxmi and offer white sweets. Saturn Saturn is a wicked planet. Saturn is the god of righteousness. The activity of this planet is incredibly slow. Therefore, this Zodiac shifts in two and a half years. Shani is more in a debate about his sadhe sati and dhaiya. Due to the inauspiciousness of Saturn, laziness, emergencies, bone illnesses, and divergence from the father begin. Remedy- Donating black things on Saturday to needy people or 4th class employees like sweeper; will be promising. Rahu Ketu Rahu and Ketu are both horrible planets. Due to Rahu-Ketu, Kalsarp Dosh is constructed in the horoscope. Where if Rahu is inauspicious then native has to face head injury, mental disorder, etc. At the same time, due to the inauspiciousness of Ketu, one has to be a sufferer of deception. Remedy- To lessen the impact of Rahu-Ketu, one should donate clothes, coconut, urad dal, etc. to a needy person. Know Which Planet Affects Which Relationship Surya is related to our relationship with our father. If a person spoils relationships with his father and does not respect them, he weakens his sun. Moon is associated with the mother. Moon deteriorates due to a bad relationship with the mother and humiliating them. If your moon is irritated then you are a victim of mental illnesses, your progress stops and you are surrounded by financial troubles. Because of Mars, your relationship with your in-laws and with an uncle, aunt, father's brother, and other relatives is good or bad. Mars is also associated with your relationships with younger siblings. Your relationship with your siblings, maternal uncle, aunt, and your opponents is determined by the planet Mercury. Guru and Venus make your relationship better with your spouse and friends. Due to the planet Saturn, relationships with father, father-in-law, son-daughters and friends become good. Rahu is responsible for the relationship with the paternal grandfather and Ketu for the relationship with maternal grandparents. Rahu's relationship is also with your paternal grandfather's in-laws' side. If your relationships remain right, there is a sense of love, respect, then the planets will have a positive effect on your life and relationships. People take many measures for the positive effects of the planets, but it is better to keep their relationships right by adopting other measures. Vedic Astrologer Expert",

Dashamsha Chart Table - D-10 You can use the following analysis for Dashamsha and other divisional charts: 1. Two planets closely related in a divisional chart give results in their dasha/antardasha related to that divisional chart; 2. Planets located in the lagna and the lord of the lagna in a divisional chart give events related to this divisional chart; 3. The influence of Jupiter on any planet greatly improves the results. The aspect of Jupiter is a blessing. 4. The lagna and lord of the lagna show the happiness of the person from the given fractional chart. At a time when the house of interest is a real situation. 5. Assessing the position of the karaka in the divisional chart Different astrologers interpret the D-10 chart in different ways. Someone pays more attention to it, but than Rashi, to determine their profession. Someone watches it together with Rashi and Navamsha, giving this two more weight when choosing a profession. * * * * * * * * * Dashamsha represents the tenth house in the Rashi chart. It is seen with the Sun, Mercury, Jupiter, and the tenth lord. It indicates strength, position, achievement, status, and skills. If the owner of the tenth is strong, then the person will accomplish great things or achieve his goals in life. It shows the influence of the individual on the world as a whole and his position in it. Dashamsha is important in describing a profession, vocation, aptitude, and career. It shows our karmic influence on life. The owner of the tenth house in Rashi should be strong in Dashamsha, this indicator will show the manifestation of the profession and its achievements in its field. We can also correlate the influence of the Dashas to the Dashamsha, if the owner of the Dasha is strong in the Dashamsha, then the career will most likely progress during its reign. If the influence is negative, then the planet is debilitated, in a bad house, or surrounded by unfavorable planets, then during these unfavorable periods, the career may suffer. This is a good principle to apply to Vargas. Not only hostile Yogas must be taken into account here, but also aspects, planetary positions, conjunctions, ordinary yogas, etc. must be taken into account. * * * * * * * * * Lagna and Lagnesh in Dashamsha - Here we will talk about Dashamsha, a divisional chart that shows a person in his interactions with society - his status, respect for others, the ability to build relationships, and make a career. the first house in dashamsha shows the person in terms of the role he plays in society. Usually, this role is associated with professional activities. By the position of the owner of the Dasamsha Lagna, we can understand what kind of relationship a person wants to enter into with society, what kind of work role will be normal for him, natural, perhaps pleasant. We will judge the degree of desirability of this role by the state of Lagnesh. Below are the results of the position of the lord of Lagna D10 in the houses of this divisional chart. If it is not located alone, then these indications should be supplemented by the influence of the planets associated with it. Both the natural qualities of these planets and the houses they rule in the Dashamsha matter.Lagnesh Dashamsha in houses Lagnesh Dashamsha in the 1st house \u2013 a person tends to choose some kind of \"I profession\" (for example, a singer, clown, politician, teacher). He prefers to work on his own rather than in a team, he wants to make decisions alone. Lagnesh Dashamsha in the 2nd house - the person assumes the role of a guardian, one who supports others. He can work as an assistant, consultant, psychotherapist, healer, or lawyer. Lagnesh Dashamsha in the 3rd house - he is a troublemaker, troublemaker, enthusiast, and innovator. The current situation does not suit him. He always wants to develop and change something. Others can react quite nervously to him because such enthusiasm is not good for every situation (note that the 3rd house is more dusthan, counting from the 10th). In a milder version, such a person does not blindly follow the traditions and routine, but first tries it on himself, and checks for reasonableness. And quite accepts, unless the situation conflicts with his perception. But still, such a person likes to experiment and make some innovations in his work. Lagnesh Dashamsha in the 4th house - a person is removed from society as a whole. He divides people into near and far circles and feels the desire to help only those closest to him. The 4th house is opposed to the 10th, so holding attention to the 4th house (for example, due to the position of the Lagnesh in it) weakens ties with society (10th house). If the 4th house is afflicted, the person may be antisocial (especially if this affliction is supported by some negativity in the fourth house in D1 and D9). In general, this person does not want to play a prominent role in society. Lagnesh Dashamsha 5th house - a person wants to be seen: in politics, teaching, large-scale leadership, and a career in spiritual organizations. He can choose any \"I-profession\". He wants others to listen to him attentively and obey him. Of course, such a position in itself does not guarantee a high post, it only speaks of a desire to stand out at any cost. Usually, the 5th house (power, followers) is associated with a large scale. For example, if such a person is busy teaching, then he will strive to gather the largest possible audience. The 2nd house is also associated with learning, but usually involves one-on-one work, personal contact with the student - tutoring, and individual counseling. Lagnesh Dashamsha in the 6th house - a cavalry attack is characteristic of a person, he seeks to annoy others, and force them to do something. The current situation does not suit him, he interferes in the course of normal work. At the same time, if the 6th house is not affected, this activity may well benefit the cause. Lagnesh Dashamshi in the 7th house - a person wants to set a program of behavior for other people, he is connected with the team, interacts with it, and communicates a lot. He has a desire to take responsibility and bring people together. Lagnesh Dashamshi in the 8th house - a person strives to go beyond the profession. He is attracted by an interdisciplinary approved ch, works at the intersection of sciences, a mixture of methods, and invention. He is often interested in esotericism and can be quarrelsome and scandalous. Such a person retires with pleasure because he always has something to do. This provision may indicate that a person feels superfluous among people, and therefore he wants to \u201cget out\u201d of society somewhere. A man can live a double life - during the day he is a modest official, and at night he is a member of the Dirty Greedy Dogs motorcycle club. Lagnesh Dashamshi in the 9th house - a person is constantly trying to become a role model, a moral authority. He strives for power, but not formal, direct power. He should be respected simply for who he is, and not for any achievements. Of course, there are no guarantees that a person will be able to acquire the desired status. The Rashi chart, Navamsha, and Shashtamsha will play their role. Lagnesh Dashamshi in the 10th house - a person identifies himself through a profession and his place in society. I am an engineer, or I am a lieutenant colonel. This position usually manifests itself through a colossal attachment to one's work. It is very difficult for such a person to retire because he ceases to understand who he is. And emptiness reigns in life. Lagnesh Dashamsha 11th house - a person tends to strive for profit or efficiency. He does not necessarily strive for profit, rather, he enjoys the establishment of processes. A very good position for an economist, manager, or entrepreneur. Lagnesh Dashamsha in the 12th house - a person is immersed in work, workaholism is possible. He is characterized by an interest in the unusual, innovation, and restlessness. He has a colossal desire for independence, to the point that such a person categorically cannot obey anyone. Its activity is very uneven (Upachaya from the 10th).By carefully studying the above list, you may notice that some houses turn out to be very similar in some qualities. So, for example, labor independence can be shown by both the 1st and 12th houses. Independence in the 1st house is close to self-sufficiency (the person is sure that he is well done, that he will prove himself successfully and he does not need any help). Independence according to the 12th turns out to be somewhat painful, even a little \u201cchildish\u201d (a person is cramped and stuffy in a team, he wants new lands and new approaches, he is unable to adhere to the rules and follow instructions). Workaholism can be associated with the 10th and 12th houses. If the 10th house is manifested, a person will work hard, because he has found himself, and has the opportunity to be realized in his workplace. And if the 12th house is expressed, the person works hard. He pounces on work and actively works, and then, having stopped in exhaustion, he cannot enter the working mode again, cools down to the process, and begins to look for new ideas.Social passivity can be shown by both the 4th (that which opposes the 10th, work) and the 8th house (a person has a favorite hobby, and work only distracts him). Any quality can be represented by a combination of several Dashamsha houses. For example, perfectionism can be associated with strong and unaffected 1st, 10th, or 12th houses. Hunger for power - with a strong 5th house and its lord. Practicality, the desire to be sure to receive a reward for any work done - with strong 10th and 11th houses (perhaps they will contain the rajasic planets, Venus and Mercury). The planets located in the Dashamsha Lagna will give us the touches to the portrait of a person as a worker. Each of us has a work role, a mask that we put on when we begin our professional duties. So, if in the 1st house in D10 are: - Saturn or Mercury, a person will be pedantic and orderly in work; - Venus can give either a desire for beauty or commercialism and practicality; - Jupiter or Moon - softness and courtesy; - Mars - rudeness, and energy (sometimes excessive); - The sun - lust for power and the desire to obtain recognition and awards; - Rahu or Ketu will show the unusual or vagueness of the working role. The Lagna sign in Dashamsha, in my practice, does not manifest itself very clearly. It is more useful to focus on the planets in the 1st house and its ruler. * * * * * * * * * Meanings of houses and planets in Dashamsha Varga Dashamsha or D-10, shows great, big, huge results, fruits, and achievements. Dashamsha is directly related to the tenth house and unfolds the role of a person in social, and professional activities, success or growth in a career, social position, and achievements in society. Dashamsha gives the key to the way of being, power, authority, and realization of our ambitions and goals, all of which can lead us to the pinnacle of achievement and development. Dashamsha Chart Table - D-10 A very important keyword for the tenth house is \"Svadharma\" (individual or personal path), if the ninth house regulates the universal dharma, then the tenth - is the individual dharma, which depends on the individual characteristics of the person. Svadharma determines what a person must do to develop further. The tenth house in Rashi and Dashamsha not only shows our career and professional opportunities, but also symbolizes our role in the outside world, and affirms the heights that we can achieve. Another important keyword is \"Karma-sthana\", the meaning of which is to represent the final flowering of karma, that is, activities or actions give a chance to eliminate karma through one's path (svadharma). Therefore, the highest manifestation of the planets in the 10th house is the self-realization of a person. Main steps in Dashamsha analysis 1. Kendra trikona Kendras - 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th houses are the main pillars that support your path outside and determine all four goals of life, Dharma, Moksha, Kama, and Artha. Kendra houses - the basis of the horoscope - 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th The first house shows the natural qualities of the individual, which a person uses on his way in society, profession, and social activity. The fourth house is an internal or personal definition of security or security, that is, confidence, which includes a genetic unconscious sense of belonging to a community or social activity. As the third house from the second house, the fourth house is associated with the desire to put down roots and achieve stability. Like the second house from the third, the fourth house is associated with the search for situations and people who can provide material and moral support. The 7th house is about how we interact with others and how we relate to others. So, personal natural qualities, with inner feelings of confidence and with other people (partners in business or entrepreneurship), are realized in the aggregate in the tenth house. 2. Artha trikona In Dashamsa, the houses of Artha trikona (finance, money) are important: the 2nd house (available resources), the 6th house (the ability to overcome difficulties, loans, loans, debts), and the 10th house determining the choice of profession. Planets here will have a direct impact on life. Any planet in the 10th house on its own creates a good yoga that signifies growth and success. All these three houses give the desire to work and earn. The 10th house in the birth chart is our labor activity, our activity, efforts, etc., while the ruler of the tenth house is the significator of activity. 3. Dashamsha Lagna In Dashamsha, the lagna is ourselves in the aspect of labor activity. The 10th house in Dashamsha shows the workplace itself, organization, enterprise, hobby, and whatever we do; perhaps the tenth house and its ruler in Dashamsha most reveals the field of activity in the professional field. The position of the Amatya Karaka is an indicator of important results; Axis Rahu / Ketu, which has a huge karmic influence on life; Each of the ten dashamshas, \u200b\u200bwhich has its divine patrons, determines the specific nature of the influence. Features of Dashamsha 1. Kendra houses - 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th are stronger than upachaya houses - 3rd, 6th, 11th, and the 10th house is considered the strongest. 2. The 2nd and 12th houses do not have their strength and depend on the strength of their rulers. 3. A planet in any Kendra in Dashamsha shows special significance in social or professional life, bringing wide popularity. If there are no planets in the Kendras, it can be assumed that the native will not gain fame. 4. Benefic planets in the 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th houses promote career growth, malefics here do not promote economic growth. 5. Lord of 9th, 12th houses, and badhakasthana show travel/foreign journeys. 6. The 8th house always brings evil or trouble and is never stronger than the nature of the Lagna. 7. Career is shown by the stronger of the Artha Trikona houses: 2nd, 6th, or 10th house. 8. The 10th house is not always the most important for indications of professional activity, it is worth looking at the entire Artha trikona - the 2nd, 6th, and 10th houses, the strongest of them will indicate the influence on the profession/career. 9. A retrograde planet shows a strong desire from a past life. 10. Atma-karaka (AK) - shows the soul of a person and the forces that are given to overcome obstacles. 11. Dharma-trikona defines dharma in society. When there are no planets in the trikona, one should find the ruler and check the location of the Atma-karaka. 12. Marana Karaka Sthana (MKS) for Sun - 12th, Moon - 8th, Mars and Mercury - 7th, Venus - 6th, Saturn - 1st, Rahu - 9th, and Jupiter - 3rd house. 13. The sun represents the karaka for service. 14. Burnt planets show immoral power/ ability. 15. Parivartana between the lords of a dusthana and a Kendra is not very auspicious, while between the lords of a Kendra and a trikona it is very auspicious. 16. To see the progress of Rahu and Ketu in the house, it is necessary to subtract their longitude from 30 degrees. However, to see how close they are to other planets in the same house, take their longitudes as they are. If Rahu strikes Jupiter, then turn your prayers to the Sun for help. On the contrary, if Rahu strikes the Sun, he prays for the help of Jupiter. 17. Kendradhipati dosha or the negative effect of ownership of the kendras: Naturally benefic planets reduce their beneficent qualities but do not become inauspicious. Naturally unfavorable planets, having kendras, do not remain unfavorable, but it does not mean that they become benefactors either. 18. Mercury is the main karaka for the tenth house in the Dashamsha and the secondary ones are Jupiter for growth, and expansion, the Sun represents power and authority, Saturn for a position in the social hierarchy, and Mercury for social communication skills. For career advancement, these Karakas must be favorably placed in the Dashamsha. Dashamsha D10 - profession and career chart Analysis of Dashamsha Houses Dasamsa Lagna: The nature of a person's karma is shown by the ruler of the amsha. for example, the ascendant in Brahma amsa shows deepening / immersion in affairs on his own, Rahu in Lagna indicates research, and Surya in Lagna in Ananta amsa indicates the spread and management of spirituality. Vargottama Lagna Dashamsha gives strength to the career. The Dasamsa Lagna or the first house in the Dashamsa shows the qualities through which one gains fame and achievement associated with work. Lagnesh Dashamsha shows attitude and motives in work. Dashamsha Lagna in the water \"Brahmanic\" sign (4th - Cancer, 8th - Scorpio, 12th - Pisces) determines the natural intellectual qualities of a person used in their activities, using their intuition and deep understanding of the essence of things. The brahminical quality is a pronounced intellect and high moral principles. Dashamsha Lagna in earth signs (2nd Taurus, 6th Virgo, 10th Capricorn) - Shudra: determines the ability to perform a large amount of work, practicality, and rationality. Dashamsha Lagna in air signs (3rd Gemini, 7th - Libra, 11th - Aquarius) - vaishya: determines the ability to manage one's property or team, establish new ties in society, are skilled in business, and work with finances. Dashamsha Lagna in fire signs (1st - Aries, 5th - Leo, 9th - Sagittarius) - Kshatriyas: they have the qualities of a leader, organizer, will, courage, can make decisions and take responsibility, and competently manage people. Dasamsha Lagna in male signs endows a person with activity, initiative, and independence. Dasamsha Lagna in odd signs endows a person with creativity, knowledge, preservation, good adaptability to external conditions, great inner strength, and spirituality. The second house in Dashamsha shows investments, and resources available, including speech as a power of influence. If the 2nd house is strong, then those who have resources are very strong, it can be a bank account or family material resources. The ruler of the 2nd house will show the source of possible reserves. The third house in Dashamsha represents changes in work/profession/business in the form of a short vacation, and a short break in activities. A benefic planet in the third house causes some level of weakness in motivation or drive as far as profession/work/business is concerned. The third house indicates agreements and connections, efforts made. The 3rd house becomes very important after Lagna, as it represents the overall efforts of one's own in business, career, business, and profession. The ruler of the third house denotes short journeys or work involving short journeys. The fourth house in Dashamsha indicates ownership of property, business office, premises, and location of work/business. The ruler of the 4th house indicates the secretary or people close to whom there is trust. As well as an indicator of a profession/business related to real estate, mining, transport, design, etc. Benefic planets in the 4th house, through the aspect to the 10th house, increase the opportunities for career growth, while inauspicious ones decrease. The 5th house in Dashamsha shows power, career recognition, and also a subject that one is well versed in, for example, the Sun in the 5th house gives good administration or possession of political influence, the Moon gives considerable knowledge of people and culture. The 5th house is the house of intellect, understanding, awareness, followers, people working for you or under you, and workers in the business. The ruler of the 5th house shows direct subordinates. If the lord of the Dasamsa Lagna is in the 5th house, the person generally prefers to be a subordinate or a servant. Planets in the 5th house, A5, and 5th house from Arudha Lagna will indicate job opportunities. The fifth house (birth, beginning) is the eighth house (transformation, transformation, longevity) from the tenth house (activity) and will show changes in the place of work or changes in the work itself, additional powers, or the prospect of new jobs. The fifth house is the eighth from the tenth and represents birth (beginning) and length of life (time of duty/activity - 10th house). Thus, the fifth house governs power and strength, which a person enjoys through skill and knowledge, as well as Purvapunya (good karma). The timing of the beginning of new work is done from the fifth house. 6th House in Dashamsha - planets in the 6th can determine career, service, and work. The functions of the staff are also shown by this house. The ruler of the house will point out the damage caused by the enemies. The debilitated sixth lord and the strong tenth lord will form Jaya Yoga - victory over enemies during the dasha/antardasha period of the lords. The sixth house usually shows employment, while the seventh house usually shows personal business. If the 6th house is strong or occupied by strong benefactors, then the person will have a good job. On the other hand, if the 7th house is strong, then the native will be busy in business. The malefic lord of the 7th house in debilitation (nicca) tends to work for hire. The 7th house in Dashamsha represents the start of business or loss of service (this is the maraka house for the 6th house), interaction with others, and the lord of the 7th will show how a person interacts in social relationships. If the 7th is stronger than the 6th house, then the person has a greater propensity for doing business. The seventh house is associated with the type of business. The ruler of the 7th house in the 8th house will constantly bring in a lot of confusion in relationships with partners (provided the business with partners). Let's say Venus is the karaka of desire in any chart if Rahu, being the lord of the 6th in the 7th, gives an undesirable combination for business. This combination shows that the person has a strong desire (7th house) to do business, but Rahu, being the lord of the 6th house, tends to make him work hard and overcome difficulties. As a result of this combination, it is recommended that you first work for someone to acquire the necessary skills (in your chosen specialty) and then become an independent consultant - this is good advice for realizing opportunities in Rahu. Rule: People with a natural ability for business, and entrepreneurs, have the 3rd or 11th lord in the 7th house. Rule of the houses from Lagna is always a major theme for any planet, the house they occupy is the resources they have access to and the role they play. The 7th house is the 10th house from the 10th and is considered very important in the context of doing business. Planets in the 7th house indicate careers and activities in the sphere. The sun is the karaka of leaders, gives a career in politics, The moon gives work in hotels, restaurants, and pastry shops. Mars gives service to the police or the army. Mercury inclines to the activities of a journalist, writer, publishing, and business. Jupiter represents lawyers, lawyers, judges, and advisors. Venus includes entertainment and work related to art and beauty. Saturn gives hard work or work-related to machinery. Rahu shows business. Ketu - export. The 8th house in Dashamsha shows retirement, hidden things, a long break in career, work/business, or a significant delay. The 8th house indicates loans, business loans, debts, and inherited business/profession. The 8th is the house of retirement from service, being the 11th house from the 10th house. The ruler of the eighth house shows unexpected events or hard work. Lagnesha Dashamsa in the 8th house means one who works hard with great desire. Whenever the lord of the 8th is associated with any raja yoga, the latter is weakened. The 8th house, if without defeat and debilitating influences, can give huge loans for the realization of large enterprises, and its Argalas on the 7th and 10th houses can give a new motivation to business. If the 8th house is weak or afflicted, then the business may face endless debt or decline. The ninth house in Dashamsha shows the sense of dharma. The house of the dharma/boss may also show higher education regarding career advancement and possible travel abroad in line with one's occupation. The lord of the ninth house will indicate the person who helps and supports (father, guru, guidance). If the lord of the 9th house is located in Lagna, then helpers and mentors take care of our well-being. The ninth house is the significator of the independence and freedom we enjoy. In a birth chart, Lagnesh in the 9th house gives us an independent spirit and convictions, and in Dashamsha indicates an independent occupation or an independent profession, similar to that of a lawyer or businessman. If Lagnesh Dashamsha is placed in the 9th house, then the person will strive for independence in activities, this position is more suitable for business than for hired labor. Malefic planets in the 9th house give dominating and aggressive leaders or bosses that create difficult working conditions, especially with the presence of an unfavorable lagna lord in the 9th house. The 9th lord in the 10th house shows favorable career advancement without much effort. The lord of the 9th in the 6th house favors making enemies. The tenth house in Dashamsha shows the company itself, the organization associated with the role of activity, the tenth lord is responsible for the success of the company, but the actual career is given by the stronger of the planets associated with combinations of the 10th house. If the lord of the 10th house is exalted in the birth chart and the lord of the tenth house is debilitated in the Dashamsa, then the career will fluctuate between success and failure, between visible and invisible prospects. The native, gifted by nature, will struggle with conflicting public opinions or assessments. On the other hand, if the ruler of the tenth house in the birth chart and Dashamsha are favorable, then this is a sure sign of a bright and successful career. 10th lord in 8th gives instability/career instability. The owner of the 10th in the 11th, in his period, will bring career development and a good income. Jupiter is the karaka of growth and prosperity, fame, and respectability. Saturn is the karaka of actions, all kinds of work, and fate (karma). Mercury is the karaka of profession and career. The sun is a karaka of social status. The nature and position of these karaka planets are also important for a complete analysis of the Dashamsha Varga. The tenth house gives Argala on the 6th, 7th, 9th, and 12th, thus directly affecting enemies, business associates, wealth, and sleep that these houses govern, among other things. The king will never fall if the servants are devoted to him. When the servants are betrayed, the sixth house is favorable and the enemies also ruled by the sixth cannot win. This automatically elevates the status ruled by the tenth house. Success automatically brings more business and partners, in addition to the devotion of a happy spouse. The leader, guru, or luck is ruled by the ninth house and is of great importance for one's career. The 10th house from Arudha Lagna in D-10 shows one's true behavior in society and the nature of one's karma/work. Any house in D-10 that contains one or more planets will be significant in social life for the native. If the 6th house is stronger than the 10th house, then a person may work all his life, but will not be able to receive much recognition for his achievements. If the 10th house is stronger than the 6th house, then the native can achieve results and recognition for achievements in a short time. The eleventh house in Dashamsha shows friends, team, and profits, as the house of realized ambitions, set goals, easy money, and gifts. The twelfth house in Dashamsha illuminates long vacations and overseas business services. The 12th lord usually indicates spiritual or voluntary and charitable tendencies or service to others or mistakes and failures, or incapacities. Secret enemies in the 12th house. The 12th house governs final liberation (reincarnation) and meditation. Bad actions in the tenth house adversely affect the 12th house and Moksha is pushed back in the long term (and the dream may disappear in the short term). The perfect resolution to this negative cycle of interconnected events would be to decide to start practicing transcendental meditation. Meaning of Amatyakaraka in Profession/Career Position: If the Amatya Karaka is placed in a Kendra or Trikona from Lagna, or in the 11th house, the career will generally be smooth and unobstructed, while its level will depend on other factors: 1. If the Amatyakaraka is a malefic, badly placed, and badly aspected, it indicates a person who has the determination and energy to rise in life at auspicious times, but not without damaging his reputation. In addition, such a person can be a technocrat. 2. If the Amatyakaraka is a benefactor associated with benefactors, but one of which is debilitated and the other is the lord of, say, the eighth house, it leads to a broken career and a dubious reputation in inauspicious periods. 3. In all cases, without exception, any connection of Amatya-karaka with the sixth ruler and the absence of a connection with the eighth ruler indicates a person's ability to fight in favorable periods of life. If such an Amatyakaraka is aspected by Jupiter or another exalted benefactor, the person prospers in life and shines in the intellectual, artistic, and literary fields, including astrological science. Note here that when the Dasha of a sign containing the Amatya Karaka is in progress, or when the Amatya Karaka is in the tenth or eleventh house from that sign, the period will be very auspicious if the Vimshottari Dasa also confirms this. A well-placed Amatyakaraka, but debilitated and badly aspected, especially by an enemy planet, can bring misfortune.Know Your Planets (Astrology) \u00b7 July 2, 2022The conjunction of Saturn and Mars in astrology: Ice and fireSaturn and Mars are two powerful, but very different forces that have contradictions. The exalted power of victorious Mars is achieved in Capricorn, the sign of Saturn. Thus, hot Mars simply needs a wise Saturn if he intends to achieve his goals. Saturn is the principle of understanding Dharma, discipline, and the quintessence of law and order. Mars is young, hot, and often inexperienced, so the sign of Saturn's fall is Aries. It is Saturn that treats Mars as an enemy, while Mars needs it, it is quite warm - neutral. Mars and Saturn in Vedic astrology is a yoga yantra-karma, influence not only in conjunction but also in aspect. The position of conflict is instructive, especially for Mars. Such a connection in the female horoscope indicates the need for deep, conscious studies about the male principle and requires control of emotions, and respect for men. Much depends on the sign-in in which this connection is present.  Lessons from Mars-Saturn Conjunction: *\u00a0Mars needs to control his initiatives and direct his energy around the house and the sign of the zodiac in an ecologically correct way. *\u00a0Restrain ambition and impulsiveness. To learn patience, and responsibility and not violate karma according to the house and sign in which the connection is present. *\u00a0Transformation of the conflict of ice and fire at all levels, without violent suppression of emotions. A balance is needed in decision-making, between coldness and irascibility, detachment, and aggression. Pluses as a result of the connection: *\u00a0The ability to achieve goals through the inclusion of strategic intelligence (real estate, land, career growth) *\u00a0Wisdom, efficiency, spiritual and material prosperity in the spheres of the house, the sign of the zodiac in which Mars and Saturn are connected *\u00a0Balance, responsibility for your energy, and as a result, you will not perform adharmic actions. Recommendations for harmonizing this connection: *\u00a0Hatha yoga, hardening, fire rituals, austerities for the body, long walking uphill, jogging, etc. will help to balance the energies through the body. *\u00a0I recommend consulting, communicating, and gaining experience from wise, spiritual older people. And also with those who understand the Dharma and know the laws of cause and effect. Even though two hard, conditionally unfavorable planets - \u201cpapa-grahas\u201d are in conflict in your horoscope, you do not need to think about the fatality of the karmic lessons of the Mars-Saturn conjunction. You need to find out and realize the causes of violations of the Dharma by Mars, first of all! Since Saturn, as a planet of Dharma, in conjunction with any planet, focuses attention on its karmic tasks, as if indicating with the finger of fate. Therefore, having learned the lessons on this connection, you will be able to use your energy (Mars) and time (Saturn) with wisdom!https://knowyourplanets.quora.com/The-conjunction-of-Saturn-and-Mars-in-astrology-Ice-and-fire?ch=10&oid=73772348&share=e00b203e&srid=h3V5BQ&target_type=post",

The Sanskrit word karmphala indicates a wider meaning but nowadays the dashmansh chart is used to judge profession mainly.

The Sanskrit word karmphala indicates a wider meaning but nowadays the dashmansh chart is used to judge profession mainly. Few learned astrologers may have doubts about the concept of house division in a divisional chart like dashmansh which is an imaginary one or not a real map like a rashi chart. But before writing further let me clear it first that in shadvarga and Saptavarga this dashmansh chart doesn\u2019t exist but it exists in dashvarga and shodashvarga. In short I want to share that the rashi chart, which is the real one, also comes under divisional charts so if it possesses houses then there is no harm in allotting twelve houses to a dashmansh chart also. Rashi chart, the very first divisional chart in Vedic jyotish was meant for the judgment of the deha or physical body but it is now being used to judge all events including finance, mental disposition, relatives and other valuable things. So this dashmansh chart also needs expansion in its area of applications. Merely on the basis of dashmansh chart the judgment of the profession is not an easy way. According to several astrologers the rashi chart and the dashmansh chart should be compared to judge the line of profession or employment in a nativity but I have found that the chalit chart should also be taken into consideration and it should be compared with the dashmansh chart. In the forthcoming paragraphs few simple but effective information are being provided to understand the twelve houses in a dashmansh chart.The first house of a dashmansh chart indicates professions that include the self mainly, such as self employment, health department or gym etc. In a broader sense the first house of a dashmansh chart should be known as a house of self employment.

Signs, associations and aspects, do changes the effect , however the generalized prediction can be taken as below. Saturn As the slowest moving planet and the chief signification for longevity, Saturn is a barren, binding, cold, dry, hard, defensive and secretive planet. Its effects and influences are felt with greater intensity and for longer periods than any other planet. Saturn is considered to be very favourable for people born in the signs owned by Venus, whereas Saturn is evil to those born in the signs owned by Mercury. The astrological thesis of Lal Kitab describes Saturn as a serpent, whose head or mouth is Rahu and Ketu is its tail. If ketu is posited in earlier houses than Saturn, the latter becomes a great benefic for the native. However, if the position is otherwise, the Saturn throws highest poisonous results on the native. Further, Saturn never gives malefic effects if posited in houses of Jupiter i.e. 2, 5, 9 or 12, whereas Jupiter provides bad results if posited in the house of Saturn. Saturn is considered good in houses 2nd , 3rd and 7th to 12th, whereas 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th houses are bad for Saturn. Sun, Moon and Mars are its enemies, Venus, Mercury and Rahu are friends and Jupiter and Ketu are neutral to it. Saturn gets exalted in 7th house and the 1st house is the house of its debilitation. Venus and Jupiter placed together act like Saturn in that house. Similarly Mars and Mercury placed in a single house act like Saturn in that house. In the former case Saturn behaves like Ketu, while in the latter case it behaves like Rahu. Venus gets destroyed if Saturn is being aspected by the Sun in any horoscope. The aspect of Venus on Saturn causes loss of money and wealth, but the aspect of Saturn on Venus proves highly beneficial. Collision of Saturn and Moon causes operation of the eyes of the native. Saturn gives good results if posited in house earlier than Sun. Saturn can never give malefic results if posited with Sun or Jupiter in a single house, but highly adverse results would follow if posited with Moon or Mars in any house. Saturn releases its poisonous results on the sign and Mars, if it is posited in 1st house, on Mars only if posited in 3rd house, on moon if posited in 4th house, on sun if posited in 5th house, and on Mars in posited in 3rd house. Saturn in 3rd house deprives the native of the accumulation of cash money and kills the children of the native when posited in 5th house and 10th house is empty. It becomes highly benefic in 12th house if friendly planets are posited in 2nd house. Saturn provides very good results if placed in houses 1 to 7 on the condition that 10th house is empty. Saturn in 1st house and sun in 7th, 10th or 11th houses causes all sorts of troubles for native's wife. Combination of Mars and Saturn gives adverse results all through.Saturn in 1st House 1st house is influenced by Sun and Mars. Saturn in 1st house will give good results only when 3rd, 7th or 10th houses are not inhabited by any planet which is inimical to Saturn. If Mercury or Venus, Rahu or Ketu is in 7th house, Saturn will always give good results. In case Saturn is malefic and the native has a hairy body, the native will remain poor. If native celebrates his birthday it will give very bad results However the native will have a long life. Saturn in 2nd House The native will be wise, kind and just. He will enjoy wealth and will be of religious temperament. However, whether Saturn is benefic or malefic in this house, it will be decided by the planets placed in 8th house. The state of finance of the native will be decided by 7th house, the number of male members in the family by 6th house and age by 8th house. When Saturn is malefic in this house, after the native's marriage his in laws will face problems. Saturn in 3rd House In this house Saturn gives good results. This house is the pukka Ghar of Mars. When Ketu aspects this house or is placed here Saturn will give very good results. The native will be healthy, wise and very intuitive. If the native is wealthy he will have few male members in the family and vice versa. As long as the native abstains from wine and non-vegetarianism, he will enjoy a long and healthy life. Saturn in 4th House This house belongs to Moon. So it will give mixed results in this house. The native will be devoted to his parents and will be of loving nature. Whenever the native is suffering from bad health, the use of things associated with Saturn will give good results. In native's family some one will be associated with medical profession. When Saturn is malefic in this house drinking wine, killing of snakes and laying the foundation of the house at night will give very bad results. Drinking milk in the night will also give bad results. Saturn in 5th House This house belongs to Sun, which is inimical to Saturn. The native will be proud. He should not construct a house till 48 years, otherwise his son will suffer. He should live in the house bought or constructed by his son. He should keep articles of Jupiter and Mars in his ancestral house for welfare of his children. If the native has hairy body, he will be dishonest. Saturn in 6th House If the work related to Saturn is done at night it will always give beneficial results. When marriage takes place after 28 years it will produce good results. when Ketu is well placed the native will enjoy wealth, profitable journey and happiness from children. when Saturn is malefic bringing things associated with Saturn, like leather and things of iron, will give bad results, especially when Saturn is in 6th house in varshaphal Saturn in 7th House This house is influenced by Mercury and Venus, both friends of Saturn. so this planet gives very good results in this house. The professions associated with Saturn, like machinery and iron, will be very profitable. If the native maintains good relation with his wife, he will be rich and prosperous, will enjoy a long life and good health. If Jupiter is in 1st house, there will be gain from government. Saturn becomes malefic if the native commits adultery and drinks wine. If the native gets married after 22 years his eyesight will be affected adversely. Saturn in 8th House In 8th house no planet is considered auspicious. The native has a long life, but his father's life span is short and native's brothers turn out to be his foes. This house is considered headquarter of Saturn, but it will give bad result if Mercury, Rahu and Ketu are malefic in the native's horoscope. Saturn in 9th House Native will have three houses. He will be a successful tour operator or civil engineer. He will enjoy a long and happy life and parents also will have a happy life. Maintaining three generations will protect from the bad effects of Saturn. if the native is helpful to others Saturn will always give good results. The native will have a son, though he will be born late. Saturn in 10th House This is Saturn's own house, where it will give good results. The native will enjoy wealth and property as long as he does not get a house constructed. Native will be ambitious and enjoy favours from government. The native should behave with shrewdness and should do his work while sitting at one place; only then he will enjoy the benefits of Saturn. Saturn in 11th House Native's fate will be decided at the age of forty eight years. The native will never remain childless. Native will earn money by shrewdness and deceit. Saturn will give good or bad results according to the position of Rahu and Ketu Saturn in 12th House Saturn gives good results in this house. Native will not have enemies. He will have many houses. His family and business will increase. He will be very rich. However Saturn will become malefic if the native starts drinking wine and becomes non-vegetarian, or if the dark room in the house is illuminated.",

Saturn retrograde 138 days a year. Saturn is structuring in the significance of giving a means of finding extents, a bracket, a boundary, also in the sense of respect for rigour, earnestness, temporality, knowledge or even destiny ... Saturn is a planet of public and united consciousness like Jupiter and Mars, but less chatty, more restrictive, drastic, disciplined, prudent, it prohibits us ... Saturn is our anxiety of evolving, the difficulty of others, anxiety of life, uncertainty of love, and all these amassed fears lead us to frequent interviewing. So here is the \u201cgreat maleficent\u201d of which formal astrology talks! (as contradicted to the \u201clittle maleficent\u201d that is Mars ) In the portrayal of outstanding racisms, if Jupiter is celebration and pomp, Saturn sounds like the edge of opening \u2026 Yet all life, all fact even, needs configurations and constraints (even our burden of action which is then associated with intuition ). Trees do not go up to the sky, the fact law constantly ends up sending us back to the idea of the cycle, and a cycle is a portion of a defined frame, therefore restricted, there must be \u201cstops\u201d. So is it so awful to incorporate as logic? We should relatively thank! Saturn sends us the technique, the reasoning, the aroma for effort, persistence, abstinence and intimacy, engagement, domain, the feeling to remember the temporary time and forbearance, the stability, the permanence, the commitment, the group, everything that authorizes us to think logically and to have formative efforts, what we call our \"experiences\". Saturn is in a way the successive proportion sheet of Jupiter, it authorizes us to restore our social profits or to incorporate our losses. Admittedly, this Saturnian authenticity can be huge, communicate a certain sincerity and the obligations which happen from it are heavy too (one suffers a specific fatality), and this very often directs to isolation (occasionally with a Depression ) ... not the \"party of Trigon \" of Jupiter, or at least the status that he comprehends ... But these improved capabilities of introversion can lead to tremendous self-awareness, to deep contemplation, to adulthood, and once sublimated, to the advancement of the psyche and the psyche, then to esoteric states in a substantial sense of knowledge. It is the \u201c Coagulation \u201d of the alchemical method, a stage so poorly comprehended. Wanting Jupiter without ratifying Saturn is stupid and unfortunately particular of our current community ... many of our social crises stem from this reason of rejecting to set boundaries. When Jupiter broadens, Saturn fixes and crystallizes. When Jupiter is in the endless entrance, Saturn is in rigorous and tangible insufficient control (often established on binary Manichaeism). Saturn and Jupiter are companions. Battle Saturnian beliefs expect letting go but finally leads us to more sovereignty. Let us move away once and for all the portrayal of Saturn communicated by formal astrology, of \u201cmisfortunes and penalties \u201d \u2026 In the natal chart, Saturn gives data on intention, tolerance, gravity, domain, engagement, faculties of formation and structuring, competence, strength, breadth and kind of understanding, knowledge and his professions of self-denial, his inclinations to mysticism\u2026 Saturn also exemplifies the father, not in the imaginative sense of the Sun, but the teacher, trainer and occasionally, drastic and punishing father, Saturn exemplifies teaching, myth and origins. Saturn in the natal chart : Saturn in Sign tells us about the procedure of traditionalism, it demonstrates the ancestor of consciousness, gravity, the identity and the way to conquer complications and exceed the mind, as well as practically how we relinquish all our adulthood, our structuring capabilities, and other Saturnian \u201cqualities\u201d, how we organize the \u201cfears\u201d that the planet conveys, the \u201cresonance\u201d that we have with them. Saturn in Houses demonstrates the area of action where the need for structuring will be met, where the constructiveness and endurance of the native will be. It is the area of efficiency and insurance (at least where one strives to give rise to these qualities), where diplomacy is beneficial, but also a place of probable loneliness, corpulence and resignation to sovereignty. (state, boss or others). The outstanding \u201cfear\u201d can be more existing in this area of life, giving rise to back different uncertainties, and asking to be specifically sublimated, exceeded\u2026 Because there can be a feeling of constraint, hesitation, dereliction, or having to \u201cdo a lot more\u201d than in other areas where things are more voluntary. And with Saturn, it may take more time, where the planet is, it is often an area that will not bestow its full capacity until the age of adulthood. In Aspect and transits, Saturn will underscore temporality, it will give rise to time or revise its emotional understanding. The planet can also emphasize scepticism, tensions, frustrations, reluctance. It can impose restrictions on, required profession, its process is that of obligation and someone and moral maturity. It often demonstrates the probable phases of adulthood, the crises and the understanding which result from it, the formative examinations, therefore the standpoints of advancement, examination, assignment and final support. Its area therefore often symbolizes a certain corpulence, a deceleration, wait, a position of declaration, inferiority complex, guilt and denial of responsibility, a cognitive, subjective and occasionally even biological blockage, which must survive with flexibility without falling into extreme rigidity and crystallization. But it stimulates independence, it renovates psychically and periodically comprising physically. The Saturn cycle embodies over 28 years or so, a very significant climacteric period in development, first in the method of Individuation and public integration, then in possible procedures of greatness. Saturn is not a \u201c awful planet\u201d in itself, it is how it is competent and incorporated that will make its final \u201cquality\u201d, but Saturn can be very beneficial and structuring! The problems stimulated, even periodically the disappointments and the penalties, the loneliness, and the contemplation that belongs with it can lead to new headquarters, new purposes, new vitalities and aspirations \u2026 so many elements giving rise to the essential modifications - and imperatives - to guarantee individual particular development and a good competition of the destiny through actual successes. If these modifications are not incorporated by the force of time, by the way of knowledge, and there is friction to life on the part of the native, they will be experienced - or rather suffered - as so many superficial limitations, sometimes embodying itself through enemies\u2026 Saturn very often demonstrates the finality of stuff, a certain fatality: like the Supreme Court, it has the ultimate say. Retrograde Saturn tends to communicate itself in the colours of its second sign of proficiency, Aquarius. Retrograde Saturn in Natal Chart implies greater introversion (structuring is based on interior characteristics slowing its construction), a rebirth of seriousness and rigidity (strong resistance to change), or occasionally impatience and a lack of adulthood, it can also mean an inferiority complex (strong self-criticism and worthlessness), fragility and hypersensitivity, a lack of stability or safety (he is much less ambitious than direct Saturn ), suppressed fear (and pessimism), a difficulty with the father (non-standard manifestation, absence) and a problem in finding a proportion in the mastery and use of power. On the optimistic side, Saturn retrograde can provide stability and an indifferent appearance which can help in social theatre; the native will be in search of the perfect control of his nature, with a strong profession and abnegation, as well as a sense of asceticism. Monitor his comeback in straightforward walking progress. Nonetheless, as a slow planet, the Downgrade to Native Chart is less substantial. In transit, his Demotion of more than 4 and a half months is a duration of internalization of his process in the chart, a restriction of ambition with possibly more responsibilities; this time must be utilized to readjust our bases, rework our purposes (correct and perfect neglected pending cases), review social function and our impact in our socio-professional environment ... This questioning can range from simple awareness, to delay in any enterprise, to further introspection and mysticism. Saturnian dismay and uncertainties can be reactivated during the transit by passing over key facts of the chart. Saturn's retrograde refines intelligence and long-term planning if the subject manages to show the necessary patience and perseverance, the planet tests our inner limits; we must continue to dig into the impacted House, not give up, show attention and agree to withdraw. In absolute terms, this period is a good time to close old files and take on new responsibilities, but not to voluntarily initiate new major changes with new responsibilities. Do not forget that astronomically, the Retrogradation arc of the outer planets corresponds to an Opposition to the Sun(tension with our will), Saturn being, therefore, closest to the Earth, it is advisable to monitor the development of the loop. To be specified according to its function in the chart and the transit, as well as the dominant natal chart (study Houses concerned, other Aspects and transits, etc.).THE CHARACTER OF A SATURNIAN A native whose horoscope will be strongly marked by Saturn will have qualities of wisdom, realism, introversion, calm, discretion, fidelity, pride, modesty, humility, punctuality, prudence ... Solitary, silent, calculating, ambitious, willful, conscientious and hardworking, hard, tenacious, intelligent with good faculties of analysis, memorization and observation, he has a keen sense of responsibility and organization. He is a long-term conservative, able to be passionate but knowing how to dominate his impulses with a maturity of mind and capacities of renunciation until total stripping. For him, he perceives asceticism as a form of a sculpture of the body and the mind, but he has a risk of nervous \u201coverflow\u201d by dint of too much self-control, of excessive physical self-control than emotional. He is entertained by older people in common but is not worried about celibacy. Saturn symbolizes religion (monks, hermits), men of knowledge, statesmen, the administration and the state in general ... Saturn in the negative: lack of emotional warmth, cold and impassive, hides his feelings, misanthropic, harsh and cruel, uncompromising, greedy and tight-fisted, possessive, jealous, far-fetched, bitter, selfish, fatalistic, resigned, pessimistic ... Character traits that we find especially in Capricorn and to a lesser extent Aquarius (his houses). In the progression of life, Saturn exemplifies old age around 70 and beyond until demise, a duration of withdrawal from a healthy life, contemplation and loneliness. The planet represents the old wise men, the grandparents, all the people of experience ...

Saturn in House 2 or Taurus in the natal chart - Questions of value and material aspects, this position requires more fundamentally work on Being and Having ...

Saturn in House 6 or Virgo in the natal chart - Very mental, intellectual, analytical, with a very critical eye too, this position underlines the serious investment in its social function ... Saturn in House 7 or Libra in the natal chart - Here in the house of relational projections, the planet can precisely face Saturnian energies more directly socially ... Saturn in House 8 or Scorpio in the natal chart - This position mainly materializes an important work of detachment and letting go, of openness, to be carried out during the incarnation ...

Of course, our entire horoscope displays karma and karmic tasks, but retrograde planets show what a person will work out first. Most of the accumulated unfulfilled cases are concentrated there. Retrograde planets are like creditors waiting in line. A person will advance in his life and his development only when he closes all his debts for past incarnations. Until that moment, he will not be happy and satisfied either with himself or from his life. And the Universe, which loves us very much and always helps us, every time gives us new opportunities so that we can repay our debts.  Imagine that you were born in the period of retrograde Jupiter, and you will be the very person who will preach to everyone itch, point fingers at mistakes, get bored. And the Universe will help you to pay attention to your thinking and behaviour. It will especially give you exactly that family and loved ones with whom you will be extremely unhappy. Did not notice it once, two, three, and it will be like this all the time until you see yourself and the suffering of your relatives. And someone will even answer you in kind. Such a repetitive situation unchanged will someday drive you into sadness and depression. Perhaps at first, you will not understand why you \"got\" such people in life. Then you will begin to slowly become aware but deny and reject your behaviour. Then, finally, come to terms with the fact that the main problem was not in those around you, but in you. And then you can take responsibility for your destructive disposition. But it also happens that a person does not want and is not going to admit his shortcomings at all. The Universe sees this and sends more situations and people that would make a person pay attention to their behaviour. And under such an onslaught, a person often breaks down. He becomes very bitter, painful and sick. At the same time, illness is the most desperate and last sign that the Universe can give. And here again, everything depends on the person. Or he perceives this as another punishment and is angry with fate, takes pills, trying to. Or a light bulb comes on in his head, and he begins to look for the psychosomatic causes of this disease, plunging into causal relationships. Where he can find all his answers and clues. And where can he find ways to cure even the most serious diseases. But, I want to believe that if you are reading this text, then you are not so hopeless and still go towards change and transformation you are already looking for yourself and the answers to your questions. Also, the place (house) in which the retrograde planet is located plays an important role. For example, the 7th house (partnership, marriage) will bring an unusual partner. Such relationships will be karmic, perhaps even they will drag on from previous incarnations. What kind of relationship will be shown the characteristics of this planet. If there is a retrograde planet in the children's house, then this is a karmic connection with a child, in a career house - relationships with colleagues and your realization in a career. What kind of karmic debts I'm talking about here? First, two planets always move straight - the Sun and the Moon, they cannot be retrograde. Secondly, the shadow planets - Rahu and Ketu always move only retrograde, so they are initially the most karmic planets that show our debts and purpose. But there is a big difference between them: Rahu indicates the direction in which we need to move to develop ourselves and our soul, and Ketu indicates that we completed in a past life and in this one we no longer need to realize, where Ketu is - there is spent karma. All the other 5 planets show our unfulfilled tasks in a past life, where we got confused or could not do something, which ultimately led to the suffering of our soul and other people. We brought these debts into this incarnation. Retrograde venus In Vedic astrology, Venus personifies love, romantic relationships. And when it finds itself in a retrograde movement, it does not have a very good effect on love relationships, the ability to accept the feelings of another and express its feelings. As a rule, the owner of the horoscope very often chooses unusual partners, does not meet, i.e. he, like a magnet, is karmically drawn to these people. They are looking for the ideal in love, in the creative process or the study. Although there may not be an ideal. They want to control their partner. Hypersensitivity is possible. It is very difficult to part with such people, even if you understand that the relationship has become obsolete and there is nowhere else to go. Because a divorce or separation for these people is great pain and tragedy that they will experience for a very long time. But they can also get out of any romantic relationship too quickly. Another backward movement of Venus can give excessive exactingness, sometimes bordering on reason. For example, a man expects his beloved to be modest and docile, but at the same time proactive and dominant. There may also be some kind of fetish about the appearance: breasts are only of the 2nd size, no more, no less. And it gives a big disappointment in love, because such a person, based on his requirements and obsessions, chooses one thing, but in fact, the person turns out to be different. He has too high expectations and demands. Such a person can look and sometimes go to the side because strong sexual energy prevails in him. It is important for him that beauty, an abundance of money are always present in life, and therefore he is very striving for this, spends money on something expensive, beautiful, Karmic debt on retrograde Venus: A person must necessarily move from material values \u200b\u200bto spiritual ones. Do not chase the wrapper, do not look for the ideal that he invented, but look inside each person, into their soul, feelings, see their content. It is important for him to stop demanding something from others, and learn to accept love and give it back. Control your sexual desires and respect your partner's feelings, accept him for who he is. Live for today. Be content with a tit in your hands, and stop trying to catch a crane in the sky, and then this tit will become the most beautiful bird on the planet. Retrograde mars With retrograde Mars, a person will have a large amount of energy, internal and physical strength, aggression and anger. If this is a woman, then she will be domineering, a leader: controlling and suppressive. Also, these are problems in sexual life, excessively emotional sex, a lot of sex and desires around it, nymphomania, or suppressed sexual energy and lack of sexual desire or frigidity. It is not uncommon for a person to distribute his strength incorrectly. For example, he is too emotional in conflicts and arguments, which greatly drain and destroy him. Such people tend to make many mistakes until they begin to use and apply their energy and strength to the benefit of others. Karmic debt on Mars retrograde: Apply your strength and energy appropriately. Spend it on something blissful, useful, on social activities, physical activity, active life, frequent trips, etc. It is very important to live according to the law of Ahimsa (not harm, never, to anyone, not by word or action), but at the same time not to suppress your power. The dragon cannot pretend that he is a butterfly. But, the dragon can stop destroying everyone around with his fire-breathing disposition if he starts breathing consciously. Think about the mistakes made, analyze them. Before you do or say something, think carefully. Learn to take responsibility for yourself and your life without blaming other people or fate. Be attentive, fast on Tuesdays and only eat hot food. Retrograde mercury It will be either too talkative person, chatterbox, or too taciturn and withdrawn. There may be problems with speech, speaking or writing, with communication, with friends. Such people are distinguished by their thinking, they have rather strong abstract thinking. They are smart people, but due to their possible speech problems, they do not always succeed in translating their thoughts into the right words. They quickly grasp the essence and flow of any conversation, which sometimes leads to some pride. For such people, speech is either a blessing or a curse. But since often we unconsciously do not use what we have been given, therefore a blessing can be a curse. This can manifest itself in the form of swearing words, insults and resentment of another person in words. And then the Universe returns the answer to them. Then such people become outcasts because they are not like everyone else. These people gossip behind their backs. They make mistakes in their work, they lose important documents. Either they will be mega-picky and meticulous, or, conversely, scattered. They will even find fault with a speck of dust and a speck and spread rot for it on the one who allowed this speck. And feelings of superiority and arrogance can manifest. They often enjoy how they can say beautifully or cleverly, take pride in it, indulge their pride. Karmic debt with Mercury retrograde: Do not consider yourself the smartest, most knowledgeable, do not gossip and do not speak behind others' backs. Use your words only in a positive way. Think before speaking. It's good to take Mauna ( fast of silence) on Wednesdays, and in general, if you are a lover of talk, then it is good to be more often in silence, stillness. And for those who have communication problems - just develop their communication skills. Maintain a balance between word and silence. Also, find a balance between attentiveness and relaxation, so that there is no excessive pickiness, but also there is no distraction. Stop heightening yourself at the cost of other people. Get away from pride and narcissism. Retrograde Saturn Retrograde Saturn helps to strengthen a serious attitude to life, to oneself and people, giving organization and discipline. Such a person is strict with himself and others, therefore, prone to any kind of punishment (monetary or prohibitions) about other people, if he is a leader, parent, i.e. if it has some kind of power over people. Retrograde Saturn can manifest itself in a very ambiguous way: either a person will become a pro in his activities, or he will be a completely lazy person who does anything from under the stick. Due to a tendency to severity and punishment, a person may have a great conceit or an inflated self, ambition, such people are demanding on the observance of rules and orders. In this case, there may be despondency and pessimism, a tendency to self-reflection. Retrograde Saturn manifests itself in the form of a too careful attitude to money, prudence, or excessive spending on unnecessary things. It can give great destructive power both for the person himself and for relationships in general. The universe will constantly confront him with responsible and important situations. In which he needs to overcome various inconsistencies, difficulties, disruptions of plans so that a person changes, and until he does this, does not pay attention to the cause of the problems and himself, he will have new difficulties and obstacles in his life. Retrograde Saturn will constantly guide a person on the path of his destiny, and with each unnoticed sign, create new situations: clearer, stronger, and more painful. Until a person understands.  Karmic debt according to Saturn Retrograde: Control yourself, learn self-discipline, which will help you successfully resolve all problems that arise. Help people: in word, indeed, especially the older generation. Be less demanding of other people, change your view of them, reduce expectations and corresponding claims. Letting go and not worry if something doesn't come or doesn't work (or someone doesn't come). Shani teaches that everything comes in due time. It is very favourable to read mantras and scriptures, do yoga, travel to holy places. Retrograde Jupiter The main thing that a person with Jupiter retrograde in the horoscope needs is to find there, understand their mission and the purpose of birth and follow them. Enrich yourself, develop your soul, body and mind. These people can be idealists or perfectionists, and so strongly religious that they can impose their opinions, faith and religion on other people. Often, such people strongly manifest their \u201cI\u201d it seems to them that they are the smartest, that they are always right, and therefore they consider it necessary to teach, instruct, read the notations. True, they may know a lot, but this knowledge is used in the wrong guna. This person has the potential of a teacher, but, as a rule, such people do not know how to teach at all! Because of this, his loved ones may suffer, and from this the owner of the horoscope himself. When there is a teaching potential, it must of course be realized. But, due to inability, non-awareness, it only destroys people and relationships. In a woman's horoscope, he gives an unusual partner, special children with atypical thinking, who are very different in mentality from their parents. Karmic debt for retrograde Jupiter: Adequately assess yourself, your shortcomings and advantages, to find out where you need to move further, to reconsider your values. It is not so violent to follow the rules and norms, what is imposed by society and community. Look wider and larger, see the truth, allow all this to exist and manifest in your consciousness and life. Comprehend the principle of relativity in everything. A person needs to comply with their internal laws and principles, and not those required by the social environment. There is no need to criticize and condemn others for their opinion, it is worth recognizing that everyone is individual, everyone has their values \u200b\u200band their thinking, you cannot impose your own on the other. Don't advise without asking. Until you have been asked, you are not initiated, and whatever you say will be received with hostility or will pass by. Be correct and use in your life the postulates and dogmas that you preach. Personalize what you teach. Teach what you represent. But only if asked to do so! It is important to understand, realize and accept that there is karma, cause-and-effect relationships, and give other people the opportunity to fill their bumps, go their own way. Each of us is not perfect, each of us has lessons and exams in life, so we all need to fail several times, not pass this exam, before completing it with \"excellent\" and moving on to the next step.

The house in your natal chart where Saturn has landed should definitely be paid attention to, because it is not just like that.

Read below. If you do not know where Saturn is in your natal chart, write your date, time and place of birth in the comments, and I will calculate for you. It's free, just for your activity in the comments)1. SATURN IN 1 HOUSE The 1st house is the house of the personality, our Ascendant is determined by the first house, and if Saturn falls into it, then in this life a person needs to develop responsibility, seriousness and discipline. We directly take and train these qualities consciously. The one who has Saturn in the first house should not be afraid to give up what is contrary to your principles, no lies to others and yourself, do not adapt to anyone. If they lie to you - draw conclusions, but do not endure. If you don\u2019t do something yourself - Saturn will do it for you, don\u2019t get rid of deceivers in your environment - you will clean up this environment so much that you may be very surprised. Plus, with Saturn in the first house, you definitely need to keep your teeth, nails and ears in perfect condition. 2. SATURN IN THE 2nd HOUSE If you have Saturn in the 2nd house, then your task in this life is to work out the topic of money, commercialism, not to evaluate people only by money and financial condition. You should be respectful of money. Saturn in the 2nd house teaches this. Keep track of what, where and how much you spend. Also, be sure to pay attention to your health, specifically - immunity. But do not treat when it is already sick, but take preventive measures - vitamins, dietary supplements, hardening, sports - this is all ideal for you. Keeping the body in good shape and observing nutrition is a must in this position of Saturn. More importantly, if you have Saturn in the 2nd house, you definitely have a talent that you are afraid to develop and show to others. So nothing will happen to you in this regard, you definitely need to work in this direction, pump yourself, overcome and learn - only then everything will turn out and work out. Forward!3. SATURN IN 3rd HOUSE If your Saturn is in the 3rd house, then learning is your topic. Read a lot, have a library at home - this is right for you. Learn everything that has a soul. Courses, webinars, any training - just make a plan and move on it. Learning is your study. With Saturn in the 3rd house, it is imperative to resolve and work through any problems that arise with siblings or with neighbors if there are no close relatives. Don't shut up. Understand that all the conflicts in your life - they are given so that you grow and work out as a person. If you had problems during your school years - be sure to get it all out of there and work it out - yourself or with a psychologist - it doesn\u2019t matter. If you delay postponing, these problems will still come out, but at the most inopportune moment, and you will still have to solve them, so it\u2019s better to do it voluntarily and on your own terms. Be sure to be careful with driving and following the rules, all, especially traffic rules. On the return of Saturn, a situation of moving may arise - not to another mainland, but to another city at least. If such a situation arises - do not resist, in the end everything will be good. 4. SATURN IN 4TH HOUSE If your Saturn is in the 4th house, then you definitely have some kind of problem in the family, which stretches right from the 7th generation to you. Plus, with such Saturn, it may be that one of your relatives treats you very strictly and asks a lot. Not necessarily one of the parents, but some significant adult - maybe an uncle, grandfather or grandmother. This is your work. Be respectful, but don't let them rub their feet on you. Always put yourself first, do not bend for the sake of others and to the detriment of your interests. With Saturn in the 4th house, take seriously the place where you live - a house or an apartment - it doesn't matter, it's good if there are wooden details in the interior - furniture, photo frames and pictures, whatever. If your Saturn is in the 4th house, it is imperative to solve all problems with your mother. Women with Saturn in the 4th house definitely need to work out and hone all the feminine qualities in themselves - from the health of the female genital organs to feminine manifestations in everyday life.5. SATURN IN 5TH HOUSE At the age of the return of Saturn, if you have it in the 5th house, then it is imperative and very serious to work out everything related to your personal life. No promiscuous relationships, no casual romances, develop discipline and a deep understanding of relationships between people. The theme of children is always very important for people with Saturn in the 5th house. If a child comes to you during the return of Saturn, he is exactly according to karma, and he will give you a lot to work through and understand. You definitely need to be serious about children and everything connected with them, education should not be slipshod, but conscious. Saturn in the 5th house really appreciates if you limit yourself in some way, specifically in entertainment and partying. It is better for you to rest in places where there is no noise and a large crowd of people - this will be more resourceful and useful for you. Perceive any occurring events from the position not \"why is this to me?\", but \"why is this to me?\". 6. SATURN IN 6TH HOUSE If you, like me, have Saturn in the 6th house, then you need to pay a lot of attention to the topic of health, not only your own, but in general. Don't wait until something hurts, work in advance in all areas of your health. Plus, if you have Saturn in the 6th house, then you have something to work on on the topic of animals. If you have an animal or even several at home, this is an excellent study with such a Saturn. Saturn in the 6th house will definitely lead you on the path of service to people in the highest sense. Not service, but service. Help people. Sometimes you need to work at a job that you don\u2019t really like, but if circumstances develop this way, then it will be better for you, and if you don\u2019t complain about fate, but accept everything that is given to you, then in the end you can get a huge reward, which you can\u2019t even think about now. If you go in the direction of medicine with Saturn in the 6th house, it will be just an ideal study of the topic of service and health. It is not necessary to become a doctor and go to get medical education. You can treat not only the body, but also the soul, plus there are a lot of alternatives to traditional medicine. Homeopathy, osteopathy, energy practices that work with health, the same psychology - all this will do. Plus, if you are fired or forced to quit during the return of Saturn, this is a sign that everything is going as it should.7. SATURN IN 7TH HOUSE A person who has Saturn in the 7th house will be taught and worked out through relationships, marriages and through enemies. There may be problems with the law if you do not absorb what they are trying to tell and show you. Relationships with people are also your area of \u200b\u200bstudy. It is important to realize that certain relationships give you, and not to hold on to them if they have already outlived themselves. If the relationship is over - do not cling, let go. With such Saturn, both early marriages and later ones are possible, depending on what exactly your soul needs to work through. 8. SATURN IN THE 8TH HOUSE Saturn in the 8th house teaches and gives lessons through other people's money - loans, inheritance, and so on. It is important to take all the lessons that are given to you seriously and wisely. Do not try to get something by deceit or cunning - everything will come out, and you will also fly for it. With Saturn in the 8th house, you need to work through your fears, but not rush into them with your head, but do it wisely. If you are afraid of something, then do not do it through force, but figure out where the fear came from and work with it. Saturn in the 8th house will teach you through transformations in different areas of life. Death is also a transformation, which means that if something in your life is over - do not rush to get upset, perhaps it's just a rebirth. Sex and all sorts of magical rites must be taken very seriously - do not do what you are not sure about, and the seriousness of which you do not understand. No liberties and actions at random - the consequences can be serious.9. SATURN IN THE 9TH HOUSE Saturn in the 9th house teaches us to take religion and religious matters seriously. If your Saturn has risen here, then you have something to work on this topic. Paying attention and strength to the topic of education is a must. Ideally, education is not on the knee, but serious and long. Plus, on the return of Saturn, there may be a chance of moving somewhere far away - take it as it is and do not resist - it's all for your good. If you are offered a move, and you resist and try to avoid it, you may end up in a situation where you simply have no choice. 10. SATURN IN 10 HOUSE If you have Saturn in the 10th house - feel free to go into politics, you have everything for this. Do not doubt directly. Plus, according to this position of Saturn, it is imperative to work out everything that is connected with the male half of your kind - relationships with your father, with your husband, and with other men in your life. If there are problems with marriage or with an already existing husband, then we go ahead and work out the relationship with Dad - it doesn\u2019t matter if he is alive or not - for sure. A job that will be connected with the state is suitable for you - some kind of civil service, business related to budget contracts, or government agencies - it will be just fine for you.11. SATURN IN THE 11TH HOUSE If you have Saturn in the 11th house, then on your return you may be tested by fame and fame. It doesn't even matter on what scale this fame or fame is - on the scale of your work team, on the scale of a small town, or a whole large country. Someone can flatter you or deceive you, cover up the truth with sweet speeches. Understand and understand, do not get fooled by flattery. All your friends and you yourself will pass this test. At the Saturn Return, your environment will be cleansed and repurified so that you see the truth. Only the best will remain for you. With such a Saturn, it would be nice to have your own business, growing up will go through him as well. Saturn will give you serious lessons about friends and business, take them seriously. Plus, if your Saturn is in the 11th house, be sure to take seriously the information on astrology that comes to you, and this science in general. Many astrologers known today began to practice astrology precisely during their Saturn return. Draw your conclusions) 12. SATURN IN THE 12TH HOUSE If your Saturn is in the 12th house, self-knowledge and self-development are your life's work. Learn to take seriously all the secret knowledge that comes to you, otherwise, you will still begin to take them seriously, only for this you will be shown the need for this so that you simply will not have a choice. Do it voluntarily and consciously. Any crime is contraindicated for you - you and your Saturn in the 12th house can rake in full even for the slightest misconduct, and if you also deliberately did it, you will have to accept punishment to the fullest extent of the law. A person with Saturn in the 12th house seems to be being watched by a personal invisible NIA officer. With such a Saturn, you can work in some kind of secret services, or closed enterprises, you can even end up in show business. In general, in areas where everything is decided secretly - this is your way. No attempts to give or take a bribe - you will be caught, 100%. An excellent study of Saturn in the 12th house is to write a book or a script for a TV project. ****************************** These are brief descriptions, I hope this will help you develop the right life strategy.

            "\u201cVisha\" is translated as \"snake-poison\", \"Kanya is a girl\".

They were beautiful, they knew how to sing and dance beautifully. From birth, they were given milk mixed with cobra venom. Growing up, the girl became Visha-Kanya - a \u201csnake woman\u201d. The priests of the goddess Kali sent the visha-Kanya to the camp of the enemy. The kiss of a visha-Kanya causes death of an enemy. A combination of planets called \"Visha Kanya Yoga\" in astrology In astrology, the term \"Visha-kanya\" means certain mutual combinations of planets in a woman's horoscope, indicating that the owner of the horoscope will bring misfortune to her husband. The effects of Vishakanya Yoga, according to the Parasara Hora Shastra, will be as follows: \"A woman will destroy her husband's family as well as her father's family, be barren or give birth to a dead child.\" The following remedies can naturalised the effects of Visha Kanya: it will be eliminated if the lord of the 7th house or a beneficent planet is located in the 7th house from the Lagna or moon. Visha-Kanya - \"poisonous maiden\" : such virgins served the kings as super-weapons. They were prepared from childhood, and it was done like this: little girls began to be fed poisons in low concentrations from childhood. When she reaches adolescence, she must pass the test: a fly that sits on her skin must die. If the test is passed, then no more poisons are given to her, and she gets down to business. It is enough for an objectionable guest to spend the night with such a so hat later nothing could save him. Presumably, it was this visha-kanya that caused the death of Alexander the Great. And in order not to conflict with karma, only those girls who, according to the horoscope, were supposed to become a widow, were selected for visha-Kanya combinations in the natal chart: Maharshi Parashara defines Vish-Kanya as any birth that takes place: \u2022 on Sunday, which coincides with Dvitya, when the Moon occupies the Ashlesha nakshatra. \u2022 on Saturday, which coincides with Saptami, when the Moon occupies the nakshatra of Krittika. \u2022 Tuesday, which coincides with Dvadasi when the Moon occupies the Shatabhish nakshatra. There are also the following combinations: \u2022 A girl will be a Visha Deva (Visha-Kanya) if there are two benefics in Lagna at the time of birth, one malefic in the 10th and two other malefics in the 6th house. \u2022Mars in the 9th, Saturn in Lagna and Sun in the 5th at the time of a girl's birth makes her a Visha kanya. Some authors expand the list of vara-tithe yogas of Visha-Kanya: \u2022 Sunday, which coincides with Dvadasi, when the Moon occupies the Shatabhisha nakshatra; \u2022 Tuesday, which coincides with Saptami, when the Moon occupies Vishakha nakshatra; The author of Jatakalankara states that three factors must be present to form these combinations: Birth: \u2022 in the nakshatras of Ashlesha, Krittika and Shatabhish, \u2022 on the days of the week - on Sunday, Saturday or Tuesday \u2022 in Bhadra tithi - Dvitya, Saptami and Dvadasi When yogas (1), (2) and (3) are combined (seemingly in any order), the combination of Visha-Kanya (\"poison girl\") occurs. The following was attributed to the results of visha Kanya: men who were born in these combinations would destroy their family and clan, and women would destroy their husbands. A category are two benefic planets in Lagna, one malefic in the 10th house and two malefics in the 6th house. \u2022 Birth must occur on Tuesday, Saturday or Sunday; on the 2nd, 7th or 12th lunar day (tithi). \u2022 Moon at the time of birth should be in Ashlesha, Krittika, Vishakha or Shatabhish nakshatras. Ex; Visha-Kanya (incomplete combination) This woman was born on Tuesday, on Dvadasi, Moon in Vishakha nakshatra. There is only one benefic (Jupiter) in the Lagna and no malefic in the 10th house, but two malefics (Sun and Mars) in the 6th house, including the 10th lord Mars. That is, these are incomplete conditions for the classical combination, but a variation.She works in the Ministry of Internal Affairs (exalted Jupiter in Lagna aspected by Mars). All her male relatives also worked in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. As a child, her father was killed, later her stepfather and husband were killed. Atma-karaka (\"planet of the soul\" or planet of personality) Rahu aspects Dara-karaka (planet - the significator of the spouse) Sun in the 6th house. Dara-karaka Sun is with Mars in the 6th house - husband and father (Sun) were policemen. Her Atma-karaka Rahu kills both of them, because Rahu Marrakesh positioned in 2nd house). Her 7th house has papa karatri yoga and 7th lord Saturn is in the 8th house from 7th with Rahu. Mars and Ketu creating papa kartari for the 7th are also badhakesas for Capricorn (7th) house. If we take the 7th house (Capricorn) as Lagna, the 11th house from it (Scorpio) becomes a badhak house, and Mars and Ketu are its co-rulers. Mercury is in the badhaka house for the 7th and is badhakesh for the 9th house (father). Therefore, her father and stepfather were killed during the period of Mercury, and her husband during the period of Ketu. Those who have Venus in the 12th from Lagna or in Arudha Lagna may lose their spouses. In the horoscope of a native, Venus is in Arudha Lagna on the 4th. Also, Jupiter in the 1st house is the owner of the 6th, which, on the one hand, speaks of its connection with law enforcement agencies (fighting enemies). And on the other hand, this speaks of the presence of her enemies, who can haunt her from a past life, unconsciously taking revenge on her.",

If the horoscope expert does not have proper knowledge of the results of these inauspicious yogas then the future of the native cannot be accurately analyzed. This inauspicious yoga in the horoscope is the deeds done by us and our ancestors. Many people have posed this question to me, why should we bear the fruits of the deeds done by our ancestors? Dear friends like our ancestors give us wealth, equity, land, property, etc. without hard work, in the same way, we also have to pay the fruits of their deeds. Astrologers ignore some inauspicious yogas in the horoscope due to which Raja Yoga is not coming to fruition and astrology is skeptical. Therefore it is necessary to pay special attention to Raja Yoga as well as the bad yogas of Kundali. The most deadly yoga in a woman's horoscope is Vishakanya Yoga. This inauspicious yoga is formed in a woman's horoscope. This yoga is capable of destroying the married life of a woman. The girl in whose horoscope this yoga is formed, her whole life is spent in struggles. Along with her married life, there is also a lack of child happiness. Native also had to suffer the loss of property. People who come in contact with her who are suffering from Vishakanya Yoga, their life gets busy and misfortune engulfs them. She is painful for her parents, siblings as well as in-laws. People born in Vishakanya Yoga are angry and bad-tempered and their husbands do not like them. Let's know when Visakanya Yoga is formed in a woman's horoscope. If Saturn is placed in the Ascendant in the horoscope of the woman, the Sun in the fifth house, and Mars in the ninth house, then 'Vishakanya' yoga is formed. If there are sinful and cruel planets in the seventh place in the horoscope of the woman, and if there are the sight of cruel or sinful planets on them, then Visakanya Yoga will be made. Shatabhisha Nakshatra, the day is on Sunday, the second date. If a woman's birth date or Vishakha or Shatabhisha Nakshatra is on Sunday, Dwadashi date. If a woman is born on Ashlesha or Visakha or Shatabhisha Nakshatra, the day is Tuesday, Saptami Tithi. If a woman is born on Ashlesha Nakshatra, day Saturday, second date. If a woman is born on Shatabhisha nakshatra, day Tuesday, Dwadashi date. If a woman is born on Kritika nakshatra, day Saturday, Saptami, or Dwadashi date. If there are one sin planet and two auspicious planets in the sixth place in the horoscope of a woman, then this Vishkanya Yoga makes. Jatiika born in Vishakanya Yoga advised that it is very important to take remedies before marriage. If the person who is suffering from Vishakanya Yoga gives sweet to anyone with her hands, then he becomes an enemy of that. If the Vishkanya of the female yoga is made sweet, give it to anyone with the help of someone else, then there will be no problem. If there is Visakanya Yoga in the horoscope of a woman, but if there is a seventh lord or auspicious planet in the seventh house from the birth lagna or moon lagna, then the defect caused by 'Visakanya' is removed. If the seventh house is in auspicious position and if the seventh house is aspected by the guru, then the 'Visakanya Dosh' is removed, but it is absolutely necessary to make the peace of the Vishakanya Yoga.",

It is an indication of past Karma, and the kind of family one is born into and early life experiences as a result. It enables our survival until we become self supporting away from parental controls. It is symbolic of the Jungian \"Personal Unconscious\" where memories of past lives are stored. The Sun position in a Birth Chart - by Sign, House, and Aspect relationships with other planets - shows what new Spiritual Lessons are being learned in this lifetime - which usually begins after age 30 when we are self supporting and more free to \"do our own thing\". It is usually discovered in things we do for Love rather than money. Evidence of this comes from the fact that after age 30 the physical body begins to deteriorate and people such as athletes are unable to compete with those younger. Also women are coming to menopause.Brian Baulsom MNFSH \u00b7 4yAstrology: How are Aquarius moons and Capricorn moons different and similar?EDIT : PLEASE SEE THE ADDED COMMENT WHICH CONFIRMS THE ACCURACY OF THIS. (Go to \u201cAdd comment\u201d and click on \u201cAll\u201d) Moon Signs are similar because they operate earlier in our lives, and describe our early childhood and parental upbringing. They especially describe the early influence of our mother. Our Sun Sign does not begin affecting us fully until we are away from parental control and have established our self in Society - and probably had children. This is after the first Saturn Return (to the position in our Birth Chart) at age 30. The Sun Sign may be compatible or incompatible with the Moon Sign YOUR PAST : MOON IN ARIES Your relationship with your mother would have given you a sense of independence and freedom. You are a born leader. YOUR PAST : MOON IN TAURUS Your relationship with your mother would have been such that she would have taught you many of the practical skills necessary to organise your life and finances. You are a born Business Manager. YOUR PAST : MOON IN GEMINI Your relationship with your mother would have been mentally stimulating. You may have been tutored at home. You are a born Scientist, Student, and Communicator. YOUR PAST : MOON IN CANCER Your relationship with your mother would have been quite close, and she would have shown you the benefits of a comfortable home and domestic security. She may have found it difficult to let you leave home. This is the Sign of \"The Mother\", and you will enjoy caring for yourself and others, especially children. Male or female, you are a bit of a \u201cmother hen\u201d. YOUR PAST : MOON IN LEO Your relationship with your mother would have given you a strong sense of self confidence. You are a born controller of other people at a personal or business level. YOUR PAST : MOON IN VIRGO Your relationship with your mother would have given you the need to attend to small details, especially daily chores. She was probably quite critical of what you did, and demanded perfection (even though it may not have been possible in a small child). Virgo is an Earth Sign, so this will have a practical basis. You naturally focus on your personal health, and could be a hypochondriac, or worry over unimportant matters. YOUR PAST : MOON IN LIBRA Your relationship with your mother would have been amicable, although not emotionally close - perhaps more like friends. You were born to seek close partnerships with others on a one to one basis. YOUR PAST : MOON IN SCORPIO Your relationship with your mother would have been rather distant. You would not know what she was thinking. You too would tend to be happier on your own. If upset she would withdraw emotionally rather than make a fuss. You have the same traits. Scorpio is concerned with emotional control that does not rush to make decisions until one has established the facts in the matter. You are a born Detective or Researcher. YOUR PAST : MOON IN SAGITTARIUS Your relationship with your mother might not have been that close, but it would have given you a strong sense of self confidence and freedom to explore life. She would prefer you to have some kind of individual Profession such as Law, Accountancy, or Medicine. You are a born Explorer of Foreign Lands, and Foreign Ideas and Beliefs. YOUR PAST : MOON IN CAPRICORN Your relationship with your mother would have been such that she would have encouraged you to achieve social status and have a career. You were born to \u201crise through the ranks\u201d a step at a time. YOUR PAST : MOON IN AQUARIUS Your relationship with your mother would have been somewhat distant because she would be very individualistic. More like friends than family. She may have divorced from your father when you are quite young. From being left to your own devices you would become independent at a young age. YOUR PAST : MOON IN PISCES Pisces refers to \"Service to Others\" and you would have been brought up to be helpful to the less fortunate. You will also have psychic abilities. Unfortunately you may not be discriminating about how you give help, and take on unnecessary burdens that are really there to help others learn their life lessons. Give a man a fish and he will be fed for a day. Give hin a net, and he will probably sell it to buy fish.",

The lunar sign of the zodiac what it says and how it will help you understand your emotions The lunar zodiac sign is one of the most important parts of the astrological profile: it characterizes your emotional side, feelings, intuition, and memory. It also identifies the main \"parenting factors\" and influences how you raise and care for others. Knowing your moon sign will help you understand your emotions and yourself in general. So, firstly, find out what you have, and then read what it all means. Aries Ruled by militant Mars, lunar Aries tend to be aggressive, impulsive and excitable. They want others to understand their needs on an intuitive level, even if Aries themselves cannot express them clearly in words. On a bad day, they can be especially temperamental and belligerent, but at their best, of times they are great at dealing with emotional problems (which makes them excellent advisers) and are ready to take risks, especially when it comes to love. Taurus The Moon is most accustomed to being in the sign of Taurus. Ruled by Venus (goddess of love, social good,s, luxury, and wealth), this sign is comfortable in mundane conditions. Sensitive and artistic to the core, Lunar Taurus are kind, respectful, and loyal to those they love. They enjoy every aspect of life to the fullest. In other words, Taurus e, at, drink, and party like no other zodiac sign. Gemini Those born under the sign of Gemini in the Moon understand their inner state when they speak about it out loud. As a rule, they tend to rationalize their feelings (after having a long discussion in advance to achieve clarity). Since Gemini is the only sign with a life partner in the sky (we are talking about Castor and Pollux from Greek mythology), lunar Gemini seeks relationships and resolves issues in a way that saves them. Cancer The Moon for Cancer is a natural patron. Operating on feelings, intuition, and memories, Cancer is especially comfortable indulging in nostalgia. Like cancer, in astrology, this feature symbolizes the ability of Cancers to look at the situation from the side. They cling to those they feel safe with and avoid the opposite. Lunar Cancers use their claws and shells to protect themselves from those around them if they take them out of their comfort zone. Leo All or Nothing: Leos in the Moon care for people with all the breadth of their souls, they love to show affection through grand gestures. Particularly generous gifts are received by those who support their fiery ego and allow them to be in the spotlight. And if someone encroaches on his territory, the Lion will growl and leave home. If he feels that he is loved, he remains forever.Virgo Ruled by Mercury, Lunar Virgos are in nature. They know how to be compassionate, to b,e patient and fair. However, if you take them to the emotional limit explode. The good that news is, Virgos on the Moon quickly stop being dramatic. They have earned a reputation for being critical, choosy, and fastidious, but only because they give their best to others and want the same high standards in return. Libra Those born under the sign of Libra in the Moon live a balanced life through companionship. Loyal and loving partners, they use charm and wit to express their feelings and generously bestow gifts on the people they adore. However, Libra is the only sign of the zodiac that symbolizes a non-living being (they are the scales of justice), which can make them critical, rational, and at times stingy with emotions. Scorpio Mars was traditionally considered the planetary ruler of Scorpio, but its modern ruler is Pluto. And this means that Scorpio radiates an intuitively strong, predatory, transforming energy. Known for their deep and brooding nature, Scorpio moons often turn to the world around them with a neutral expression, trying to hide their true - deep and passionate - feelings. They will only let people into their hearts when they are sure that they have complete trust in them. Sagittarius Lunar Sagittarius are considered lucky as they are ruled by the optimistic and risk-averse Jupiter. They like to be surrounded by exotic scents that pique their interest and philosophical intellectual conversations. Since this sign of the zodiac is armed (bow and arrows), if he is provoked, he will aim directly at the offender to fight back and protect himself. Capricorn Lunar Capricorn requires patience and perseverance both from himself and from those around him. Ruled by the foreman from astrology Saturn, the reflective and hardworking Capricorn achieves his own goals through perseverance. Success is of paramount importance to him, as he sees his inner self through earthly recognition. Capricorns businesslike attitude to life makes them take business very seriothey need to pay special attention to what brings them pleasure and relaxation. Aquarius The traditional planetary ruler of Aquarius is Saturn and the modern ruler is Uranus. Lunar Aquarians are comfortable in the process of exploration and a state of independence. Pioneers by nature, they, thanks to their extraordinary ideas, meet like-minded philanthropists along the way. Sometimes they can be arrogant, abandoning those who do not understand their way of thinking. Such Aquarians need a reliable and strong environment. Pisces Pisces Moons, ruled by majestic Jupiter and dreamy Neptune, are naturally creative and sentimental. Gentle and sensitive, this sign easily absorbs the emotions of others, which in itself can cause conflicting feelings. These people need to learn to separate fantasy from reality, as well as fact from fiction (even when it comes to memories) to swim freely and live a happy life."
