            "i suppose it depends what you mean by complete nonsense it ha been pretty categorically refuted and labelled a a pseudoscience ie it ha no founding basis or place in scientific rationale so if youre analysing it from a scientific perspective then thats just where it place and no one can change anyones view about that with that said if youre looking at astrology through a spiritual or intellectual lens it can be at the very least interesting rightly or wrongly people do take stock in thing of a spiritual nature and i think those who are drawn towards astrology or the power of celestial thing in general do so because while they dont connect with any kind of established or organised religion something within them is searching for more some people just dont want to live in a world where there nothing more than what we can sense objectively they dont want to live in a world without reason cause sense or meaning where we are born live meaningless life and die and crumble into nothing i personally also think astrology is total nonsense but i can see why it a comfort to those seeking a feeling of sense from the universe at large and for the most part the people i know who are interested in it arent harmful with it they just use it to bring them a sense of peace with that said i think there ha to be a point where it move from a spiritual interest into something more alarming people who make decision in their life based on astrology or people who pay money to astrologer to read their sign and take whats said very seriously rather than treating it a a hobby interest would worry me those people in my opinion dont posse the kind of robust rationale required to stay away from conspiracy theory or scam in general and personally i wouldnt be in a relationship with someone who believed in those thing to that extent because it would be so far removed from my understanding of sense that we would just not get along in the long term for me i view an interest in astrology in the same way i view people who enjoy awful romcom movie sometimes it nice to sit down and watch a trashy movie if you know it trash you can still enjoy it without taking it to heart and for me thats where astrology sits v say a nonfiction documentary on climate change but if i knew someone who watched romcoms all the time and believed that they were accurate and healthy blueprint for real life or relationship then well thats where it becomes problematic astrology can be an interesting exercise in flirting with idea that go beyond our understanding of the world while understanding it fictional and there always use in spiritual consideration even if they are proven to be scientifically nonsensical a long a you dont buy into it on a scientific level",
            "galileo father of modern science wa an astrologer astrology wa a necessary stepping stone to get to astronomy and astrology teach u many important thing about our planet namely the motion of the heaven predicts important factor on earth does the position of jupiter at your birth influence your personality no probably not does the position of the sun relative to the star predict when you should plant your crop absolutely yes it doe astrology had a hard time understanding the mechanic of these relationship and astrologer pieced together and tested a many conceivable variable a possible often getting it wrong and sometimes critically getting it right today we only remember their miss and we credit their win to a field of study that didnt exist at the time do you like knowing when the season will change and when to plant or harvest when the next full moon will be the period of comet do you like knowing which way north is do you like knowing how big the earth is or how far away the moon is the shape of our solar system all that work can arguably be attributed to astrology youre welcome",
            "while astrology ha no real theoretical basis and stuff like the position of star and planet will have an impact on your life ha little evidential support there is evidence that when a in the season you were born can impact your life somewhat ie httpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmc3777829 i believe the conclusion are mostly that people born in the winter have slightly worse life outcome the cause for this still seems to be unclear but at least some explanation focus on the fact that people born in the winter are exposed to different environmental condition than those that were born in other season so what im saying here is not that astrology is a fruitful area of study but that it might have accidentally stumbled on some real world connection",
            "so for the most part most people into astrology take it casually like a little fun thing or a fun hobby the way that someone might love those alignment dnd chart meme for your girlfriend i mean firstly like talk to her and ask lol reddit cannot read your girlfriend mind anymore than anyone else ask her have a genuine conversation and try to go in without bias how seriously doe she take it or doe she think it cool or doe she think it cool and it would be nice to move to x place anyway and it a nice excuse to start thinking about that but secondly she might take it seriously and in that case it not really any different than any other religion especially since astrology stem from a religion its something human have been doing for aeon to give reasoning for action we may do and may want to do maybe she take it a seriously a a religion which again talk to her",
            "so i am into astrology while dating a person who is not i do agree that there is some level of people taking advantage of human cognitive bias however modern day astrology is based on system that were created thousand of year ago a lot of people in india where my dad is from ha their own personal astrologer i think this is because of the social aspect of it i think it is a fun way to bond with people because it is a common hobby and often lead to fun more indepth conversation about other topic i wont claim that knowing about astrology stuff make me understand the answer of the universe more but i do find that it enriches my life i have had so many fun conversation that enriches my life due to knowing about astrology and i also find that people who enjoy astrology deeply are very analytical people in their own right i really enjoy those kind of people in every area of my life",
            "a logical reasoning ive heard is that astrology ha existed for thousand of year our ancestor wouldve been looking at the sky and associating pattern on earth with pattern up there take a saturn return for example saturn return to where it wa at your birth this doesnt mean saturn itself is influencing you this mean that people noticed every 2729 year saturn return and people seem to be really going through it in our modern era we associate the 1st saturn return with major growing up responsibility hard lesson and the 27 club the 2nd saturn return line up with the stereotypical midlife crisis even if you dont believe in astrology most people have anecdotal evidence pointing to those year of their life being incredibly challenging as for anecdotal evidence  i have a twin sister this mean that we have nearly the exact same natal chart if you put u next to each other wed seem like completely separate people we express ourselves differently dress differently and have incredibly different career path yet our natal chart show explain every single thing we do have in common the difference is in what we did with those inner working and i think thats where a lot of people get lost youre not a stagnant natal chart  you have a base plan the chart and what you do and how you act with that plan is up to you and the environment that surround you from an advanced astrological point  there is just too much history and study that ha gone into astrology to call it complete nonsense learn about astrology with a truly open mind and you can start to see the depth and the purpose things dont have to be empirical to be meaningful now to what youre getting at  pop astrology is absolute bullshit basing everything on your sun sign is silly although it is fun you say that astrology is nonsense can you tell me whats so nonsensical in trying to have a little fun in a world that seems to just get darker and darker doesnt is make sense that everyone should have something that brings them a little joy especially when it doesnt harm any one else bonus question point to the planet house and aspect on your natal chart that are making you feel resentment when other people are enjoying stuff",
            "your premise is unprovable because youre wanting an explanation for faith like saying cmv god doesnt exist view astrology like religion you dont have to believe in it for your girlfriend to enjoy it same a when an atheist and someone religious are together they can make it a point of contention or let each other live do the latter secondly the moon creates the tide on earth if it can pull that quantity of water it is possible it could pull blood to a different portion of the brain or affect development in some way the slight tilt of our planet cause enormous weather change season astrology and astronomy used to be one and the same not long ago if that isnt enough there is evidence of great chaos and war with the peak of each solar cycle",
            "one thought  we can agree that there are archetype of people whether you use the agreeablenessopennessextroversion etc model type a myers brings etcdoesnt matter what the name is if there are archetype of people could it not be the case also that gravitational field based on where planet and such are when you were born impact gene expression so a to bias you towards tending towards certain personality trait a you grow up",
            "the value in astrology if you can call it that is that because it vague and can apply to everyone reading something can give you a new perspective on something in life it get you to think and apply to your own situation for example this is my horoscope for today enjoy a spirited day in which you indulge in everything your heart desire gemini your imagination could take you to a whole new realm in which you play the starring role live these fantasy remember that if you can dream it you can do it so think big the fire inside you burn brightly so make good use of this power before it squandered away by someone else tugging on the string someone can be inspired by this and perhaps work on a creative project or just enjoy some alone time ps the impetus for creating this post is that i am casually dating someone that put real stock into their astrological reading and make actual life decision like where to live based on these what is the biggest decision that your partner ha made solely on the basis of a horoscope when you say where to live do you mean the horoscope told her to move inout of where she wa that day",
            "yeah i can imagine it is similar to the trick i use when i want to choose between two option and i am having trouble i flip a coin and then if i have a desire to reflip after i do it then i know i actually have a preference and go with the other option i am guessing the horoscope didnt actually tell her where to live it just helped her have a conversation with herself to make the decision where to live another place i use this tactic is at work if we have been talking around in circle about possible solution to the problem i will go ahead and make a formal proposal for a specific solution chosen somewhat at random once you have something written out it becomes much easier to have specific conversation about the what will actually happen if we follow the plan you need some starting point to work from and the actual accuracy of the starting point doesnt really matter a horoscope probably work just fine a a starting point",
            "exactly pure statistical noise might actually be the most helpful it unbiased uniformity prompt one to explore the widest gamut of possibility for one life that is it may actually be more useful in this exploitvsexplore sense than tailored information considering human tend to pick a mental rut and stick in it",
            "i personally dont buy into anything spiritual or supernatural about tarot card and reading but ive also personally used them for personal benefit for the same reason",
            "the zodiac is based on archtypes exploring archetype  be it astrology tarot mythology literature psychology jungian and more  develops our insight into human nature and can be a key tool in identifying our own pattern of behavior because it encourages selfreflection",
            "i read tarot and get so much from it a a psychological tool in fact it caused me to have more mental health breakthrough than therapy i never connected this to the way astrology work which im usually hugely skeptical of this ha actually changed my view and i think ill give it a bit more time from now on thanks",
            "while i dont believe in astrology i do believe birth month can have a vague general impact on personality at a young age there are usually cutoff that determine whether or not you will be slightly younger or older than your peer in school for example nhl player are most often born in the first quarter of the year theres a similar pattern in baseball being developmentally ahead or behind your peer can impact one personality in similar way granted these impact are broad and not everyones development is the same but it can lead to some effect where one would share more personality trait with those in their cohort",
            "my rational brain ha such a hard time understanding how people buy into religion it seems so clear to me religious value are vague enough to apply to everyone and that it is common for individual to seek out the piece that apply to them and ignore those that dont the only way i can remain openminded about this topic is to remind myself that i really dont understand the nature of reality or the mystery of human consciousness so i cant completely rule anything out can someone make a case for the validity of religion a anything more than complete nonsense im open to hearing anything",
            "exactly they are the same thing just one usually ha a dead guy a a central figure",
            "i always say that thing like astrology and a lot of other what i would call pseudo science are way to make sense of the natural chaos of the world if i wa looking for an investment banker and they told me they choose stalk based off of astrology that would probably set some red flag for most people but study show that the stock market is essentially random and any expert they could find didnt outperform choosing stock from a dart board so the astrologist investor wa responsible it really wouldnt matter how they made their choice so i learned to view these thing a basically a way to make sense in the world and a long a you dont ignore scientific fact or make really dangerous decision based of off your belief i basically think it fine to hold onto them",

            "not doing something you arent comfortable with is never a mistake you two dont sound compatible and he sounded a bit too excited  forward with thing before your first date ill be honest and say a guy sending me a dick pic would totally turn me off  especially if we havent even met yet he wa sending you super strong i want to hook up asap signal even though he acknowledged your want earlier marriagekids to be fair though this guy sound a bit silly some people cant communicate what they want even to themselves it isnt always outright lying or deception though he clearly did show you what he wanted his inability to communicate clearly circle back to him being a bit silly and immature if only men suddenly couldnt lie after 30",
            "i think i am the odd one out but maybe he just doe not think you connected sexually or were compatible sexually a well i broke up with someone because once we had sex i realized we wouldnt work out but you could argue that that could be realized before intercourse ",
            "honestly id say you need to choose one or the other like either make it clear you want a relationship before anything sexual happens or be sexual early on but you didnt want to do sexual stuff early on then when he sent you an unsolicited dick pic and essentially threatened to dump you if you didnt sleep with him you responded that youre only sexual in relationship and not with people you dont know well but then you gave in and slept with him on the very next date i just dont think that engenders a lot of respect i mean he definitely a jerk though sending an unsolicited dick pic and basically pressuring you into sex by prudeshaming you and threatening not to see you anymore dont sleep with guy who do that stuff theyre definitely only out for sex and dont respect you",

            "a lot of people lie to get what they want it not just a man thing some woman use sex a a tool to get love some men use love a a tool to get sex the early sign were there but when you are the one involved it is harder to see it but in the future a big warning is if the first time you see his unit is in a text messagerun",
            "i would have never had sex with this guy after what he said and sent he is clearly out for sex and will say anything to get it and the fact that such a total package is on hinge or any other dating app seeking anything but playing the field is too good to be true no matter what they claim i am always suspicious of these men and my suspicion usually get confirmed your friend are right do i need to be more sexually open in the first few date in order to be seen a fun do guy look for fun first and if the woman is fun enough then they consider keeping her around men seeking just sex yes if this is the type of person and relation you want then go ahead and push yourself beyond your own comfort level to accommodate to their need but there are other men who want both sex and a connection and arent pushy they arent usually on dating apps imo at least 95 of men on dating apps these day are looking just for casual sex regardless of what they claim and the remaining who want a relationship have something very offputting about them if i were you id try to meet men in person all my ex were men who were good people never pressured me for sex and ended up being my boyfriend who happily fulfulled my high libido in a committed relationship i met them all irl dont do anything that make you feel uncomfortable just to land a man",
            "they still do it although i dont really understand why im pretty open if i feel safe that i wont be beaten or killed and that no will be taken for an acceptable answer then i might bang nobody ha to trick me into it i have no idea why dude think they have to trick u into sex do i need to be more sexually open in the first few date in order to be seen a fun do guy look for fun first and if the woman is fun enough then they consider keeping her around i dont really think so i think you should do you and stay the way you are and dont try to get out of your comfort zone on this one thing because you want a partner someone to marry and have kid with and that should probably be someone who is about on the same level a you a far a when to have sex you dont want to seem especially appealing to someone who would just a soon ditch you if he think he not getting into your pant fast enough good grief it wa only three date ive dated people for three month and still wasnt interested in getting intimate but dont overestimate men over 30 some of em still play these stupid game instead of using their word like grown ups let them because theyll weed themselves out",
            "assholes are asshole at every age im sorry you found one",
            "im not sure if he wa lying per se but i do agree that you two sounded incompatible he wanted a more sexually fastpaced woman and you wanted a man who would go slower additionally the sex might not have been good for him hence the decision to on his part not to continue dont feel bad it just wasnt a good fit and you dodged a bullet",
            "i cant add any more to the comment about this guy character i do have a question for you one thing i look for on a date is doe she like me other than just going on the date what signal were you giving that he would know that you really liked him thought he wa physically attractive found him sexually desirable etc the last thing i want is to date someone that is ok with me but doesnt really find me super hot my experience is that sexual attraction doesnt increase  if you dont find me super hot in the first or second date youre not suddenly going to change later on and i dont want to date someone that doesnt find me hot i dont need another friend",

            "yes and if you are led to do so you should ask for the spiritual gift of discernment god operates on a need to know basis you do not need to be afraid of that gift the line between a demonic affliction sickness and trauma producing physical symptom in the body can get very blurry just because a spirit is hindering a person healing doesnt mean you simply get rid of it and the person is cured you have to continue to pray for healing which is not the same gift a discernment far a i can tell the gift of discernment is needed when people need to be confronted with the sin they did to let xyz spirit affect them and they usually dont know it most christians claim they are completely free of spiritual problem because god forgave them as they put their finger in their ear and try to shut you up",
            "yes i do think that demon still posse people if youre interested there is an episode of a podcast called pint with aquinas where the host interview a vatican exorcist about various exorcism that he performed on people the podcast is catholic i myself am not but i think that it a good listen from his testimony he say that demon possession is very much real and perhaps there is some degree of what we consider a mental illness that is actually demon possession however we should also be careful because i dont think and the exorcist say a much a well that mental illness  demon possession necessarily for example i have a friend who is a christian and ha a phd in some kind of psychology related to therapy and she practice it now we recently discussed demon possession and mental illness and she told me something similar she said that you can tell when someone is either dealing with some kind of demonic activity whether it is full on possession or perhaps the demon influence their thought she said that they tend to have a fixation on strange religious beliefsall of which deny that christ is the son of god 1 john 43 however much like anything you really have to handle the subject with much care if someone actually ha some kind of mental illness you should get them treatment that is appropriate throwing holy water on them may not be helpful if they arent demon possessed regarding why we dont see it a much in the world today presuming that you are from a somewhat secularized country is precisely because i think that the goal of demonic force is to make sure that you suffer the same fate a them as such if someone is an unbeliever in a secularized country and see a real legitimate demon possession this may drive them to faith since it is evidence of the supernatural however if you speak to missionary who go to place in rural africa india china or other place where folk spiritual belief are more common the rate of demonic activity and possession are higher there since these kind of thing can keep people in their unbelief not secular unbelief here a proof of the truth of the local folklore and some of these entity will terrorize people but without the power of god they are powerless to stop it unfortunately which is why we should support mission so that by bringing the light of the gospel to other dark place jesus will destroy the work of the devil 1 john 38 sorry for the wall of text but i hope that it helpful",
            "my thought are on this are that yes it happens but it more subtle today than it wa shown to be in the bible carl jung ha a quote saying that people dont have idea idea have people and i think that best encapsulated today demonic possession its not just like one day youre walking along and poof you get possessed it take time arrogance the inability to say your idea are wrong and even the obsession with an idea and little by little your soul get chipped away until you are nearly nothing but the idea or demon in this case that have completely consumed you",

            "this wa definitely done to highlight the inequality between the wealthy and the poor of wizarding family especially the scenario in year two when draco basically bought his way onto the team i agree it gave harry an advantage at hogwarts and im sure it standardized in some capacity at the professional level but at the school age level it almost the same a muggle student using the newestmost advanced aluminum baseball bat while others are left with a 30 year old bat that isnt nearly a good",
            "harry didnt buy either of his broom so his wealth didnt matter there but i agree a firebolt is a drastic advantage and unfair",
            "i lost count of how many time ive said this but i kinda hate that harry got a firebolt because a soon a he doe almost every single match is written in a way that show he won because he had the faster broom harrys supposed to be a good player we are told harry is a good player but after he get the firebolt there a bunch of match where he wasnt even paying attention to the snitch hears someone else saying the other team seeker is after the snitch turn around and still is able to get there first because his broom is better heck the book even make a point of throwing in comment like their broom wa no match for the firebolt i hate it i dont know why jk rowling decided to write the match that way it make it seem that it doesnt matter if harry is good or not he gonna win anyway cause he ha the best broom",
            "thats what i always thought i see some people comparing it to better skate or goal pad which dont make a huge difference but i think that those are more an extention of the player whereas the broom is essentially a vehicle and doe most of the work and so i think it more comparable to motor sport it would be like giving a formula 2 or 3 driver access to a formula one car of course you would already need to be a pretty good driver to even get behind the wheel of an f1 car and not crash it a it is a very difficult car to drive im sure the same is true with a high end broom and no of course having a better car isnt a shoe in but it sure give them a huge advantage that especially if they are already an exceptional driver a harry is an exceptional flyer firebolt or not they can take and out preform thier competitor by a much wider margin than if they were in the same car or on the same broom even if they are at a similar skill level know what i mean im not saying that every student need to have the exact same broom but there need to be some regulation some margin of speed agility and price that the broom need to fit into and a broom like the firebolt should just be straight illegal in a high scool match",
            "i disagree i do however think you have a point i think rowling could have potentially made the skill floor higher on the firebolt like you have to be a really really good flyer to operate it i think it reasonable to allow fast racing broom considering the 260 seems like a common enough broom and it still like a top 10 or so broom by the end of the series plus harper or whatever get to the snitch faster than harry in gryffindor v slytherin in year 6 riding presumably a 2001 so imo it seems like the broom can only get you so far that being said it suggested in the 3rd that the firebolt is on another level",
            "i think that there should be a broom nothing too expensive but at least decent allocated to each player on the quidditch team for tryout the broom of the player who arent currently on the pitch can be used its not like hogwarts wa a poor school it wa based in a castle ffs when you are taken off the team or you graduate etc your broom go to the new player assuming it is still in good condition but an agreement is made between you and the headteachermadame hooch before you get your broom in regard to what happens if it get damaged etc if the broom is damaged beyond repair it is up to the owner a buy a new one of course there the issue of what happens if a family cant afford to buy the same model after it is broken well thats where the agreement with the head come in naturally you can choose go buy yourself a better broom and use that but at least everyone ha an acceptable broom now",
            "devils advocate if any of the student wanted to go on to be professional quidditch player they would be woefully unprepared to perform at that level unless the standardization would be for all of the student to have the newest broom on the market which wouldnt be a likely policy",
            "since i played hockey i always compared stick to broom you can buy a wooden stick for 40 or you can buy a onepiece composite for 300",
            "i guess the main question is how much doe the broom itself impact the player can player perform generally the same no matter the broom im torn on this one as someone who grew up playing competitive sport i dont see any issue in someone splurging for higher quality equipment if they can afford it for example growing up hockey wa my primary sport and i would get high quality gear to play in hockey i played a a goalie and you can argue that lighter higher quality pad will give you an advantage over heavier lower quality pad theres weight reduction more attention to detail to allow you to slide better or recover to your foot quicker that said physical ability of the player will have a much greater impact on the performance of that player on the other hand ive never flown on a broom and dont know how much of the speed on a broom is dictated by the broom itself compared to the person riding it i assume that broom quality will have a much larger influence on performance compared to goalie pad however that is under the assumption that physical ability of the person riding the broom have minimal impact on performance",

            "dude ive been rereading and on the 5th one now its like ever since ive started everything posted on this sub is exactly what i wanted to say",
            "do we have standard bicycle in the real world it may seem unfair but this just show how the wizard world is not very different from our world",
            "ya this ha always kinda bothered me i also think there should be more specialized broom like a racing broom shouldnt be ideal for quidditch and a keeper should have a different broom than a seeker",
            "i think about the broom a lot it seemed a though jkr nerfed harrys to some extent in certain scene year three playing against slytherin malfoy wa able to catch up to harry long enough to actually grab his broom and hold onto the tail same year against ravenclaw cho wa able to block harry and wood tell him to knock her off her broom the firebolt is supposed to be the fastest broom to date and still these two are able to easily catch and distract him but when we first get introduced to the firebolt in diagon alley it mentioned that the firebolt easily outstrips the nimbus series but a wide margin so why were the two opposing seeker able to catch harry so easily",
            "i always see quiditch a a sort of symbolic play within the story harry the seeker having to find the elusive snitch just like the elusive horcruxes later on the difference in broom quality isnt the only obviously unfair part of quiditch its kind of insane that the team who seeker catch the snitch first get this huge amount of point its almost impossible to win without getting the snitch the ireland  bulgaria match being the exception that prof the rule i might be overanalyzing but to me this highlight the crucial role harry played in the antivoldemort movement sure everyone could try and resist and fight or score goal and hit bludgers but in the end only harry could end the game and win he wa the only one who could kill voldy so yea i view the difference in broom a just another symbol of the inequality in the wizarding world",
            "yes there have been quite a few occasion when the other seeker ha actually spotted the snitch and dived and harry only get it because of his firebolt is faster seems pretty unfair i also never really understood why draco bought his way onto the team i mean he wa a pretty decent player anyway not a good a harry but still a good seeker he should have just tried out in second year and then offered the new broom maybe lucius didnt think he would get in on talent alone",
            "how do we know it because the firebolt is faster and not because harry is a good flyer he did make the team and become a top seeker a an 11 year old",
            "ya ive always thought this wa unfair do you think that all professional quidditch player had the latest model a soon a it came out though cause if not thats even worse",
            "too bad there no wisdom stat p intelligence is knowing how to play the 1812 overture with your pit wisdom is knowing its not the time to do it"
