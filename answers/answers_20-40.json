The dwarves in the story are not real people. Like most of the characters, they are stereotypes and the stories are parables meant to instill a moral teaching. I do agree that Disney shouldn\u2019t be remaking it just to cash in and make themselves woke and PC. There\u2019s lots of stories in African, Asian or Native American cultures, for example, that I\u2019m sure would be extremely interesting and would rightfully be cast with non white actors. Apart form the fact that you can go the third way and actually invent new stories and characters that can be of any colour or ethnicity. The problem is the laziness needs to stop, both on behalf of the writers, directors, producers who, given the salaries that most of them earn, should wrack their wee brains a bit for some inspiration or get out and let some new people try to bring new ideas to the cinema screen; and also on behalf of the Righteous Indignant mob who see and take offence at every possible thing, even when it\u2019s been around for ages. Blackwashing every white story won\u2019t help diversity or inclusiveness. It just plays into the bastardisation of cultures, all of them: the white ones (White cultures exist in the plural just like Black or Asian cultures exist in the plural, BTW) and the others. Call me crazy but I see a concerted effort to do away with individuality and diversity, a tendency to melt all of humanity into a golden skinned, asexual, agendered, unethnic mass where we\u2019re so equal, we\u2019re literally the same and there\u2019s no culture or ethnicity but human culture and human ethnicity. If it comes to this, we will all have lost. Please, Peter, think about what you have in front of your eyes and use your intelligence to analyse it. Yes, the film shouldn\u2019t be made but it\u2019s much bigger (no pun intended) than you or me or the actress that is said to be cast as Snow White.",

I\u2019m not a dwarf myself and I can imagine he feels frustrated at what he perceives as Disney being insensitive to people like him. I don\u2019t see it myself. Would a Red Riding Hood movie with a werewolf instead of a normal wolf therefore be discriminatory to furries by suggesting bipedal animals are all dangerous monsters when all the furries want to do is have weird sex? Does Ariel wearing sea shells on her chest mean she supports making sea creatures homeless because she robbed or murdered some poor clam to get them? Did Beauty and the Beast therefore mock people with hypertrichosis? People are always looking for something to be offended about. When they\u2019re always looking, they\u2019ll always find something. In truth, I think views on dwarf actors began to change long before Peter Dinklage came about when Warwick Davis starred in Willow. His character was smart and powerful despite his small stature and made a great deal of positive change in his world. Peter Dinklage is a talented actor and has continued to represent dwarfs in film. I think getting offended over Snow White and the Seven Dwarves is a bit silly. I mean, we could also argue it\u2019s more ignoring history since Snow White had \u2018skin as white as snow, lips as red as the red apple\u2019 and they picked a part-Colombian actress (who is very beautiful of course) to portray her who is certainly not as pale as snow.But while we\u2019re getting offended, should we yell at Disney for being \u2018woke\u2019 and changing a traditionally European story by making the main actress be non-German? Of course not. Remember what I said above about it being a fantasy story? We\u2019re not pretending historical personalities were black when they weren\u2019t. We\u2019re diving into a fantasy land, that doesn\u2019t exist, which is populated by magical creatures. So who really cares? End Opinion: Everything has to be a big deal to somebody. Other End Opinion: Peter Dinklage has the same freedom to express his views as anyone else even if I don\u2019t see eye to eye on them.",

I think he just finds it offensive because they are (or might be) using people with dwarfism to represent fairy tale dwarves, thus conflating the two. Did he feel the same about the dwarves in the lord of the rings who were just portrayed by normal sized actors? That is a question one would have to ask him. While he is very prominent, he is only one man with one opinion. Other people in his community have very different opinions on the issue. There are other actors with dwarfism that have made good careers taking parts where their size was an asset, not a liability. Warwick Davis paved the way for Dinklage with rolls like Willow. Other actors who have not had the opportunity to become famous with major roles on Game of Thrones would be lucky to get a staring role in a Disney film. There is a little hypocrisy there. His most famous role, Tyrion Lannister, was defined by dwarfism. It was a role that he was able to get because he was a dwarf, and it likely would have gone to someone else if the character had not been written as a dwarf. And for all of Tyrion\u2019s depth, much of his personality was about being a dwarf. Either for how people saw him or how he overcame it. I disagree with his opinion, but I am not going to die on a hill fighting him over it.",
            "It's kind of hard not to see the guy's point.

            "The colonists fought the American Revolution for several reasons, including opposition to British taxation policies, lack of representation in the British Parliament, restrictions on westward expansion, and general dissatisfaction with British rule.

I will also focus on some other issues though. This is going to be a very in-depth answer, so I hope you have the patience to stick around.  1763 You see, before 1763, British administration of the American colonies was very hands-off, and the colonies were allowed large degrees of autonomy, with most state functions (including taxation) being delegated to local assemblies such as the Virginia House of Burgesses. After the end Seven Years War in 1763, the new Prime Minister George Grenville had three major issues to deal with. 1. How to defend Britain\u2019s overseas holdings.2. How to check the colonists\u2019 unceasing claims on Native American lands.3. How the fuck are we supposed to get money? The plan for point one was to have British regular troops man a line of forts from Canada to Florida, to protect the colonies from enemies on all sides. While this was ostensibly for the colonists\u2019 protection, the colonists themselves felt like the troops were more of an occupation force. Their thought process was \u201cWell, we just won a war against the French, so the biggest threat to us is gone. Now you station troops in our lands?\u201d The whole thing reeked of despotism, and the colonists didn\u2019t like it one bit. The second point was addressed by George III, who announced the Proclamation Line of 1763, which was a line drawn down the Appalachian Mountains. It restricted the colonists to the east side, and left the western side to the American Indians. Unfortunately, all this really did was stir up resentment for Britain, as land was becoming a rarer and more expensive commodity in the colonies.The third point was the big one. Britain had accumulated over \u00a3120,000,000 in debt by the end of the war with the French. Grenville needed to pay for this somehow, so he resolved to raise taxes on the people of the empire. At this point, he did not tax the colonists too hard; he merely thought that they should send more tax back to the mother country than the meager amount they were currently paying in tax to the central government. So the Prime Minister passed the Sugar Act.  1764 The colonists had been evading the six pence duty on molasses by bribing the agents who were supposed to monitor it with one and a half pence, so they would keep quiet. Grenville thought that by cutting the tax in half, that the colonists would be encouraged to use their money for paying the tax, rather than bribing the agents tasked with collecting it. They were not expecting any sort of pushback whatsoever. They were wrong in this assumption. The formerly lax tax collectors were replaced with incorruptible and diligent agents. This made the bribery (yes, the colonists still planned to do that) nearly impossible, and the colonists were stuck with paying twice what they used to be able to bribe the tax collectors with. On top of this, the Sugar Act reached the colonies during a post-war economic recession. This further angered the colonists who had little money to spare. The colonists began urging Parliament to repeal the Act. Some did so on purely economic terms, but others began arguing that Parliament did not have the right to tax the colonies, because the colonists were not represented in Parliament. The idea that your property should not be unjustly taxed went all the way back to the English Civil Wars. Where property rights existed, there was liberty. Where property rights did not exist, tyranny reigned. The colonists believed that they had the right to not be unfairly taxed, because, after all, they were proud Englishmen.  1765 Grenville\u2019s ministry didn\u2019t really pay much attention to the opposition, and decided to go ahead with phase two of their revenue plan: the Stamp Act. It was a tax on paper. The paper would be distributed by officials from Britain, and it was required that most printed materials would be printed on the stamped paper. The act was scheduled to take effect November 1, 1765. Opposition to this Act was strong, however, and dissidence rang throughout the Thirteen Colonies. In the Virginia House of Burgesses, Patrick Henry made his first appearance on the revolutionary stage with a vehement speech opposing Parliament\u2019s taxes, and the next day, the Virginia Resolves were passed by the House of Burgesses. They stated, as follows: > 1. Resolved, that the first adventurers and settlers of His Majesty's colony and dominion of Virginia brought with them and transmitted to their posterity, and all other His Majesty's subjects since inhabiting in this His Majesty's said colony, all the liberties, privileges, franchises, and immunities that have at any time been held, enjoyed, and possessed by the people of Great Britain.2. Resolved, that by two royal charters, granted by King James I, the colonists aforesaid are declared entitled to all liberties, privileges, and immunities of denizens and natural subjects to all intents and purposes as if they had been abiding and born within the Realm of England.3. Resolved, that the taxation of the people by themselves, or by persons chosen by themselves to represent them, who can only know what taxes the people are able to bear, or the easiest method of raising them, and must themselves be affected by every tax laid on the people, is the only security against a burdensome taxation, and the distinguishing characteristic of British freedom, without which the ancient constitution cannot exist.4. Resolved, that His Majesty's liege people of this his most ancient and loyal colony have without interruption enjoyed the inestimable right of being governed by such laws, respecting their internal policy and taxation, as are derived from their own consent, with the approbation of their sovereign, or his substitute; and that the same has never been forfeited or yielded up, but has been constantly recognized by the kings and people of Great Britain.5. Resolved, therefor that the General Assembly of this Colony have the only and exclusive Right and Power to lay Taxes and Impositions upon the inhabitants of this Colony and that every Attempt to vest such Power in any person or persons whatsoever other than the General Assembly aforesaid has a manifest Tendency to destroy British as well as American Freedom.  The Virginia Resolves (coming from the largest and most influential colony) circulated throughout the colonies during the summer, and many colonies passed similar resolves. The first signs of colonial unity began to show. In Massachusetts, the opposition took a more violent approach. An effigy of a stamp distributor was hanged from a tree, and when a sheriff tried to take it down, he was stopped by an angry mob. That night, a shoemaker led a crowd down to the stamp distributor\u2019s offices by the docks. They smashed the offices to splinters. Then they went down to the distributor\u2019s home, carrying the effigy. They beheaded it in front of the house, and then stamped it into the ground (hahaha, these guys are a riot). They then smashed up the distributor\u2019s house, before retiring for the night. The next day, a delegation from the mob contacted the stamp distributor and said \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just resign?\u201d and the distributor said \u201cYeah, I think that would be good.\u201dIn August, the mob reconvened. They managed to get themselves very drunk, and decided to attack the house of the local governor, Thomas Hutchinson. They gave it the same treatment as they did to all the other houses they systematically dismantled. The destruction, however, was highly organized and disciplined. This stoic opposition to a law that wasn\u2019t even going into effect for months shocked and startled the politicians back in Britain. Grenville was replaced by Lord Rockingham as Prime Minister in July, and Rockingham quickly started looking for a way out from under the policies of Grenville. In October, the Stamp Act Congress met in New York City, with delegates from nine of thirteen colonies in attendance. They met to discuss a joint response to both the Sugar and Stamp acts. They concluded that Parliament did not have the right to levy \u201cinternal taxes\u201d (taxes to raise revenue), but that they did have the right to levy \u201cexternal taxes\u201d (taxes to regulate trade). At the same time that the Stamp Act Congress was meeting, the first signs of non-importation were brewing. Non-importation agreements would grow to become a crucial building block of colonial opposition to Britain. Parliament convened in December, but while they wanted to repeal the Stamp Act itself, they also wanted to assert their right to tax the colonies however they saw fit.  1766 By February, they had reached a decision. They repealed the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act, but they also passed the Declaratory Act. It stated that \u201c[Parliament] ought to have full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects of the crown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever.\u201d Only a few colonial leaders really saw what the Declaratory Act foreshadowed. Mostly, celebrations for the repeal of the Stamp Act ran rampant throughout the colonies. In the first major showdown between the colonies and Britain, the colonies had won.  1767 Back in July of 1766, Rockingham had been dismissed as Prime Minister, and replaced by William Pitt, a strong advocate for the colonies. But Pitt was old, and frequently absent from Parliament. So his divided ministers battled it out for control. The most influential among them was Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend. He used his position to pass what are now called the Townshend Acts. These were actually five interconnected bills, but the most important to the American colonies was the Revenue Act. It stipulated import duties on commodities such as lead, paper, printer ink, glass, and tea. If you recall, the Stamp Act Congress had conceded that Parliament had the authority to levy external taxes for regulating trade: exactly the kinds of taxes stipulated in the Revenue Act. Well, turns out they were just saying that. A Board of Customs was formed to enforce the paying of these taxes, so even more British agents would be running around in the colonies (something the colonists had shown their dislike for). On top of that, the government agents would be paid with the revenue from the duties, rather than by the colonial assemblies. Before, the colonies had been able to exert a degree of influence over the agents, (they were paying them, after all) but not anymore. Charles Townshend himself would not live to see the blowback to his Acts, however, as he died in September 1767. The power vacuum left by his death was filled by some guy who you don\u2019t need to know about because he\u2019s not important. Opposition in the colonies was slow to get started as I mentioned, as everyone was still weary from the opposition to the Stamp Act. Opposition was somewhat muted, as the Stamp Act riots had been exhausting to the colonists and they didn\u2019t have much energy to continue resisting. However, John Dickinson\u2019s Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, which began circulation in December, gave the colonial opposition a second wind. The letters reinforced the idea that Parliament did not have the right to tax the colonists at all, internal or external.  1768 By February, Samuel Adams had been able to drum up enough support in the Massachusetts House of Representatives to push through a petition to Britain to repeal the Revenue Act. He followed this up with a Circular Letter to the other colonies, urging them to send similar petitions to Parliament. While the news of the Circular Letter was making its way to Britain and back, the Board of Customs launched a series of attacks on John Hancock, both of which backfired. First, they sent an agent onboard one of his ships to search it. He went below deck where his search warrant did not extend; thus, he was thrown off the ship by Hancock, and his actions were upheld by a local court. The second attack was when the Board seized one of his ships and held it on a technicality. When the Navy tried to move the ship out of port, a mob coalesced and managed to stop Hancock\u2019s ship from being taken away. The mob, like the one during the Stamp Act Riots, was disciplined and under control. Back in Britain, news of the Circular Letter finally reached Britain. The new Colonial Secretary had no way of knowing that affairs in Boston had already progressed to organized mob violence. He ordered the governor, Francis Bernard, to order the House of Representatives to rescind the Circular Letter or be dissolved. The House of Representatives voted 92\u201317 not to rescind. Bernard, in turn, dissolved the House. The merchants of the colonies were starting to get pretty pissed about the new taxes and custom agents, and they began discussing a new non-importation agreement. However, each city was afraid to make the first move, because they feared that if they did, that business would simply move down to the next city who didn\u2019t join the agreement. Non-importation, it seemed, was an all or nothing kind of deal. Massachusetts proposed the first successful non-importation pact on August 1, which was to commence on January 1, 1769. New York and Pennsylvania quickly followed suit, and Rhode Island signed on too, with a little \u201cpersuasion-not-a-trade-embargo.\u201d Remember the mob violence that took place over John Hancock\u2019s seized ship? Well, the administration in Boston had called 4000 troops down from Halifax to keep the mob under control. The Massachusetts Assembly tried to reconvene, but were shut down by the governor. An unofficial convention of towns met in Boston a week later, to try to urge the governor to reconsider. It was ineffective however, and on October 1, British soldiers began disembarking onto the docks of Boston. The radicals in Boston decided to cease overt resistance, but there was still resistance. That was evidenced by the fact that the soldiers could find no one willing to rent them lodgings. It took them weeks to get suitable winter quarters in some leased warehouses.  1769 In Boston, tensions continued to boil between the civilians and the loitering soldiers, who were a constant pain in the neck for the commoner in Boston. They did all the things that soldiers do: get drunk, flirt with the girls, etc. All they did was stir up further resentment among the colonists for the central government in London. In the rest of the colonies, the non-importation agreement adopted last year was expanded to Virginia, and thus the rest of the southern colonies. George Washington (yes, that George Washington) and George Mason helped push the pact through the Virginia House of Burgesses. The Townshend Acts, like the Stamp Act before them, seemed to be becoming more trouble than they were worth.  1770 In January, George III finally relieved that one guy whose name doesn\u2019t matter of his duties as Prime Minister, and replaced him with Lord North, who had previously been Chancellor of the Exchequer. This guy will be around for a while, so I no longer have to try to stick in awkwardly worded paragraphs about British politics. In Boston, an 11-year-old boy had been shot and killed in February, and a crowd of thousands turned out for his funeral, which was more a show of political force than in memorial to the boy. Over the next few weeks, tensions rose rapidly, with fights between civilians and soldiers a common sight on the street. On March 5, the culmination of months of frustration, anger, and brewing enmity finally took place. The Boston Massacre. A sentry named Hugh White was talking with some of his comrades near the Customs House, when a civilian made a joke about his commanding officer. He punched the guy in the face, and his comrades ran off, leaving him to deal with the mob himself. He backed up against the Customs House with his gun drawn. Captain Preston of the Customs House garrison quickly saw that the situation would not resolve itself, and led his eight soldiers through the crowd. He had them form a semicircle facing the crowd. Guns drawn. For fifteen minutes, taunts, heckling, snowballs, and ice rained down on the soldiers, who were growing more and more jumpy by the moment. Finally, a private at the end of the line was hit, slipped on ice, and when he pulled himself back up, he fired his musket into the crowd.The whole group of soldiers was soon firing into the crowd. 11 men were hit; five died, and six were wounded. The mob fell back, but was only dispersed when Thomas Hutchinson, the acting governor, promised a full inquiry, and Preston and his men were arrested the next morning. John Adams defended the soldiers in court, and he got almost all of the soldiers acquitted with his eloquent defense. A propaganda war was waged between the conservative and radical presses in Boston, each trying to spin the story to suit their own ends. The Townshend Acts were finally repealed in April 1770. However, Parliament opted to leave the duty on tea in effect. This was to keep in place the precedent that Parliament could, should, and would tax the colonists whenever they saw fit. This was a nice impasse, really. The colonists were free of Britain\u2019s incessant money grubbing, and Parliament maintained their right to tax the colonies. This ushered in a period of relative calm.  1771 Not much to say here. Non-importation ceased, and both sides of the crisis seemed to think that this was the beginning of a return to normalcy.  1772 Nothing to report until June, when a ship called the Gaspee ran aground while chasing smugglers off the coast of Rhode Island. A mob of patriots quickly boarded the ship, seized it by force, and burned it. This was a sign that hostilities had not yet ceased. Remember when Parliament took the right to pay the governors away from the colonial assemblies? Well, that hadn\u2019t been repealed with the rest of the Townshend Acts, and later that year, Parliament decided to expand this to all the judges in the colonies. The colonists were, of course, enraged at the judiciary becoming a mere puppet of the Crown. Committees of Correspondence were again formed to discuss a response.  1773 In January, Thomas Hutchinson started off the year by making things ten times worse. He made inflammatory declarations that Parliament\u2019s authority was supreme, that the Committees were completely wrong and should never have convened, and, most significantly of all, he said that \u201cno line can be drawn between the supreme authority of Parliament and total independence of the colonies.\u201d See, he thought that independence was so absurd even to the most radical of radicals that the supreme authority of Parliament would be the only logical option left to them. However, all he did with this statement was legitimize the small independence movements beginning to take shape.

Those on top remained safely on top and the system developed insured that too. Democracy if needed not not too much democracy. Why they fought? Certainly not out of some love for enlightenment ideals. Maybe to avoid debts to British lenders, to stop any ideas against slavery, to be able to trade outside the Empire unhindered, to gain access to lands given to the King\u2019s Native allies after 1763, to oppose the generosity of the British towards His Majesty\u2019s Catholic subjects, to replace appointments from London to appointments in government locally\u2026.the list goes on.

The operation was meant to be conducted as discreetly as possible since scores of British troops were hiding out in the Massachusetts countryside. Paul Revere is best known as the Boston [ https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/boston-massachusetts ] silversmith immortalized in the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem describing the Patriot's midnight ride to warn about a British attack. But that 1775 ride (which wasn't exactly as Longfellow described) is only one chapter in Revere's role in the American Revolution [ https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/american-revolution-history ]\u2014and in his long life. Here are 10 facts about the colonial hero. 1. He was of French extraction. Paul Revere\u2019s father, Apollos Rivoire, was a French Huguenot who immigrated to Boston at age 13 and Anglicized his family name before marrying a local girl named Deborah Hitchbourn. Born around 1734 and one of 11 or 12 children, Paul never learned to read or speak French, though he did fight against Apollos\u2019 former compatriots during the French and Indian War [ https://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/french-and-indian-war ]. 2. A silversmith by trade, he sometimes worked as an amateur dentist. Revere used his skills as a craftsman to wire dentures made of walrus ivory or animal teeth into his patients\u2019 mouths. In 1776 he unwittingly became the first person to practice forensic dentistry in the United States: He identified the body of his friend Joseph Warren nine months after the well-known revolutionary died during the Battle of Bunker Hill [ https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/battle-of-bunker-hill ] by recognizing wiring he had used on a false tooth. Contrary to popular legend, Revere did not fashion a set of wooden dentures [ https://www.history.com/news/did-george-washington-have-wooden-teeth ] for George Washington [ https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/george-washington ]. 3. He was also known for his art. When he wasn\u2019t smithing or dabbling in dentistry, the multitalented Paul Revere produced some of the era\u2019s most sophisticated copper plate engravings, creating illustrations used in books, magazines, political cartoons and tavern menus. One of his most famous engravings is a sensationalized and propagandist depiction of the 1770 Boston Massacre [ https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/boston-massacre ], based on a painting by the Bostonian artist Henry Pelham. Its widespread distribution helped to fuel [ https://www.history.com/news/paul-revere-engraving-boston-massacre ] growing resentment [ https://www.history.com/news/american-revolution-causes ] toward the British army and government. 4. He led a spy ring. According to the Central Intelligence Agency, Paul Revere founded the first patriot intelligence network on record, a Boston-based group known as the \u201cmechanics.\u201d Prior to the American Revolution he had been a member of the Sons of Liberty [ https://www.history.com/news/sons-of-liberty-members-causes ], a political organization that opposed incendiary tax legislation such as the Stamp Act [ https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/stamp-act ] of 1765 and organized demonstrations against the British. Beginning in 1774, the mechanics, also referred to as the Liberty Boys, spied on British soldiers and met regularly (in the legendary Green Dragon Tavern) to share information. 5. The well-known poem about him is inaccurate. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow\u2019s 1861 poem about Paul Revere\u2019s ride got many of the facts wrong. For one thing, Revere was not alone on his mission to warn John Hancock [ https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/john-hancock ], Samuel Adams [ https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/samuel-adams ] and other patriots that the British were approaching Lexington on the evening of April 18, 1775. Two other men, William Dawes [ https://www.history.com/news/the-midnight-ride-of-william-dawes ] and Samuel Prescott, rode alongside him, and by the end of the night as many as 40 men on horseback were spreading the word across Boston\u2019s Suffolk County. Revere also never reached Concord, as the poem inaccura...",

            "He said the regulars were coming. He DID NOT say the British were coming because everyone was already British, residents of a British colony.",
            "Actually the question is incorrect ! The American Colonies were British. This meant that the people there by definition were subjects of the British Crown. An often overlooked point is that the population was divided into three basic groups: People that supported the UK Crown. People that wanted independence. And the majority by a very large margin were the people that did not care either way and just wanted to get on with life. So as I say legally Revere, Washington and the rest were rebelling against the lawful government at the time thus could not have been patriots"

Because of his inability to take ownership of his actions and his absolutely pathological capacity for doubling down, his supporters now live in a type of MAGA land rather than in the real world. It's a landscape so fundamentally warped that trump's supporters believe liberal organisations like the FBI and CIA are made up nearly entirely of people who just want to harm their hero and, consequently, themselves. Republicans, regardless of their opinions of the ex-president, appear to have little choice but to publicly defend trump in the face of any legal responsibility.

But if you drill a little deeper there\u2019s a better, more nuanced answer to the question. Albert, routinely performed well, finishing in the top of his class in his early life as a student. In what equated to High School for him, he finished second overall in his class. He scored either five or six out of a possible six in his main courses and a three in his French class, which he made no bones about not enjoying. In his Zurich entrance exam, an important test to a prestigious university, he did well on most sections, *(except for French). He scored the highest in Math, and of course in Physics, he was at the top, finishing in half the allotted time. At University, he scored five out of six overall in his Physics courses, and four out of six overall in his math courses. But, worth mentioning, these were far crueler, circa 1900, grading scales which did not measure to current standards. These were still good scores. But still. This was Einstein. His grade dips were marked by a lack of interest in the approaches of some professors and his own underestimation of the importance of Math. Einstein had all the brainpower and then some, to easily top students in any course when he chose to. But he was not your typical ambitious, must-get-perfect-grades type of student.

Look, he could be the greatest actor in this world. But he\u2019s still not fit to play Achilles however good he is. Because he clearly does not look ethnically Greek from Thessaly in any way shape or form. And yes, that matters. That matters in this very much.Achilles bandages the arm of Patroclus, his most loyal companion It\u2019s like if I\u2014an ethnic Persian\u2014was to play Martin Luther King or Malcolm X in a historical film\u2026 Okay, maybe not me. I may fill in some weird politically correct \u201cquota\u201d somehow, because of the fact that I\u2019m \u201cMiddle Eastern\u201d, and the world needs to \u201cpity\u201d me. Hmm. Well\u2026 Let\u2019s instead assume some northern European actor plays a specific African historical or a legendary character with detailed African homeland, culture, traditions and city of birth. How would that play out on social media, amongst celebrities and the general sensitive outraged public, I wonder? Where did this double standard come from? What are all these unnecessary quotas doing in arts, literature and cinema? This unprovoked race-baiting is honestly disgusting and has turned many people away from many TV-series, films and even books nowadays. We could have Hollywood making great films, historical, drama, sci-fi, comedies, etc., in African settings and with characters of African culture and descent. But why take already existing characters and turn them something they are not? Especially when it\u2019s only one-sided. And no, don\u2019t come at me with all that \u201cCleopatra was black, Hollywood is whitewashing African history\u201d. No, Cleopatra was actually also of Greek descent. People need to brush up on their history. The same goes for Jesus Christ in film, Jesus of Nazareth was an ethnic Jew from the Roman province Syria Palestina who spoke Aramaic, he was not of African descent nor was his mother. Africa as a continent is very diverse and magnificent in so many ways, with so many great cultures and countries, why not pick a great film idea from Africa instead of rewriting history. You have so much to choose from. Africa has plenty of untold stories that can be told and already-told stories that be dramatized on screen. There are plenty of good legends, myths and heroes in Africa, one can just pick one those and do it epically. So why steal and change what needs not be reshaped? Hollywood is doing no one a favor, not actors and not the viewers. All these \u201coutrages\u201d taking place\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s just comical at this point. I hope people wake up back to sanity again and we can all just be normal like we always been.",

This was not the case at all; upon hearing the news of striking the iceberg, Captain Smith was rendered catatonic at the realization that at least half the people onboard would die. He started whispering incoherent commands, one of which was misinterpreted as \u201cwomen and children only\u201d, which resulted in the loss of more lives than necessary. The Imitation Game: Alan TuringMost of the characters in The Imitation Game are poorly portrayed according to historical fact, but Alan Turing gets the worst of it. Depicted as being awkward and borderline autistic, Alan Turing in real life had quite a sense of humor and was generally charismatic. American Gangster: Frank LucasFrank Lucas, a Harlem crime lord, is portrayed as being brutal but also somewhat sympathetic and cerebral, when in reality, he had much less humanity than Denzel Washington gave the character. After all, he did transport drugs in the coffins of dead soldiers. Saving Mr. Banks: P.L. TraversThis movie genuinely confused me, as it seemed like self-congratulatory revisionism. The movie depicts P.L Travers as being meticulous about how her Mary Poppins movie is to be made, however at the end she is overcome with emotion by how good it was. The reality was quite the opposite. After seeing the movie, Travers never let Disney adapt one of her books again because she hated the animation and the way she was treated. To see Disney make a movie and portray their own founder and company as being benevolent while it was purely Travers who was belligerent during production is really strange; almost cult-like, if you ask me. The Blind Side: Michael OherThe real-life Michael Oher has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the movie as portraying him as a \u201cpassive\u201d and \u201cForrest Gump-like character\u201d in The Blind Side. Oher is depicted as being completely unaware of the game of football, when the real-life Michael was already playing, but he was disadvantaged as he grew up. The Greatest Showman: P.T. BarnumConsider The Greatest Showman to be nothing but fantasy. Every moment that Barnum is forward-thinking, sacrifices money for character, and seems romantically interested in a singer is false. The real P.T. Barnum was not a saint; he was a very successful businessman; he was set to make money first. American Made: Barry SealAs awesome as the movie is, Barry Seal was nothing like Tom Cruise. The real Barry Seal was heavily overweight and he began smuggling drugs before being contacted by the DEA. He wasn\u2019t contacted by the CIA to start running drugs while he was a commercial pilot; he was fired from his job at TWA for attempting to smuggle plastic explosives to Mexico. Straight Outta Compton: Arabian PrinceArabian Prince is nowhere to be seen in F. Gary Gray\u2019s Straight Outta Compton, to which the real Arabian Prince, Kim Richard Nazel, voiced his own displeasure. In interviews, he points out that he \u201cwas there\u201d for many of the events as shown in the film, and \u201cmost of the early stuff was recorded on my equipment\u201d. Rush: James Hunt and Niki LaudaFor dramatic purposes, the two characters of James Hunt and Niki Lauda were put as being bitter rivals, but the reality is much more tame. The two would share rooms together on the road, and the tension wasn\u2019t nearly as dramatic as depicted. The Social Network: Everyone\u201c\u2026the movie was clearly intended to be entertainment and not a fact-based documentary.\" -Eduardo Saverin \u201cwrong on many levels\u201d -Peter Thiel \u201c\u2026it is interesting to see my past rewritten in a way that emphasizes things that didn't matter, (like the Winklevosses, who I've still never even met and had no part in the work we did to create the site over the past 6 years) and leaves out things that really did\u2026\" -Dustin Moskovitz \"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\" -Mark Zuckerberg"

Just put a great homecoming parade and everyone would believe:So a hoax is possible, right? Well the problem is not if it is possible or not! It is how much would it cost to prepare and place such a gigantic hoax? There is this logical principle called Occam's razor - Wikipedia. It basically says that you should eliminate the less probable option - the one that takes too much complex operations to become true. So in our case , it would have been far more difficult to put such a gigantic hoax, and it would have been easier to just \u201cput a man on the moon\u201d. Just think about it: Think about the thousands of people that were working on the project. These were not actors - they were top engineers that have graduated top universities, so why would they risk their lifetime career by taking part in a hoax? So the government should have threaten them, but also should have given all of them 10 times more money (than usual salary + bonus) to keep their mouth shut. Also think about the USSR: USA should have made a secret pact with them to not tell the broad public about this hoax, and that would have been risky and again have a great cost, having in mind how crazy were the Soviet leaders at that time. Then comes the independent press, which again would have been very suspicious if the rocket launches were just shown on film / TV, so you should again have real rocket launches with press and ordinary people watching on place in Cape Canaveral. So again you should have had a rocket that goes high in the sky and becomes a dot after couple of minutes. Of course they could have just made a turn and crash it in the ocean, without anyone noticing, and never got it into space or to the moon, but the cost of such hoax becomes very high and definitely higher than the real thing! So don't believe these numerous evidences, like the re-transmitters that are still active on the Moon and anyone with some basic radio-waves knowledge and tools can transmit signals to and back the Moon - believe your logic! Hope this helps you make a decision! I have made it for myself and Occam\u2019s razor helped me there! Images are property of NASA.gov",

During their freewheeling conversation by the pool, Fallaci admitted that she had always been skeptical about Armstrong\u2019s famous first words: \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d[2]Photo: \u201cDuring the Apollo 12 mission, astronaut Alan Bean holds a container of lunar soil. The astronaut Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, who took the photograph, is reflected in Bean's faceshield.\u201d Hulton Archive, Getty Images. Astronaut Who Walked On The Moon: 'It Was Science Fiction To Us' Fallaci was firmly convinced that Armstrong\u2019s poetic declaration was not his choice. She believed NASA administrators had told Armstrong exactly what to say as soon as he set foot on the lunar surface.[3] Conrad knew the truth. He told Fallaci that the words might have been planned in advance, but NASA did not force Armstrong to say something specific.Conrad tried to convince her otherwise, but she was certain of it. Conrad persisted; he couldn\u2019t swear that Armstrong had written \u2018One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\u2019 but he was sure that whoever had penned it, Armstrong had chosen what he would say.[4]When Fallaci remained unmoved, the astronaut thought of a novel solution.\u2018Look,\u2019 he told his guest, \u2018I\u2019ll prove it to you. I\u2019ll make up my first words on the moon right here and now.\u2019 \u2018Impossible,\u2019 Fallaci pronounced in her thick accent. \u2018They\u2019ll never let you get away with it.\u2019 \u2018They won\u2019t have anything to say about it, Oriana. They won\u2019t know about it until I\u2019m on the moon.\u2019[5]In the past, Conrad had always joked that at 5 feet 6 inches in height, he was the shortest of NASA\u2019s recruits.[6] (Neil Armstrong was nearly 6 feet tall.)[7] He told Fallaci what he was going to say as soon as the mission landed.When Fallaci responded, \u2018You\u2019ll never do it,\u2019 Conrad answered, \u2018How about five hundred bucks?\u2019 They shook on it.[8]Two months later, on November 19, 1969, when the Apollo 12 successfully landed on the moon, Pete Conrad became only the third man in history to \u201cset foot in the lunar dust.\u201d[9] With five hundred dollars on the line, Conrad slowly climbed down the ladder and paused at the next to last rung. Sliding his hands along the rail, he jumped to the footpad on the ground.[10] His words were captured for posterity by the first color camera deployed on the surface.[11]Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but it\u2019s a long one for me.[12]He had won the bet, though he admitted later that he was never able to collect the five hundred dollars Fallaci owed him.[13]Photo: Pete Conrad climbing down to the moon\u2019s surface.

It was an amazing event which was awful for the bookmakers but truly fantastic for many punters. Frankie Dettori was a popular Italian jockey, well known for his likeable (despite being an Arsenal fan), cheeky character. Each year, there are several days of horse racing in England at a course called Ascot. There are some important races and all of the top trainers and jockeys attend. Frankie won the first race, then the second. His third ride managed to pip the well-fancied favourite to the post. The bookmakers were starting to get nervous. The horse racing experts would probably not have backed all of these four horses to win but Frankie\u2019s fame among the Saturday morning, small-time punters always guaranteed that the \u201cgrannies\u201d and armchair racing fans (of which there were many) liked to bet on his mounts. Bookmakers like to encourage these small-time gamblers to do what they call multiple-bets. These involve backing several horses with small stakes with several different combinations and accumulators. If horse A wins, the winnings are put onto horse B to win. Horse B wins and the accumulative winnings go onto horse C to win and so on. Bookies love these bets as the chances of the punters winning big are tiny. The chances of the bookies getting most of the stake back are much larger. When Frankie\u2019s fifth ride came in, the small-time Frankie backers already had nice winnings guaranteed. After his sixth horse won, they were looking at very good winnings indeed. At this point, bookies were going crazy with panic. They were already facing massive payouts. When you place a bet, you can ask for the odds at the time of placing the bet. Fujiyama Crest, Frankie\u2019s seventh mount in a seven race card was 11/1 in the morning with the firm I worked for. None of them expected the horse to win, but still, to be sure that they didn't lose too much, the odds were cut to 2/1. Punters, however, were more optimistic and started betting on Fujiyama Crest to win. The bookies secretly laughed at the mugs betting on this relative outsider at such short odds. And then, a few minutes later, the inevitable happened: Fujiyama hit the front of the field and scraped home by a neck to win. Frankie had done the impossible: he became the only jockey to have ever won all 7 races on a 7 race card. Our big bosses were probably weeping at their desks but for those of us who witnessed this in the shops it was an amazing experience. The \u201cmug\u201d punters had won huge amounts while seeing horse racing history being made.I must admit to being very happy to be giving the pensioners and \u201cclueless\u201d punters large cheques and big bundles of cash the following Monday. It made a change from paying the serious, miserable big time gamblers their winnings. The grannies coming in that day were incredulous and unbelievably happy. The bookies had suffered terribly but it was nice to watch them suffer for once, even though I was working for them. My company lost around \u00a38 million due to Frankie\u2019s feat, the British bookmaking industry as a whole about\u00a330 million. And just what were the odds? The cumulative odds at the end of the race based on the odds the horses finished at were over 25,000/1. However, remember how I wrote that it's possible to take the odds at the time of placing the bet? Anyone who had done this (and there were many who did) won around \u00a3236,000 for a \u00a31 accumulator. What a day! 27 Frankie Dettori's Magnificent Seven",

If any have passed prior to December 2019 they'er still here because evidently their passing was not reported until well after December 2019. Priscilla Montgomery, Munchkin (child) - played a munchkin villager.... can be seen on the yellow brick road. She was born on July 19, 1929 in Los Angeles, California, USA. Joan Kenmore or Joan Barbara Kenmore. Munchkin (child) - played a munchkin villager.... She can be seen in the background outside of one of the little huts with the other munchkins around her She was wearing a decorative flowerpot hat. She was born on November 3, 1931 in Los Angeles, California, USA Ardith Dondanville... Munchkin (child) - played a munchkin villager, who can be seen in the background with the other munchkin villagers. She was born in 1930 in California, USA. Betty Ann Bruno... Munchkin (child) - played a munchkin villager.... can be seen waving from one of the huts. She was born on May 4, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Valerie Lee.... Munchkin (child) - played a munchkin villager..... can be seen in the crowd with the other munchkins outside the huts. She was born on December 14, 1931 in Los Angeles, California, USA as Lois Valerie Shepard. (She is the only person on this list that's unconfirmed.)",
            "The original Wizard of Oz movie was made in 1925, so I doubt anyone involved with it is still alive (fun fact: Oliver Hardy played the Tin Man in the original movie). Same goes for the second, more popular movie, made in 1939.",
            "I believe the last cast member passed on last year. I remember Judy Garland passing about 1970 and Ed Sullivan devoting an episode of his show to a tribute to her. I saw Ray Bolger, the Scarecrow, in a couple of episodes of The Partridge Family and Bert Lahr was in The Night They Raided Minsky\u2019s, both in the early seventies. Margaret Hamilton did commercials for Maxwell House coffee in the late sixties. Aside from the original film, those are my memories of this cast.",

All that remains is to confront the Wizard. And when she does, it\u2019s the needs of her friends she focuses on first. She has changed. Another theme: the man behind the curtain.

Before Dorothy arrives, there are essentially four competing power bases in Oz - the Wizard, the \u201cgood\u201d witch Glinda, and the \u201cwicked\u201d witches of the east and west. Each has their own community that they rule over - Glinda with her munchkins, the wizard in the Emerald City, the wicked witch with her flying monkeys (we never see the realm of the other witch). There\u2019s a certain balance of power going on. And then Dorothy arrives, killing one of these four rulers and upsetting the balance of power. We now have three rulers, all with very different styles, and all vying to fill the vacuum.Glinda is all sweetness and light, encouraging her minions to be happy but treating them as children.The Wicked Witch rules through fear and cruelty; her minions do her bidding or else.The Wizard rules from isolation with a mix of intimidation and benefaction. He rewards and punishes in equal measure, but doesn\u2019t mix with the people because - unlike the others - he is a fraud.Glinda immediately seizes upon the opportunity, pressing Dorothy into her service and setting the Wicked Witch against her by stealing a dead woman\u2019s shoes. The Witch can do nothing at this point but rant and rave, but her attention is now diverted - rather than consolidating her power base by taking over her sister\u2019s domain, she\u2019s caught up with pursuing Dorothy. Put out of your head any thought that Glinda was doing this to help Dorothy. She was using her from the start. Dorothy\u2019s one wish is to get home, and Glinda already knows how to do this - she tells Dorothy at the very end how to use those ruby slippers. She knew all along. So why send her off on a dangerous quest to see the Wizard? Because she needs a patsy, and Dorothy is perfect. Dorothy then recruits three friends - none of them really all that much use, but they provide moral support and are a further distraction - and the Witch attempts to stop them along the way. Glinda steps in only when she absolutely has to. Dorothy finally reaches the Emerald City, where she \u201cmeets\u201d with the Wizard, who also senses an opportunity here. But while Glinda just sets her off with a smile, the Wizard is more direct - he wants to seize power himself, and he too uses Dorothy as a means to do so, this time by striking a bargain with her. Kill the Witch, and he\u2019ll give her what she wants. (I don\u2019t think the Wizard expects her to be able to do it, and it was by dumb luck in the end, but he loses nothing in the attempt.) When Dorothy does as she\u2019s asked, the Wizard is surprised. He\u2019s even more surprised when Dorothy reveals him as a fraud. He humbly rewards her friends for their minimal help, then sets out to do what she asks. Now he\u2019s been exposed as a fraud, his power base is destabilised and he prepares to flee - but he generously offers to take her with him. In the end, she gets left behind. There\u2019s only one ruler left in Oz now - Glinda. Through a mix of lies, coercion and psychology, she\u2019s managed to kill at least one Wicked Witch (did she have a hand in that falling farmhouse? Nobody knows\u2026) and depose the Wizard. All that remains is to get rid of her assassin, the now famous Dorothy, and so she really does send her home - after all, killing her would be a big mistake. The moral is - be seen to be kind to everyone, and use other people to do your dirty work. Dictators never last long if they try to rule through fear and trickery."

Just put a great homecoming parade and everyone would believe:So a hoax is possible, right? Well the problem is not if it is possible or not! It is how much would it cost to prepare and place such a gigantic hoax? There is this logical principle called Occam's razor - Wikipedia. It basically says that you should eliminate the less probable option - the one that takes too much complex operations to become true. So in our case , it would have been far more difficult to put such a gigantic hoax, and it would have been easier to just \u201cput a man on the moon\u201d. Just think about it: Think about the thousands of people that were working on the project. These were not actors - they were top engineers that have graduated top universities, so why would they risk their lifetime career by taking part in a hoax? So the government should have threaten them, but also should have given all of them 10 times more money (than usual salary + bonus) to keep their mouth shut. Also think about the USSR: USA should have made a secret pact with them to not tell the broad public about this hoax, and that would have been risky and again have a great cost, having in mind how crazy were the Soviet leaders at that time. Then comes the independent press, which again would have been very suspicious if the rocket launches were just shown on film / TV, so you should again have real rocket launches with press and ordinary people watching on place in Cape Canaveral. So again you should have had a rocket that goes high in the sky and becomes a dot after couple of minutes. Of course they could have just made a turn and crash it in the ocean, without anyone noticing, and never got it into space or to the moon, but the cost of such hoax becomes very high and definitely higher than the real thing! So don't believe these numerous evidences, like the re-transmitters that are still active on the Moon and anyone with some basic radio-waves knowledge and tools can transmit signals to and back the Moon - believe your logic! Hope this helps you make a decision! I have made it for myself and Occam\u2019s razor helped me there! Images are property of NASA.gov",

But if you are doubtful about Apollo 11 you will surely be even more skeptical about Apollo 17. You can watch the video of his expedition and share his excitement as a geologist as he made new discoveries on the Moon every hour.Remember - every time he picks up a rock sample there - as a researcher you can go and ask to see that very sample and analyse it and test it to check or confirm theories about the lunar surface. And that the rocks you can go and see - they look exactly as expected from the videos -same shape, same composition, if they pick up orange soil, they return orange soil, if they pick up a strangely shaped rock, they return a rock of exactly that shape... Especially when you also read about Harrison Schmidt's field trip, here A Field Trip to the Moon - and more detailed accounts elsewhere, the discoveries they made. How could they fake rocks to give the right results in experiments that would be done decades later using instruments not yet invented at the time, and to give reasonable results when used to test scientific theories about the Moon that nobody had thought of back then? And all the time also be appropriate rocks for the locations they were found in the videos taken way back then of the astronauts actually picking them up? EXAMPLE OF AN INTERESTING LUNAR ROCK STUDIED WITH TWENTY FIRST CENTURY INSTRUMENTS For instance this oneTroctolite 76535 Studied for instance in this 2009 paper examining isotope ratios and giving new results about the moon Early Lunar Magnetism Do you think they anticipated that some time in 2009 someone would examine this rock and want to find out the isotope ratios of Argon and manipulated them to make them appropriate for a hyopthesis not even thought of at the time? And designed the film to make everything fit together seamlessly to fit those ideas? MICROMETEORITE DAMAGE And then - to somehow simulated micro-meteorite damage and spherules in all the lunar samples so that even when looked at with electron microscopes they still look like lunar rocks?Spherule with micrometeorite damage in lunar rocks. We don't get micrometeorites on Earth, because they burn up in the atmosphere, while the lunar rocks are damaged in this way. This is an immediate give away that the rocks come from somewhere in space, where they have been exposed to micrometeorites for billions of years. Even today we wouldn't have the technology to simulate this damage on all the samples, so they would stand up to electron microscope scrutiny.The rocks are similar to Earth rocks, true - that was a surprise, how similar they are, and lead to the theory that the Moon was formed by an impact with the Earth. But not identical. One obvious difference is that they all had micro-meteorite impacts which Earth rocks don't have. At a level you can explore with the electron microscope - no way that could be simulated in 1960s. I don't think we could do it convincingly today - might spend millions of dollars trying to simulate a gram of lunar rock so that a randomly selected sample would look right in an electron microscope, and fail. COMPOSITION OF THE ROCKS Also they were very very dry, lacking in volatiles and not hydrated like their Earth counterparts. And many are as old as 4.5 billion years old, older than any Earth rocks. See Moon rock And the rocks match the rocks that the astronauts can be seen picking up on the Moon in the videos, same shape, exactly the right material etc. to match the place they pick it up in the lunar surface. Or if you think unmanned rovers on the Moon brought the rocks back - how do they exactly match the rocks the astronauts pick up in the videos? Also, not just returned by US astronauts. The Russian Luna program returned a total of 0.326 kg in all their missions to the Moon, which confirms what's been found in the Apollo rocks. The rocks don't match any other rocks from Earth, or outer space. We now have Lunar meteorites which we can recognize because they match the composition of the lunar rocks. Here is a comment by an expert on lunar meteorites:\"Any geoscientist (and there have been thousands from all over the world) who has studied lunar samples knows that anyone who thinks the Apollo lunar samples were created on Earth as part of government conspiracy doesn't know much about rocks. The Apollo samples are just too good. They tell a self-consistent story with a complexly interwoven plot that's better than any story any conspirator could have conceived. I've studied lunar rocks and soils for 40+ years and I couldn't make even a poor imitation of a lunar breccia, lunar soil, or a mare basalt in the lab. And with all due respect to my clever colleagues in government labs, no one in \"the Government\" could do it either, even now that we know what lunar rocks are like. Lunar samples show evidence of formation in an extremely dry environment with essentially no free oxygen and little gravity. Some have impact craters on the surface and many display evidence for a suite of unanticipated and complicated effects associated with large and small meteorite impacts. Lunar rocks and soil contain gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon) derived from the solar wind with isotope ratios different than Earth forms of the same gases. They contain crystal damage from cosmic rays. Lunar igneous rocks have crystallization ages, determined by techniques involving radioisotopes, that are older than any known Earth rocks. (Anyone who figures out how to fake that is worthy of a Nobel Prize.) It was easier and cheaper to go to the Moon and bring back some rocks then it would have been to create all these fascinating features on Earth.\" See How Do We Know That It's a Rock from the Moon?TRACKING BY INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS The Apollo 11 mission, as for the other missions, was tracked by professional astronomers and keen amateurs (reported in Sky at Night magazine) on its way to the Moon. See Telescopic Tracking of the Apollo Lunar Missions Also the Jodrell bank telescope tracked it along with all the other space missions on its way to the Moon, with such precision, that using doppler shift of the signal they could see in their recordings where Neil Armstrong took over with manual control during descent to the lunar surface. Referred to here: Jodrell Bank stories - I'll try to find a better link to it. They also simultaneously tracked the Luna 15 attempt by Russia to return a sample from the Moon which crashed somewhere in the sea of tranquility. You can listen to the recording of them as they tracked Lunar 15, with the sound of the Apollo astronauts in the background in the broadcasts they picked up from the Moon here: Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics For more about this, see Third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings (Wikipedia) SIMULATING WALKING ON THE MOON And do you think they really managed to simulate Apollo astronauts walking on the Moon to look real, to this day? When the most sophisticated movie about the Moon done before the landing was 2001, the year before - where this is their best footage they managed, after five years of work on the film, for the lunar sequence:I can tell you the film was pretty amazing to watch at the time. We didn't know any better. It came out in 1968, the year before Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. But look at it today - and is obvious those astronauts are just walking slowly, doesn't even resemble the lunar walking on the Moon. Even today, our movies of astronauts on the Moon surface are not convincing for those who watched the Apollo landings. For instance on the \"Apollo 18\" movie - looks nothing like the real thing, just walking slowly basically. I think myself, the only way to do it reasonably convincingly, even today - apart from microgravity flights and film everything in planes 20 seconds at a time - is something like thisFrom the NASA Archive: The Lunar Walking Problem | Science | WIRED Which NASA did have in the 1960s - but - I've never seen anyone suggest they used this - and - how could you anyway - attach wires to absolutely everything that moves (including flag etc). In a Mythbusters episode they looked at the idea that the moon walking could be done by slow motion video, and showed that it didn't look exactly like the lunar footage + other tests of moon conspiracy ideas. Episode 104: NASA Moon Landing Here is another take on the whole thing by a movie director:Writer/director S G Collins of Postwar Media debunks every theory that the Apollo Moon landings could have been faked in a studio. The filmmaker takes a look at the video technology of the late 1960's, showing alleged fraud was simply not possible.And you can now see photographs of the tracks they made on the Moon, taken from orbit.It's not only harder to fake than to do it. It's literally impossible to fake, not without ability to look into the future and have technology not yet invented and know about future scientific theories and instruments not yet invented. MITCHELL AND WEBB SKETCHSee also The Great Moon Hoax - and the other answers on this page are great :). PROFESSIONAL CALM OF THE ASTRONAUTS Actually I wonder if part of it was because most of the astronauts were so professional about it and calm. They don't really seem like people doing things for the first time ever perhaps. Maybe it looks as if they can't be in any danger because they are so very calm? But remember these are people who are professionally trained to be calm in the middle of a crisis in a jet fighter which is about to crash. It takes years of training to be as steady and calm as that - you and I could never do it without that training (unless you are in a similar profession). We've seen so many movies of things like this and the actors in the movies are so much more excited by things and scared by them (even though it is acted) than the lunar astronauts seemed to be, and convey that excitement and fear to the audience well. Perhaps, paradoxically, if we'd sent actors to the Moon they would have been more convincing to the skeptics :). On that first landing on the Moon especially - though they had done everything they could to make it safe - there was certainly a real risk that they would crash (even through momentary pilot error) and a significant risk that once landed, they would not be able to leave the Moon again but would die there or crash on take off. And they all knew that. The US had even prepared a speech for the president to say in the event that the Apollo 11 astronauts landed, and could not take off from the Moon again. Here it is What if the moon landings had failed? The poignant and moving speech that President Nixon would have delivered if Apollo 11 astronauts had not come home But you'd never guess that they knew that from the way they talked. Here is Neil Armstrong narrating the video of their landing, done in parallel with Google MoonSee also Robert Walker's answer to Did NASA fake their first moon landing?",

The main reason is that nobody thought it was worth spending the money once it had been done enough times to show it wasn't just a one-off fluke. Once the Soviet Union had clearly withdrawn from the race to put a human being on the Moon, the sense of urgency evaporated.  One big problem was that the Apollo program was a project without a defined future. The program's goal was achieving a successful Moon landing as quickly as possible. To do this required a staggering level of effort that simply could not be maintained for long. Every major piece of equipment, from the first stage engines to the lunar suits was, effectively, experimental. That made them expensive and often difficult to build. It also meant that there was a greater level of risk than what you'd expect from mature technologies. As an example, the Apollo Guidance Computer was a marvelously advanced piece of electronics in 1967. By 1972, the design had been modified in a rather hap-hazard way to meet the rapidly changing requirements. It had become a dated system, all but incapable of further development. Yet, replacing it would have caused cascades of redesigns throughout the Command-Service Module stack and the Lunar Module. There's an expression used to describe people who've achieved their cherished dreams: \"What do you do after you've gone to the Moon?\" This was very much NASA's curse (and, perhaps the USA's curse) after Apollo.",

You may be surprised to hear that from a 20 year NASA veteran, but talking about a trip to Mars is, unfortunately, just rhetoric by the same old unfocused NASA who has lost their way looking for a quick, easy way back into the news. The real reason why we didn't get back to the Moon has nothing to do with technology. It's politics, plain and simple. And the biggest issue is that NASA leadership has always been made up of great engineers, but lousy forward thinkers and they have never really understood the way to reach the public through the media.  Now NASA leadership knows that good engineers don't necessarily make good educators or public relations people, so they hire an army of ex-journalists to run their various outreach programs. But guess what - someone who has studied journalism usually knows nothing about science, technology and innovation, so they don't really understand how to present it either.  It makes me nuts! How hard is it to excite people over space exploration? It should be easy, but if you are a \"head-in-the-sand\" specialist in anything, you won't get it. NASA outreach departments and future planning divisions should be run by sci-fi fans! They get it!  For my last 5 years at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I managed an educational outreach program for the early Pluto mission, a Europa orbiter, and a solar probe. I learned first hand how NASA's educational leadership has a hard time figuring out how to engage the public. I - and a lot of folks like me - think we should have focused on the Moon and we can't believe that NASA let all that technology lay in ruins. That's right, we no longer have the capability to go back to the Moon! It would cost untold billions of dollars to reproduce what we already had: the capability to take a 3-day trip and send people to our nearest celestial body. If we had continued a lunar program, we probably could have had a small city on the Moon by now and we would be well on the way to developing the technologies that could enable us to explore other planets one day. The reality is - and I was working at JPL at the time when this happened - once the Soviet Union fell and the implied cold war between us and them ended, members of the U.S. Congress actually called NASA and said \"well, you guys are done now, right? We no longer need a U.S. space program since there is no longer any need to race with the Russians.\" I am not kidding. They really did. NASA stayed in existence by a thin thread, but it became crystal clear that U.S. lawmakers had no idea why we explored space other than to race the Russians. Since then, NASA has been unfocused and in a vain attempt to impress politicians with something flashy, cam...",

            "There never was much value in going to the Moon in the first place, so there was no good reason to return. When J.F.

When Kennedy died, I think we were determined to get to the Moon in the now sacred deadline of the late 1960s, to fulfill Kennedy\u2019s dream. Scientists liked the Moon shot, primarily (this is my observation, not based on a careful poll) because it injected a lot of money into science in space. If the same money had been made available for science in space, but not involving human transport, then most scientists would have favored unmanned experiments, including unmanned exploration of the Moon. It made much more financial sense, but most people (especially at NASA) believed that without the human involvement, the public would not support high levels of spending. Once we met Kennedy\u2019s goals, of restoring the US spirit and self confidence, then the financial considerations took over. There simply is not much value added by putting men on the Moon; arguably, there is much science value lost. (Science experiments that have to be man-safe are far more expensive.) On the other hand, you\u2019ll notice that not a lot of money has been spent on sending robots to the Moon. Some, and they\u2019ve done some remarkable things, but not the many billions that go along with a man shot. Instead, we have spent our resources with unmanned exploration of the solar system, with truly spectacular results. We\u2019ve discovered that every moon of every planet appears to be different from every other moon! (That\u2019s only a slight exaggeration.) The great glory of NASA in the last few decades has been its unmanned program. In comparison, the Space Station has accomplished very little. (Again, that is my personal evaluation.)",

Some of them didn't. People died in the effort. Enormous amounts of money were spent in research and development. The nation was highly focused on putting people on the Moon, exploring it, and getting them back safely. There was definitely no CGI involved. In fact, CGI would not be invented for a long time. The very idea that these missions were filmed on a movie set is utterly absurd on the face of it. The thousands of people involved in each mission, from engineers to mathematicians, technicians, communications people, managers, the astronauts themselves, their trainers, the testers, the inspectors, the mechanics, the makers of the rockets, capsules, landing modules, space suits, life support systems, launching pads, the systems for telemetry, control, navigation, communications, recovery, and escape, the means of assembling and transporting the rockets, of analyzing all of the data gathered for each mission, etc? Could all these people and all this work have been just pretend, as part of a vast conspiracy? The famous expression \u201cTwo men can keep a secret if one of them is dead\u201d comes to mind. The public watched the space program grow step by step, with failures, successes, and a few disasters along the way. Remember that these missions took place over a decade or more, and that they proceeded cautiously, with each mission having a specific goal. Can a human survive a short spaceflight? Can we build a craft that we can put in orbit and then control the de-orbiting? How do we handle the tremendous heat of re-entry? How about with a larger craft, with two astronauts, for a longer time? Can we actually get to the moon? What is the surface like? Can we walk on it? How can we structure a spacecraft to enable travel to the Moon, orbit the Moon, send a vehicle down to the surface, live there for a few days, explore, then take off and rejoin the orbiting module, then leave Moon orbit and travel all the way back to Earth orbit, and finally de-orbit and splash down safely? Every one of these steps is a major engineering challenge, and we watched every one of them get solved through multiple iterations of improved designs. People who doubt the reality of the US space program are acting like NASA just announced one day, \u201cGuess what? We put people on the moon! And here are some carefully cropped pictures to prove we were there. Oh, and some rocks we found.\u201d If it had actually happened that way, one could legitimately question the reality of the Moon landings. But that's not what happened. The nation watched the whole effort gradually progress through all of the stages I've enumerated above, one by one, launch by launch, program by program, and it was absolutely real. If you don't believe the space program was real, then please explain to me when the fakery started. If the Apollo program was fake, how about the Gemini program? Or Mercury? Were they real? Remember there was no CGI back then. There was barely anything you would even call a computer, let alone special effects. So if the early missions, say Mercury, were real, with all those highly trained people doing all that cutting edge work, but then for whatever reason, NASA decided to start faking everything, you're telling me that all of those people switched overnight from doing real work in their highly specialized fields to pretending to work, faking space missions, and nobody squealed? Ever? Again, \u201cTwo men can keep a secret if one of them is dead.\u201d",

Alternatively, one Afghan told me that the reason there was crime and violence in the West is because women there showed their skin and hair... but I suppose this is less a conspiracy than general ignorance... forgive me, the line is blurry. The best, though, was a widespread belief that the US and the Taliban were in league with each other, only pretending to fight for appearances. The US funds the Taliban, while the Taliban gives the Americans an excuse to occupy their country and exploit their vast reserves of... dirt? I don't know... the last part was never made clear to me. (Step 1: Ally with Taliban. Step 2: ??? Step 3: Profit!) This stems largely from the severe, literally incomprehensible overmatch of technology. Arthur C. Clarke said, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" Similarly, it may be impossible to understand that even magic has limits. The Afghans feel that with all our American technology, equipment, drones, radar, satellites, etc, we should be able to find and kill the Taliban with a hand wave and a wink of the eye; that we don't is evidence of conspiracy. To relay an experience, a Soldier was missing, so we inquired of a local judge as to what he might know. He scoffed before denying knowledge. When pressed as to why he scoffed, he said, \"You say what you have to say, and ask what you must ask for your information operations campaign, but we know that your Soldier is not missing.\" \"Of course he is!\" we said. \"What would make you say that?\" \"My sister,\" he replied, \"lives in California.

Kennedy was NOT assassinated on 22 November 1963 in Dallas, Texas; it was an elaborate staged hoax involving Walt Disney animatronic technology following a plan created by Lewis Carroll (author of Alice in Wonderland) and executed by Walt Disney (yes, that Walt Disney). Take a breath, apply some salve to your reddened forehead and get ready, because it does not end there: The plot also involved Aldous Huxley (author of Brave New World) and C.S. Lewis (Chronicles of Narnia). Whether they also faked their deaths or if they were secretly assassinated is unclear to the conspiracy theorist, but as far as she is concerned, it is TRUE. Now, I do not want to be accused of promoting this insanity; I am just reporting it to answer the question. This is the pet theory of the (now banned) Quora User Elisa Gregory . Any brain-hurt, blame her; she seems convinced that Disney, Lewis, Huxley, and Kennedy are all part of some massive conspiracy planned out by Carroll. Just read through some of the questions she has asked: Why do people believe JFK was shot? How come people can\u2019t figure out that Disney was in on Kennedy\u2019s assassination? Why can't people recognize the Kennedy, Disney hoax with the lucky Lee Harvey Oswald rabbit? Why don't they say that Lee Harvey Oswald Rabbit killed the President of Hearts in a heart-shaped plaza? Do people not recognize the truth in a society of lies? Why is the JFK assassination a shooting hoax? Which Disney girl played marina in aldous huxleys adaptation of of alice in wonderland? Is walt Disney surrounded by the deaths of l.Oswald, aldous Huxley, CS Lewis and the president of hearts? In the JFK assassination, I found no physical evidence of a knoll shooter but lots of evidence of a car backfiring? If LIFE magazine could fool millions of people with a mannequin named Cynthia, could they hoax a JFK assassination? Did Adolf Hitler work for Disney? Is the JFK assassination an illusion of a shooting, with a confusion of rifles and evidence and a lack of shooters being seen? How come, when Disney's Aldous Huxley and Disney\u2019s C. S. Lewis died on November 22, 1963, 'marina in heartland' is released as JFK\u2019s assassination? Why do people perceive the JFK assassination as real when it\u2019s an adaptation of Alice in Wonderland? What if JFK was a Kennedy, RKO Pictures and Disney Studios collaboration? What if JFK was a media hoax? It goes on and on. You know what is even worse? Often she would ask the question and then post the only answer; a rambling, nonsensical, badly punctuated, somewhat paranoid rant... that although impossibly disjointed points out enough coincidences to show that it is not a 100% bonkers idea... ...just about 99.9999999999999999% bonkers.

Everybody ready for bed? Once upon a time there was a place in Nevada where nobody lived. The Air Force had a small base there. A bunch of scientists built a very powerful weapon that ended the World War number two. It was very complicated and the scientists had no real understanding of how powerful it really was so they built some more and wanted to blow them up where there were no people it could effect. Somebody knew about this vacant place in Nevada, so they moved there and blew up their bombs until the whole world decided that was too dangerous and made them blow them up underground and they dug holes in Nevada and blew up more bombs until they could build bombs that worked that didn\u2019t need to be tested. Then they went home. There was another group of people who made airplanes and tested other things for the armed forces and they didn\u2019t want other people, especially the bad ones, to know about them. So they went to the empty space in Nevada. They couldn\u2019t use the testing place for the bombs, but they found a lake that had dried up. There they could test the airplanes and make them as good as possible to go look and take pictures of what the bad guys were doing. It was called \u201cGroom Lake\u201d. The little air base was called Nellis, after pilot who was hero and died in the World War 2, got jet planes and so they needed a big piece of airspace to teach the pilots how to fly. The government made that area off limits, so nobody who wasn\u2019t doing something with the airplanes could go there. The land was so big that the airbase got out a map and divided up the land and called each division an area and gave them numbers. the big flat space called Groom Lake was in Area 51. They moved in and the other airbase knew about them but nobody else did except the President and his closest friends. They built an airport and some places for people to live while they worked. Nobody was allowed to bring their families and their families couldn\u2019t tell anybody where they were( sort of like hide and seek.) some of the people who worked there didn\u2019t even know where they were. So they built the airplanes in California and at nighttime they flew them to Nevada and landed them at Groom Lake. They flew the airplanes and kept making them better until they were the best and then the airplanes went to places all around the world where they hid when they were not flying and taking pictures and listening to the bad guys. Some flew very high and the other ones flew very fast so the bad guys couldn\u2019t catch them (sort of like a flying game of tag). After a while, they took the pictures from up in space and the airplanes went to museums to retire. There were other people who were building things that they didn\u2019t want the bad guys to know about. They heard about Groom Lake and went there. Somebody slipped and the name of \u201cGroom Lake\u201d came out and so they changed the name to \u201cWatertown Strip\u201d. After a while they just called it \u201cArea 51\u201d. You know that thing that happens when somebody has a secret and everybody else wants to know, but the person with the secret won\u2019t tell? Sometimes they make up stories about the secret so they look cool and other people like stories and they tell other people until some people don\u2019t think they\u2019re stories and believe they\u2019re real. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened at Area 51, so if you tell stories other people want to hear, like about flying saucers or people from outer space are living in Area 51, some people think they\u2019re true and try to make people think that the place nobody can\u2019t go is where they are. OK. everybody go to sleep. When I know a secret that telling it won\u2019t get anybody hurt or help the bad guys, after a while I\u2019ll tell it to you. Good night.",

The cause of the accident was found to be several small design flaws and some quality control problems.  The worst of these were fixed within a year, but a full fix would require another 18-24 months.  It was deemed worthwhile to run the LHC at half energy in order to get preliminary science and postpone the second round of fixes to after this first round of data taking. The first round of data taking, in 2010, 2011, and 2012 was a resounding success, but now CERN has to perform the major fixes in order to bring the LHC up to full energy.   This will take most of 2013 and 2014 resulting in the first collisions at full energy most likely in early 2015.   The reason why CERN management chose to perform the fixes now is because in 2012 the LHC had reached nearly its full data taking potential and produced 5 times as much data as it did in 2011.  If they were to run in 2013, they would simply double the amount of data that they had. Doubling the data is nice, but delaying the full energy run of the LHC for another year tips the cost benefit analysis to doing the fix.

Proper safety procedures were in force, the safety systems performed as expected, and no-one was put at risk. But the fault did delay work on the LHC by six months. After the incident, CERN engineers decided that such interconnections should be upgraded to avoid similar electrical faults in future. As a precaution, beams in the LHC were accelerated below the LHC's design limit for the first three years of running. Upgrading the interconnections will be one of the main activities at the LHC during its two-year shutdown, allowing the LHC to run at 7 TeV per beam when it starts up again. There are 10,000 \"splices\" \u2013 superconducting connections between magnets \u2013 on the LHC. Each splice carries 13,000 amps. Over the next 18 months, technicians will add an additional piece \u2013 a \"shunt\" \u2013 to each splice. The shunt is a low-resistance connection that forms an alternative path for a portion of the current in the event that the splice loses its superconducting state. A total of 27,000 shunts will be installed in the 27-kilometre accelerator.  Source (with video) - Cern Explains Why the LHC Has To Go Bye-Bye For the Next Two Years",

Longer answer: As with all legal questions, the answer is \u201cit depends.\u201d And what it depends on is whether you are being accused of a crime or simply being questioned as a witness in a crime. Being accused as a participant in a crime. In this scenario, you have been detained by the police, and they want to question you. You assert your right to remain silent until you have had the chance to talk to your lawyer. You will eventually get a lawyer and your lawyer will either advise you to answer the question, or to assert your rights under the 5th Amendment and not answer because your answer may incriminate you. However, what you must understand here was quoted by Cicero\u2019s maxim: \u201cThough silence is not necessarily an admission, it is not a denial, either.\u201d Remember, only the government is enjoined from using your testimony against you (or in this case, your lack of testimony). Your employer can cite the whole sordid affair and simply choose to fire you because they don\u2019t want to be involved in your potential lawlessness. Most employment in the United States is \u201cat will\u201d employment, and an employer can fire you for pretty much whatever reason they choose, unless it violates a civil right (in other words, you can\u2019t be fired because of your sex, race, national origin, disability status, or religion) Being questioned as a witness in a crime. In this scenario, you haven\u2019t been detained; you\u2019ve simply been asked to come down to the police station and give a statement regarding something else. If you\u2019re not being detained, you\u2019re not under any obligation to cooperate with the police, and they can\u2019t compel you to give a statement or \u201ccooperate\u201d at all. While it might be difficult for your employer to find out whether or not you were questioned, it\u2019s not impossible, especially if the incident about which your cooperation was requested involved your employer. For example, let\u2019s say that computers were being stolen from your employer, and your friend and co-worker was being accused of the crime. The police want to question you about it, not because they believe you did it, but because they know you are a friend of the accused. You certainly can choose to not cooperate with them, and that information could make it back to your employer. And yes, they can fire you simply because they don\u2019t like the fact that you could be protecting a thief. Again, in most cases, your employer can fire you for nearly any reason they choose, so long as it is not an unlawful reason. Protecting the integrity of their business is certainly a viable reason to terminate someone\u2019s employment. It\u2019s also important to understand that the 5th Amendment only protects you in a criminal case. If it\u2019s a civil case, in many cases they may be allowed to draw an \u201cadverse inference\u201d from your refusal to testify, which means that they are allowed to make the connection that because you refused to testify, you may be protecting information that implicates you. Remember too that the \u201ccourt of public opinion\u201d generally views pleading the 5th as a tacit admission of guilt, regardless of what the court can or cannot do. If how you are perceived in society is important to you, then it may not be advantageous to plead the 5th.",
            "In the United States, unless you have a contract or state law limiting the reasons an employer can fire an employee and the true reason for the firing is not illegal discrimination, yes. Employers are free to fire employees for any or no reason at all. Refusing to cooperate with a police investigation is not a protected activity for employment purposes, so an employer can legally fire an employee for that reason.",

So General Ramey had the original handler of the crash, Major Jesse Marcel below pose with a torn weather balloon to sell the lie to the press. And it worked.Bodies were reportedly discovered along the crash. So the military came up with another cover story that did not correspond with the weather balloon or any type of balloons including project Mogul. Lie #2 : So the military\u2019s explanation for the small alien bodies discovered at the Roswell crash were crash test dummies. But the problem is that crash test dummies weren't tested until between 1952 and 1960. And this of course doesn\u2019t align with the Roswell crash of 1947.Lie #3: Project Mogul was supposedly a top secret high altitude spy balloon project. But it is still a balloon and when condensed, a small object that would have never drawn the elaborate military operation that occurred at the Roswell discovery site.So now, Major Jesse Marcel who handled the crash collection, insisted during his aged years that the items that he collected in Roswell was no balloon of any kind and could not have been made on earth due to their incredible qualities. Surely, an intelligence officer of that stature would know the difference between balloon materials of any kind,and a large flying \u201csaucer\u201d or disc with debris that due to weight, velocity and impact, scattered more than 500 feet requiring a large military recovery operation.Please note: Photo of saucer shaped craft above is not authentic. it was meant to provide a visual, illustrating the obvious difference between a flying disc and balloons. There simply is no comparison between the two scenario as the other actual photos above of weather balloons illustrate. So, how does a flying \u201csaucer\u201d get confused with a weather balloon by so many well informed military officials who had ample time to tell the difference before the news was released to the press ? A flying \u201csaucer\u201d means that what was taken away, despite the broken debris must have been largely intact enough to be discerned as a flying disc meaning that the bulk of the recovery was a partially intact disc that the military took away. How does one dismiss the original official lies, and still accept the final explanation of another balloon without question ? The Smithsonian Institute and all major Government and Press organ...",

He was one of the first men on the scene of the Roswell crash:However, this was the original headline which came out the day before (8th July, 1947):Now, listen to Jesse Marcel\u2019s story years later, in which he claims that the wreckage he is holding in the photo was definitely NOT what he originally found:Here\u2019s a few more people who were around at the same time:   oh, and when you\u2019ve listened to that, you may want to listen to this guy, Lieutenant Colonel Phillip J Corso:You can check out his credentials here: Philip J. Corso - Wikipedia He is the author of \u2018The Day After Roswell\u2019 in which he claims that the US military recovered not only three alien bodies, but also helped to reverse engineer various technologies retrieved from the wreckage, which led us to develop the laser, the microwave, the Strategic Defense Initiative and more bizarrely the transistor, which incidentally seemingly came out of nowhere in 1947. Bear in mind, this was the same year as the Roswell crash and was supposedly invented by the American Computer Company, which eventually became Bell Laboratories. This is a very strange story which seems to corroborate Corso\u2019s claims.

Remember, keep these explanations in context with the eyewitness reports above: Your Burning Questions About The Roswell Incident, Answered Over and over again it appears that the witnesses were frightened into silence by the military who threatened the lives of their families and loved ones. This is why so many first hand witnesses were reluctant to come forward, but slowly over time, things start to leak out. People make deathbed confessions or get so old that they no longer care about the government threats. That is what appears to be the case here.

Be warned, there is also a lot of bullshit out there, but once you cut through all of that, you realise that there is something more to this story than meets the eye. It certainly was NOT a crashed weather balloon. UPDATE: Check out Tom Delonge on Youtube. There appears to be some VERY interesting developments going on here. I\u2019m not sure at this stage whether this is genuine disclosure or some kind of publicity stunt, but all of the government officials and experts appear to be legitimate:",
            "From everything that I have seen and learned, including a few days of going through the library at the UFO Museum in Roswell, and speaking with some of the honest and decent residents there, I will give my clear opinion on this subject: They did land, there was a cover-up by the government, and it continues to this day.",

The proof that something did actually take place like it had been reported was the letter from J Edgar Hoover to the White House I believe it was demanding that the FBI be granted access to the crash retrieval from Roswell New Mexico. There are many, many facts and testimonial evidences that have been recorded from people who have passed away now, and documentary evidence that have been gathered on this case that if it were brought before a Jury would find that the government is hiding something from the public.",

I was shouting, \u201cNo, look at it properly\u201d but she laughed and went back inside. I decided to ring a friend who lived in the direction it had gone, She answered and asked me to hold for a minute. She came back and told me that a UFO had just landed in the field behind her house and taken off again. I asked her to describe it, but she couldn\u2019t, all she could say was that it was a flying saucer. This was before I told her what I had seen. 2/ Around 2003. Saw a big black triangle with my son, it swung around and there was a red light beneath it. I dragged him inside. 3/10th October 2007 at precisely 02:21. At work on nights I saw what I first thought was a nuke. I thought if it is I\u2019m already dead, so I watched. It exploded high up in the clouds, brilliant white, then faded through yellow, orange, red and left a deep crimson perfect oval for several minutes, then it disappeared. Half an hour later it happened again, the same but in a slightly different position. This time I saw something silvery fly out of it upwards, at an angle of about 30\u201345 degrees.I wrote everything down, times etc. There was no sound but my ears hurt for a week. About a week later, I got to work and the two women there were scared and sat together at a desk, they told me a strange man was in the building. He was downstairs, yet I had just walked upstairs and not seen him. Every door downstairs was locked and the outside door had a security lock. He came up the stairs and beckoned me over to the window at the other end, he told me that sometimes there is a gas cloud that explodes in the air above the town and it isn\u2019t known what causes it. Remember I had told no-one. He was very tall, in casual trousers and shirt, white hair, well built, looked about 50 but fit and healthy. I got the strangest feeling from him and felt terribly uneasy. He said the neighbours had reported a smell of gas and that\u2019s why he was there. We had NO neighbours, the other half of the building was closed off at night and we were in an industrial area, no houses etc. Years afterwards, I worked for a utility firm, on nights again. The CCTV operator was in the same floor and he monitored cameras countrywide. I asked him if he had ever seen an exploding gas cloud. He looked at me oddly and said that gas has to be ignited from the ground, it can\u2019t just spontaneously explode in the air. So reasoning logically, what I saw was something that entered the atmosphere, then left again half an hour later.",

To this day, 701 of the sightings remain \"Unidentified.\" One of the first and most famous involved businessman and pilot Kenneth Arnold, who was flying near Mt. Rainer, Wash. on June 24, 1947, when he reportedly sighted nine unidentified flying objects. The press later used his various descriptions to come up with the term flying saucer.2.On July 8, 1947, Roswell, New Mexico's public information office announced the recovery of a crashed \"flying disc\" from a ranch near Roswell. The military said what was recovered was debris from an experimental surveillance balloon which was part of a classified program. Critics who charge the government with covering up the truth maintain that an extraterrestrial spacecraft and its occupants were found near Roswell a finding kept secret from the public.3.Captain Thomas Mantell, a 25-year-old pilot in the Kentucky Air National Guard, crashed and died on January 7, 1948, while pursuing a supposed UFO. Mantell was an experienced airman who had seen considerable action as a World War 2 pilot. The circumstances leading up to his crash have been a matter of dispute. The two pilots flying with Mantell were unable to clearly identify the object that was under pursuit.4.George Gorman's Depiction of a UFO Encounter over Fargo On Oct. 1, 1948, George F. Gorman, a pilot in North Dakota's National Guard, flying at night over Fargo when he spotted what he later described as an object with a blinking light. The only other authorized aircraft in the region was supposed to be a Piper Cub. Approaching the UFO, Gorman said it resembled a ball of light that grew brighter and accelerated as he got near it. In a later sworn statement to investigators, Gorman said: \"I am convinced that there was definite thought behind its maneuvers. I am further convinced that the object was governed by the laws of inertia because its acceleration was rapid but not immediate and although it was able to turn fairly tight at considerable speed, it still followed a natural curve. When I attempted to turn with the object I blacked out temporarily due to excessive speed. I am in fairly good physical condition and I do not believe that there are many if any pilots who could withstand the turn and speed effected by the object, and remain conscious. The object was not only able to out turn and out speed my aircraft...but was able to attain a far steeper climb and was able to maintain a constant rate of climb far in excess of my aircraft.\"5.What did - or didn't -- happen at the Otis Air National Guard Base near Cape Cod, Mass. in the 1950s? The base had been rumored to be involved in several UFO reports - including one in which a F-94C Starfire supposedly disappeared. The Air Force has never confirmed those claims.6.On November 23, 1953, First Lieutenant Felix Eugene Moncla, Jr. was ordered into the air to intercept an unidentified object that was tracked by radar operators in Sault Ste.

It appears they collided and one was not recovered until 1952, but the other one continued on and crashed just outside of the city of Roswell. When the Army Air Corps arrived on the scene the police and Fire Departments were already on the scene as well as some archeologists who saw the craft come down. The Army secured the scene and debriefed the witnesses. They suggested that keeping quiet was a matter of national security and since it was 1947 and Our troops were recently home from a war with Germany and Japan there was very little pushback. The Craft was secured and the bodies as well as one live alien were taken away. That was the end of the story as far as the army was concerned. They didn't know that a rancher named Mac Brazel was having trouble getting his sheep to cross a large field of debris caused by the collision. When he investigated it he believed it was from one of these flying discs everyone had been reporting. He took some to his neighbors and they all told him to take it into Roswell and show it to the authorities. He had no phone and the 75 mile trip would be an over nighter at least, so he waited a few days and made the trek. He had secretly hoped there might be a reward but mainly wanted help cleaning up the debris field which was 1/4 mile long and a few hundred feet wide. Weather ballons were a common nuisance. When they came down the livestock would ingest the material and the Army did not really find it necessary to recover them. When Brazel arrived in town he went to the police Department and after inspecting the material the sheriff told him to bring it to the base. I believe he saw Col. William \u201c Butch\u201d Blanchard, commanding officer of the 509th Bomber squadron. Blanchard inspected the material and directed his intelligence officer Maj Jesse Marcell to make the trip out to the ranch along with a CIC officer. A newspaper reporter was hanging around the office waiting for a scoop and Blanchard gave him the story. No Blanchard did not know about a recovery a few days earlier. That is not how secrecy works in the services. He was acting on his own observation and knowledge. The story made the headline of the Roswell newspaper and immediately after hitting the wires the story was all over the world. The police reported calls from as far as Japan. The next day Brazel and Marcel made the trip back to the Ranch and by the time they arrived it was dark so they sleped over night and headed out to the debris field the next morning. Maj Jesse Marcel was the intelligence officer for the 509th Bomber Squadron. The only Atomic bomber squadron on Earth. He was no slouch. he was tasked with being able to identify any aircraft enemy or otherwise. When he saw the debris he knew immediately that it was not anything from Earth. There was sheets of material that could be crumbled up in your hand and you could not even feel it yet when you let it go it flattened out without a wrinkle. you could not cut it tear it burn it and even a 45 cal bullet would not penetrate it, stick like material that could not be bent or broken, waifer like objects that had what looked like circuits printed on them, wire that could be tied into a knot and when light was held at one end it shone out the other end. (Paraphrased from interview with Marcel). They spent some time examining the material and loaded as much as they could fit into a car and military vehicle and headed back to Roswell. Marcel decided to make a detour to his house at 2AM and he woke up his wife and 11 rear old son to show them what he had. That night remained with Jesse Marcel Jr for the rest of his life. The next day when he reported, he was directed to the Base commander\u2019s office. Gen Roger Ramey was doing damage control and he had a cover story. Marcel and he inspected the material and then Ramey took Marcel into his office to show him on the map were the debris field was. The debris from the craft was removed and when Marcel emerged he was told to pose in front of debris from a weather ballon. The press was brought in and the chief meteorologist from the base was there to verify that it was a weather ballon. Suddenly the story of the millennium fizzles out and nothing more is mentioned in the press. There was still loose ends to clear up. Marcel was ordered to Ft Worth so that he could not talk to anyone. I suspect he was livid because of the embarrassment of him not being able to recognize a weather ballon. Mac Brazel was brought back to town for interrogation. Troops were sent out to the ranch and picked it clean. Precautions were taken. For security reasons only two enlisted men from each unit were used and everyone was told not to talk to anyone. That way no one could verify anything that happened. Officers were reminded of their oaths of secrecy and senior officers were reminded of their pensions. Police and fire personnel were reminded of their pensions and scientists were reminded of their grants. Even a local radio station was threatened with its license if it went ahead with an interview with Brazel. A young girl who was at the police department visiting her father was threatened about keeping quiet. The desert is a big place and no one will ever find your bones. When Brazel left town after 5 days of interrogation he was not talking but he was driving a brand new pickup. The ranch was searched as well as the neighbor\u2019s houses and even Marcel\u2019s residence. To date no one has come forward with any material from the crash. How convenient, not one shred of evidence. 50 years later the Air Force admitted it lied. It was not a weather ballon it was a Mogul Ballon,a top secret device sent up to identify atomic tests by the Russians. They kept the Mogul classified even longer than the U2, SR71, F111 stealth fighter and B2 stealth Bomber. Oh the reports of the alien bodies. They were crash dummies used for ejection seat tests wearing uniforms from 1952! This story went away and in the seventies and eighties when rumors would arise, personnel from Roswell would not even admit they were stationed there, even if they had not part in the event. It wasn\u2019t until Stanton Friedman was given Jesse Mrcel\u2019s name that the story gained any traction. Marcel was in his 80s and believed he had nothing to loose coming out with the truth. I have read 7 or 8 books about this event and It gave me a pretty good foundation for studying this phenomenon. The subject is a lot like studying Math you really can't start off with calculus you have to study Algebra and geometry and know your basic math first. Believe me there were more than a few times I can remember saying \u201cThats nuts But Roswell DID occur\u201d. What i walked away with is that 1 Alien life exists 2, They have been visiting since at least the 40s, 3 The government or factions of the Government know about it 4 They are making a concerted effort to keep it a secret even using lies and threats to maintain the secret. I have said this often on this site. Don't take my word for this do your own research. Don't go on line or on the TV. get a book and read it> A book must be published and go through an editorial process. That doesn't mean that everything you read in a book is true. But with all the misleading information and disinformation you are unlikely to get anything close to the truth on TV or the internet. I recommend Stanton Friedman, Kevin Randell and especially Dr Stephen Greer. Keep an open mind but remain skeptical and good luck",

The truth (as revealed when \u201cProject Mogul\u201d was declassified is not so interesting. In the late 40s, we were vastly interested in what the Soviets were doing with \u201cthe bomb\u201d. At the time, there were no spy satellites or U-2 aircraft. So, our intelligence guys thought we might be able to listen. By using a highly sensitive sort of microphone called a \u201cradiosonde\u201d, sent aloft by several weather balloons from the west coast, it was hoped that we could \u201chear\u201d any test explosions and extrapolate the size and intensity of the blast thereby. The radiosondes were sent up with an array of balloons, and a structure made of balsa wood and Mylar plastic sheeting. Mylar was new at the time and the only source was a toy manufacturer, so the material purchased had a lot of odd-looking symbols on it. Most of these simply went up, hung around over the ocean, and crashed into same after the balloons deflated. But one made it to Texas. A rancher found the pile of sticks, plastic, and electronics and thought it might belong to the Air Force which had a nearby base. The base sent out a couple of guys in a jeep and they picked up the bits and took them back to the commander. The commander had been briefed on this project and recognized the material\u2026 So he called the appropriate agencies. Who promptly arrived and took custody of this \u201csecret\u201d material. Meanwhile, the rancher began mentioning this odd occurrence to his friends and rumors very rapidly began to circulate about a \u201ccrashed UFO\u201d. The Air Force, eager to keep their secret project secret, fed into this rumor by flatly denying everything. (Figuring the Soviets would dismiss this as more crazy US nonsense. They were right.) The Air Force actually kept this program secret till the late 80s, and by that time the \u201ccrashed UFO\u201d story had grown all out of proportion and was now keeping the sleepy little town of Roswell alive as it had become a major tourist draw. The rancher got so annoyed at people trampling all over his land looking for the \u201ccrash site\u201d that the town officially \u201cmoved\u201d the site to a piece of public land nearby. Of course, the many UFO believers maintain that the above is all part of the conspiracy\u2026.",

I am giving only the top 5: 1) Aurora, TX Crash - 1897:- The Aurora, Texas, UFO incident is a UFO incident that reportedly occurred on April 17, 1897, in Aurora, Texas, a small town in the northwest corner of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex. The incident (similar to the more famous Roswell UFO incident 50 years later) reportedly resulted in a fatality from the crash. The alleged alien body is reportedly buried in an unmarked grave at the local cemetery.During the 1896\u20131897 timeframe (some six or seven years before the Wright Brothers' first flight), numerous sightings of a cigar-shaped mystery airship were reported across the United States.One of these accounts appeared in the April 19, 1897, edition of the Dallas Morning News. Written by Aurora resident S.E. Haydon, the alleged UFO is said to have hit a windmill on the property of a Judge J.S. Proctor two days earlier at around 6am local (Central) time, resulting in its crash. The pilot (who was reported to be \"not of this world\", and a \"Martian\" according to a reported Army officer from nearby Fort Worth) did not survive the crash, and was buried \"with Christian rites\" at the nearby Aurora Cemetery. (The cemetery contains a Texas Historical Commission marker mentioning the incident.)Reportedly, wreckage from the crash site was dumped into a nearby well located under the damaged windmill, while some ended up with the alien in the grave. Adding to the mystery was the story of Mr. Brawley Oates, who purchased Judge Proctor's property around 1945. Oates cleaned out the debris from the well in order to use it as a water source, but later developed an extremely severe case of arthritis, which he claimed to be the result of contaminated water from the wreckage dumped into the well. As a result,Oates sealed up the well with a concrete slab and placed an outbuilding atop the slab. (According to writing on the slab, this was done in 1957.) 2) Roswell UFO Retrieval:- The Roswell UFO incident took place in the U.S. in June or July 1947, when an airborne object crashed on a ranch near Roswell, New Mexico. Explanations of what took place are based on both official and unofficial communications. Although the crash is attributed to a secret U.S. military Air Force surveillance balloon by the U.S. government, the most famous explanation of what occurred is that the object was a spacecraft containing extraterrestrial life. Since the late 1970s, the Roswell incident has been the subject of much controversy, and conspiracy theories have arisen about the event.The United States Armed Forces maintains that what was recovered near Roswell was debris from the crash of an experimental high-altitude surveillance balloon belonging to what was then a classified (top secret) program named Mogul. In contrast, many UFO proponents maintain that an alien craft was found, its occupants were captured, and that the military engaged in a massive cover-up. The Roswell incident has turned into a widely known pop culture phenomenon, making the name \"Roswell\" synonymous with UFOs. Roswell has become the most publicized of all alleged UFO incidents. 3) UFOs over Washington DC, 1952:- The 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident, also known as the Washington flap or the Washington National Airport Sightings, was a series of unidentified flying object reports from July 12 to July 29, 1952, over Washington, D.C. The most publicized sightings took place on consecutive weekends, July 19\u201320 and July 26\u201327.4) Travis Walton Case 1975:- Travis Walton (born February 10, 1953) is an American logger who was supposedly abducted by a UFO on November 5, 1975, while working with a logging crew in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in Arizona. Walton could not be found, but reappeared after a five-day search.  The Walton case received mainstream publicity and remains one of the best-known instances of alleged alien abduction. UFO historian Jerome Clark writes that \"Few abduction reports have generated as much controversy\" as the Walton case. It is furthermore one of the very few alien abduction cases with corroborative eyewitnesses, and one of few abduction cases where the time allegedly spent in the custody of aliens plays a rather minor role in the overall account. UFO researchers Jenny Randles and Peter Houghe write that \"Neither before or since has an abduction story begun in the manner related by Walton and his coworkers. Furthermore, the Walton case is singular in that the victim vanished for days on end with police squads out searching \u2026 it is an atypical 'Close Encounter: Fourth Kind' (CE4) \u2026 which bucks the trend so much that it worried some investigators; others defend it staunchly.\" (Randles and Hough, 186) 5) Rendhelsham Forest Incident, 1980:- The Rendlesham Forest incident is the name given to a series of reported sightings of unexplained lights and the alleged landing of a craft or multiple craft of unknown origin in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, England, in late December 1980, just outside RAF Woodbridge, used at the time by the U.S. Air Force. Dozens of USAF personnel were eyewitnesses to various events over a two- or three-day period. It is the most famous UFO event to have happened in Britain, ranking amongst the best-known UFO events worldwide. Along with the Berwyn Mountain UFO incident, it has been compared to the Roswell UFO incident in the United States, and is sometimes referred to as \"Britain's Roswell\"  The Ministry of Defence (MoD) denied the event posed any threat to national security, and stated that it was therefore never investigated as a security matter. Later evidence indicated that there was a substantial MoD file on the subject, which led to claims of a cover-up; some interpreted this as part of a larger pattern of information suppression concerning the true nature of unidentified flying objects, by both the United States and British governments (see the UFO conspiracy theory). One person to take this view was eyewitness and Deputy Base Commander Colonel Charles Halt (see below). Another was former NATO head and UK Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Peter Hill-Norton, who stated whatever happened at this USAF base was necessarily of national security interest. However, when the file was released in 2001 it turned out to consist mostly of internal correspondence and responses to inquiries from the public. Sceptics note that the lack of any in-depth investigation in the publicly released documents is consistent with the MoD's earlier statement that they never took the case seriously. Included in the released files is an explanation given by defence minister Lord Trefgarne as to why the MoD did not investigate further. The sightings have been explained as misinterpretation of a series of nocturnal lights \u2013 a fireball, the Orford Ness lighthouse and bright stars."
